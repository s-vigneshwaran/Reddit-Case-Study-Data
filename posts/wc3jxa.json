Women are innocent until proven guilty; men are guilty until proven innocent. \n\nWhat I would like to know is *why* are so many fake accusations on the rise? What is the root of these lies and motivations?",

One records pilots conversions and announcements, the other is to record to help reconstruct what happend with the plane leading up to the crash. Are you suggesting planes should do away with these because plane crashes are rare? \n\n\nI was certain you didnt, by the time I was 13 I knew at least 5 girls who falsely accused younger men and a few boys of rape. 2 of the girls had the audacity to openly brag that they were never raped but wanted to ruin their reputation. At least one was cheating on their boyfriend and when the boyfriend found out, she claimed the boy she was cheating with raped her.",

This is her methodology:\n\n> > Although consideration of male victims is within the scope of the legal statutes, it is important to restrict the term rape to instances where male victims were penetrated by offenders. It is inappropriate to consider as a rape victim a man who engages in unwanted sexual intercourse with a woman.\n\n\n[NISVS 2010](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/nisvs_report2010-a.pdf) showed that in the past 12 months, 1.1% of men were made to penetrate and 1.1% of women were raped. Look at Table 2.1 and 2.2 on pages 18 and 19 respectively.\n\n[NISVS 2011](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/ss/ss6308.pdf) showed that in the past 12 months, 1.7% of men were made to penetrate and 1.6% of women were raped. Look at Table 1 on page 5.\n\n[NISVS 2012](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/NISVS-StateReportBook.pdf) showed that in the past 12 months, 1.7% of men were made to penetrate and 1.0% of women were raped. Look at Table A.1 and A.5 on pages 217 and 222 respectively.\n\n[NISVS 2015](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/2015data-brief508.pdf) showed that in the past 12 months, 0.7% of men were made to penetrate and 1.2% of women were raped. Look at Table 1 and 2 on page 15 and 16 respectively\n\n\n\nVaries a bit from year to year, but pretty even overall. In both cases the four year annual percentages add up to five. The numbers for perpetrators vary a little from year to year too. Something like 79-84% of made to penetrate (nonconsensual envelopment) victims are victimized by women. Something like 96-99% of rape (nonconsensual penetration) victims are victimized by men. So in the 2010s, it averages out that a typical year has about 60% men and 40% women as perpetrators of nonconsensual sex outside prisons rather than the 99/1 ratio typically discussed.\n\nAgain, in 2010s about equal victims and 60/40 perpetrator split between the sexes when talking about *nonconsensual sex* rather than narrowly defined rape.\n\nIf you don't like the CDC surveying victims...\n\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/sexual-victimization-by-women-is-more-common-than-previously-known cites among other things an academic study of perpetrators.\n\n> A recent study of youth found, strikingly, that females comprise 48 percent of those who self-reported committing rape or attempted rape at age 18-19.\n\nor\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/11/the-understudied-female-sexual-predator/503492/ cites a NIH study that includes self reported perpetrators.\n\n> National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions found in a sample of 43,000 adults little difference in the sex of self-reported sexual perpetrators. Of those who affirmed that they had \u2018ever forced someone to have sex with you against their will,\u2019 43.6 percent were female and 56.4 percent were male.\u201d\n\nBoth those articles are really informative and shocking to people who have just been listening to the narrative.",

For that, you would have to have reliable statistics from say, 10 years ago, 20 years ago, and today, and actually be able to see an upward trend. All those stories you listed are terrible but they don't prove that false accusations are on the rise, they may just, for example, prove that false accusations are on the media's radar more than before and so being reported more.

An entire fraternity house was vandalized and dismantled due to a false rape allegation. The truth came out because \"Jackie's\" friends noticed holes in her story and her behaviour (refusing to report it to the police, not seeking medical help).\n\nA 17 year old boy was accused by a female of sexual assault, but her claim was proven false.

You can\u2019t just talk about the performance of societies while looking at the overall quality of the population. It isn\u2019t like one society is doing better than another just because their output has more of this or more of that.\n\nThird: the \"decrease in general population IQ\" and the \"worship of celebrities\" are consequences of a set of factors. Not only feminism. I don\u2019t know if they could have been avoided. But they would not have been as bad if the United States had not neglected public education, for example. This whole cultural crisis could be understood by different perspectives that don\u2019t take feminism as a key factor. For example, we could understand it as the normal and logical continuation of the mass culture of the XX century\u2019s last decades.",

And every time a man's perception got into the talk, the answer was to silence him. I remember a time when I asked a girl what the main opinions were on a specific topic in a closed feminist community on Facebook, with the authentic interest of understanding her perception to adequate\u00a0myself. I didn't care about the group itself; it was more about talking to her, because she was a friend. And she wouldn't talk about anything that had been discussed there. See? We were even denied silent listening. And now... you, a feminist, are here,\u00a0in an ati-feminist group... Being treated as a human being.\n\nSo let's keep things clear. I have no bond of political or existencial loyalty with you. And I don't have to offer you anything but the fundamental right to not suffer physical violence. I don't have to offer your movement any support, because I don't have to offer any support to a movement incapable of accepting my mere free existence. I don't have to deal with you like there was consensus about our peaceful coexistence because in the past years your movement cut all the channels of communication it could with us and is still disturbing communication between men and women. Whether you are or are not a feminist is irrelevant, because we are not talking about you. We are talking about the conditions for men to live.\u00a0You won't be around every time a man needs help and understanding, and your political movement is denying men's conditions to talk about their issues. You won't change the perverse way feminism works against men just because you are the \"good girl.\"\n\nIt's funny to see a feminist argue after the past 7 years that \"she believes in equality\". Your movement accepts no exceptions from men. There are no \"good guys\" except the ones who agreed to keep their mouths shut. You are so quick to demand responsibility from individual males for the actions of other males, as if we were an organized demographic. And now I have to \"accept\" you as a \"different feminist\", considering that feminism is a\u00a0political field with expression in political parties, universities, social movements, social networks, and systematic thinking? Wake up. You girls burned the bridges. I have no reason to accept your feminism as real or as relevant.",

I haven\u2019t broken any rules of this sub, I haven\u2019t degraded anyone on this sub, and I have shown a lot of restraint when being insulted. Could most your protestors who have been banned say the same? \n\nFurthermore, and on a serious note, how do you expect to be taken seriously if you only discuss your views with people who agree with you? Staying huddled in a sub building on hate without allowing for much else seems a lot like most extremists groups posted here.",

I'm talking about the objective conditions for men to talk about themselves. It isn't about you, it isn't about me, and if you don't get it, you shouldn't be talking about social issues.\n\nThird, I'm not shutting myself. I'm looking for spaces free of feminists, like this group, to talk freely about society. And I don't really care if feminists are shutting themselves because I don't care about feminists. But let's understand one thing here. I didn't make the situation of the public debate about the sexes and genders what it is now. People like me are giving up talking with feminists and how feminists talk because of how feminists deal with them. In the past 8 years, you had everything. Feminists had the monopoly on the moral judgement of social issues in political debates. I know this because I was a leftist who gave you the support you required of us.
