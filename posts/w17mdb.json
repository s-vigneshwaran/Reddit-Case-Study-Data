It's unenforceable in practical terms. Logistically, financially, legally, it wouldn't work.  \n  \n2. The constitution explicitly bars states from restricting interstate travel, and undoing that would require a lot more than any configuration of the SCOTUS could deliver.  \n\n3. IANAL but the 4th amendment definitely covers the intrusive surveillance constituted by compulsory pregnancy tests before and after interstate travel.  \n\n4. Again, IANAL Title IX prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex. They ban abortion for both men and women, so even though it only affects people assigned women at birth, it's not 'discriminatory' in that sense. Forcing women exclusively to submit proof of pregnancy status is, fundamentally, discrimination on the basis of sex. Good luck convincing conservative dudes to allow laws that make them submit pregnancy tests.",

Plenty of things under Trump that should gotten an injunction didn't. Many of the people responsible for that are still judges. \n\n\n>Hell, the states that would pass something like that would depend on the injunction so that they can reap the performative benefits of passing the law without having to invest the money, time, and energy into implementing it. \n>\n\nMaybe, maybe not. They haven't been content with that so far. \n\n>>They are accomplishing their goals and at this point it's ridiculously clear that \"The system will save us!\" isn't real.  \n>  \n>I agree. The system is designed to slow down change so that there are multiple election cycles to confirm voters actually want to continue in a certain direction.  \n>\n>As for 'accomplishing their goals', the people leading the right have no ideology. They don't give a fuck about abortion, they just want to trick the voters that do into believing they're on the same page. \n\nPlenty of leaders on the right do, in fact, personally hate abortion. It's not like they indoctrinate the youth to hate abortion, then, when they become powerful, let them in on The Secret that they don't *actually* care about abortion. Plenty of people in power hate abortion, are actually racist, etc, etc. Every single politician is not being performative.\n\nAnd even if they were, what does it matter? If my neighbor set my house on fire it's absurd to tell me \"Eh, burning you alive isn't their real goal. They're actually trying to distract from a larger crime. Stop distracting us from the real problem with your burning house.\" Even if you're right and this is a distraction, the fires they're setting have to be taken seriously.\n\n>The party itself will do the least amount of work for the most political gain - which here means pretending to care about abortion while redirecting the resources this kind of law would require to something even more sinister and pointed, like dismantling voting rights or codifying protections for extralegal police actions.\n\nPlease explain the huge, huge amount of effort that have been put in so far, then. Why overturn Roe v. Wade? Under your theory, the easiest thing to do is just keep flogging it with their base but never actually overturn it because there goes their distraction. Instead they've spent decades and huge amounts of time and money getting us here.\n\nI'm so sick of this notion that the problem isn't the *Real* Problem\u2122. Everything isn't a distraction from whatever the speaker's pet cause is. Absolutely voter suppression is important and needs to be stopped, but *so does this*.",

They're not merely killing women and children, no. There's also something *really* bad they're doing. \n\nYou said not to worry because even if they do it it won't last long enough to kill enough people to matter. *Even after they overturned Roe* you're still claiming we don't have to worry, they'll tucker themselves out. This really makes it seem like you consider abortion access a good thing, but not something to fight for in and of itself. That's not my side. That's a fairweather friend who expects my support but considers my reality a distraction. \n\nI see that attitude a lot from leftists on a wide variety of topics, and it really makes me worry if they're on my side in a way I can count on. The left has a very long history of punting on the rights of women and minorities because they're \"identity politics\" or a distraction from class issues or whatever, and it sucks.",

You said it's all a distraction while they do something \"more sinister,\" and defined that as things like voting rights or shielding cops. You didn't say word one about putting energy towards the current issues around abortion, you only declared that the Real Issue isn't abortion, it's cops and voting.\n\nFor the rest, I never thought you were anti-abortion, and I didn't say anything about changing the state of Roe v. Wade. I'm saying overturning it was, up until a few weeks ago, the canonical \"Calm down, we don't have to worry about it. They'll never do it.\" My point was they did it after all, they'll keep doing stuff we think they can't, and we need to wake up to that. \"They can't pull it off\" isn't safe anymore. It hasn't been for decades and I'm sorry people still can't see that. \n\nCheers.",
