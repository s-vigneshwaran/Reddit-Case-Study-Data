  "text": "TIFU by cheating on my wife with a fictional woman\nI'm not a native speaker of Da Inglish so please bear with me. \nTL;DR at the bottom as this sub requires a minimum of 750 characters per post.  \n\nA couple of days ago my wife had a dream where I cheated on her and later leaving her to live with the other woman. She told me about her dream in the morning, clearly distressed. Trying to defuse the situation, I decided to create a funny origin story of the girl I was seeing in her dream. I named her Brumhilda, as this name doesn't exist where we live and I thought it added volume and certain mystery to her character. \n\nThe next day I posted a funny comment on a Facebook page, and received a Haha reaction from a user named Brumhilda. I thought it was hilarious and showed it to my wife, who promptly sent me to sleep on the sofa\n\nTL;DR\n\nWife dreams I'm cheating on her, I try to turn lemons to lemonade only to be shafted by Murphy's Law and my own stupidity",

God could be hiding in a spider hole in Tikrit Iraq or on some exoplanet in a distant galazy.\n\nOn further reflection on the state of the world I have changed to being an antitheist.

I'm a very light and defensive sleeper. It happened a few times (cheating dreams included) do you know how hard it is to comfort your girlfriend after she just slapped the shit out of you, in a good sleep trying to calm her down.

And then I realize that our relationship is demanding a new level of trust and commitment from me,  and a willingness to be vulnerable and risk being hurt. People think that all happens at the beginning of hte relationship and then you make a commitment and it's done, but the longer you are with someone,  the more vulnerable to each other you both become, and so the decision to stay needs to be repeated even (especially?) in the most healthy and loving relationships where the risk isn't present in the day to day so dreamworld is the only place to deal with it.",

To expect your reader to understand it as something like a physical attack metaphor and thus parse your phrase as dampening the situation feels like quite a stretch.\n\nMaybe diffusing OP's situation does work if trying to express connotations of *spreading* the situation (i.e. something like deflecting emotions onto other people or making things more complicated) but that wasn't what OP was trying to express and, to me, changes the meaning.",

My mother is named after the virgin mother of Christ and her personality can't be any more pure, literally always thinking about others and giving to people in need, always! As for me, I used to lucid dream at will when I was younger, without fail. I once dreamt of a girl I never met before, on the first day of middle school, I met that girl irl, she was a classmate and I think we shared the same dream. Anyways,\n\n\nTL;DR: I can't say I don't believe in dreams being somewhat connected to space/time spiritually.",

She stormed into our room on her birthday and I was still asleep (was like 6am) and she's like \"that's it if you won't get up on my birthday then I want you out!!\" I literally stood up and was like \"okay if that's what you want\" and started packing my stuff up. She then started to cry and said she didn't mean it and that she was sorry but this was literally the 10+ time she told me she wanted me gone so I told her I wasn't putting up with being treated like this anymore and left.",

I don\u2019t think she ever noticed her flippant responses were actual probabilities and suggestions, because she was pretty blindsided about me leaving our perfect relationship [to her]. It wasnt me just packing bags, it was a team of movers I had booked coming lol. I told her the night before so that was the breakup.\n\nDont say what you dont mean! \n\nAlso lol to all the people paranoid about their relationship, trigger warning! people leave.

Maybe saying something I shouldn't have, or doing something with no ill intention that could look bad, but sending someone to the couch has a certain _weight_ to it, and a certain persistence. You send them and the rest of the night happens, it's not an inopportune phrase that slips in an instant. Way too aggressive and toxic to be acceptable.\n\n\nAlso, it's just humilliating and submissing. I wouldn't accept being sent to the couch, you go instead or just gtfo as a whole.",

Same reason people wake up still distraught from a nightmare or chirpy all morning from a happy dream. It\u2019s just a dream, why react this way? There\u2019s no logic in a person who just woke up and is angry in a dream. However I do admit that I don\u2019t act crazy, I just play angry like \u201cOy you cheated in me in my dream, you owe me a kiss and a hot chocolate\u201d type of thing and we laugh it off",

Rounding everyone's age down to just the number of years they've been alive and then putting them all in one group based on that means people born on X and Y month are going to spend all of their formative years as the youngest or oldest in their class, which is going to have a huge impact. There are so many little factors like this, and I don't think it's a massive stretch to say there are elements of this whole dynamic which could have pattern recognition applied to them on a general population-wide level.\n\nGoing from there, simplifying the whole process to something more manageable which relies on abstract metaphor and fun symbology would make the whole thing easier, yeah?\n\nI'm not into astrology myself, but it can be fun to make a genuine effort to try to reason out how things you don't agree with could have merit.",

Turned out, he was cheating so she divorced him.  \nYears later, years after we married, she began accusing me of cheating. Turned out, she was having an emotional affair with someone at the other end of the Internet.  \nSo if your wife is giving you grief over her dream of you cheating? There is a very short list of possibilities here:  \n1. She is cheating, feels guilty but won't stop so takes it out on you  \n2. She is cheating, blames & accuses you of cheating to assuage  \n3. She is diagnosable for paranoia and probably more, per DSM-V\n\nPick any one, any two are probably correct here.",

They think every Feeling, thought, dream and emotion is tied into reality when the exact opposite is true. \n\nMen live in the real 3rd dimensional world of linear logic, order, facts, exactness, truth. \n\nWomen live in a WORLD of emotions, feelings, fantasy, pretend, make believe, illusion, delusion, proper grammar, polite conversation, attractive clothing & correct opinions! To them.. This IS REALITY and whatever they FEEL is reality or think it should be is what it IS no matter HOW MUCH evidence to the contrary exists because again, they think they're feelings are all in touch with God and also.. That they're NEVER WRONG. \n\nThis is why when dating they have this complete ILLUSION of how a BF and husband is supposed to behave, what he's going to do for her, to her, with her etc and if you DON'T DANCE to her IMAGINARY TUNE & List, she'll either make your life Miserable or just leave because you didn't follow her DIRECTIONS on her list in her fucking head that SHE ASSUMES that every man KNOWS & agrees to abide by BC a man's JOB is to validate, support & do whatever she says to make her feel comfortable for the next 30 seconds until hey unstable hormone driven emotions that are constantly in flux changes her mood and now you have to see the future & \"just know\" what she needs next or the cycle repeats! \n\nEvery man living with a woman is living with a Mental patient & insane being to a greater or lesser degree. \n\nI had a friend Scott who had a boy and girl that were 8 and 10. The mom had a \"FEELING\"out of the blue that he was molesting the kids and without warning she called the fucking cops. \n\nThey knocked on the door and he didn't know WTH was going on and he was beyond Stunned When the cops told him his wife called and accused him of as he'd totally dedicated to his family.. he was beyond floored and hurt to his core that his wife could even THINK such a thing. \n\nThey asked the kids alone one at a time and they were just as blown away by what they're mom said so the cops knew nothing happened but they were very close to arresting him. \n\nHe's a strict Catholic and after that he was very close to divorcing her. Even months later are STILL believed her fucking idiotic dream OVER the words of her husband and kids. Just as yours believes her STUPID DREAM over your word and having ZERO evidence. To women . FEELINGS are all the \"evidence\" they ever need! \n\nhttps://youtu.be/5_5quJu_QcE",

So many of my exes would get annoyed at me because they had a dream I did something bad and I didn't take it seriously, but as far as I'm concerned, they're behaving like children.. no one over the age of 12 should taking out their upset over a dream on people in real life. \n\nI suffer from cPTSD from being physically, emotionally and then sexually abused culminating in 19 years of near daily trauma. I suffer with insomnia, mainly due to the horrific flashbacks I get 99% of the time instead of a dreaming. I've had loads of nightmares where my current partner at the times face replaced the abusers face and woken up in sheer panic. I still didn't blame my partners for it and make them sleep on the sofa. Show your wife this message and maybe she'll realize how pathetic it is to create an emotional divide and essentially try to punish you for something you weren't even a part of that her subconscious made up.",
