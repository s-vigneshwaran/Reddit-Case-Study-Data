Like I got a direct shot in the eyes, but it never fully blinded me. \nResearching it later, I learned that bear spray is actually less potent than human pepper spray or mace. Apparently, the first poor bastards that tested it, found that when they used full strength spray, it just pissed off the bears and *made* them attack. The less potent spray annoys them without making them defensive.",

Also they don't just let them go hunt any animal they want after paying the fee, they only allow it when there are certain circumstances; there have been times when there was an old/senile rhino that was actually attacking other younger rhinos or other animals, even preventing the younger rhinos from mating because he was possibly angry that he was no longer mating, or just because of dementia or some other mental defect due to being senile... basically an animal that needed to be put down, as sad as that might be.   But instead of putting it down themselves, they figure they can sell a single-use license to a wealthy hunter, and fund their park which would otherwise have near zero funding in an otherwise very poor country.\n\nWithout these trophy hunters in certain parts of Africa, poachers would be allowed to do whatever they want and cause complete havoc within those ecosystems.  If there is one group of people you can truly be angry at, it's poachers and everyone who supports and works in that industry.",

There's plenty of other sources to look. I'm actually calm, you are the one that's making blanket statements about important people in our society that help keep these places accessible. Trophy hunters also help find the preserves, the tags that hunters but are issued by parks services that are monitoring the local population. Often times the ones you'd consider \"just for sport\" are larger males that can be injuring females during breeding, or killing younger males and stagnating the local gene pool. It's not just hicks in trucks shooting stuff, those are called poachers. It's like saying campers are the problem, they leave trash behind and shit in shallow holes. Is that true? Only about the worst examples. Which is what you're choosing to represent as hunters.\n\n\n\nI like how you conveniently chose not to answer any of my questions and only ask for sources, but me ignoring one part of yours is not having a conversation. Maybe try having one yourself?",

I know this because I've used both bear spray and pepper spray on a human and have had it used on me. Despite the higher scoville rating of pepper spray however, bear spray is way more painful for a human, because instead of receiving a concentrated blast to a small portion of your body, you are instead covered from head to toe in a diluted, but powerful substance. Do not recommend using bear spray indoors, or on a human. Your self defense case may become assault w/ deadly weapon case, since bear spray is designed for bears. However, if you're in a situation where you need to defend yourself vs. multiple humans or dogs or something, bear spray would probably be more effective than pepper spray.",

We got into an argument while I was driving, I told her to gtfo and she decided to spray me at a red light before she left the car. I went to a liquor store nearby ran in and just started dumping milk on myself. Didn't even have to pay for the milk the shopowners wanted me gone.\n\nfirst time meeting bear spray I was selling weed to a middle eastern dude and he robbed me with a can of bear spray. I complied with his requests and he still sprayed me. He was standing outside of my car and sprayed in, i thought something much worse happened for a second because of the blistering pain and got out of my car and laid on the concrete in fetal position for probably 10 minutes before I tried to get in my car and drive away. It wasn't happening, the shit was too strong so I left my car in the parking lot and had a buddy pick me up. To this day I feel like I can taste the burn.\n\nI decided bear spray was better vs. a gun for me to own since I didnt want to kill anybody but was selling alot of weed in a bad town in California. So I bought a couple cans from big 5 and kept one close. One day I was buying a large amount from a seller I never met, I meet him in a small parking lot behind a ghetto ass liquor store and he's black (which as bad as it sounds is a red flag in the drug selling business) so I'm on alert. He gets out and 2 more black guys get out of the car. So it's like I already know whats about to happen. He tries to get in the rear driver's side door and one of the other guys tries to get in rear passenger when I lock the doors and manage to get out a \"nah homie\" before the guy that was hanging around their car says \"shit we can do it this way too\" rushing my door and drawing a pistol. I had the bear spray in my hand and removed the safety tab as soon as I saw I was dealing with black folk though, and was spraying out the window way before homeboy even got his gun out. Him and and the dude on rear driver's side were on the ground, and the rear passenger guy booked it. Their 90s Camry look like it got hit up with a orange foam gun. I drive away but didn't realize that shit would affect me as the sprayer. I had to pull over cuz I was in tears just from spraying the shit away from me. Bear spray no joke.\n\nAs for using pepper spray on somebody, just realized I actually havent so don't have a story there.\n\nAnd on my nightstand is a fresh can of bear spray. I don't sell weed anymore though, so it'll probably be there for awhile.",

The guy would not give be the bear spray until I did. \n\nI do not know if there are different types. The Instructions clearly stated **do not spray the bear**. If you see a bear, and it is threatening you, spray the ground in front of you (between the bear and you), or a tree trunk next to you. \n\nBear spray only works for a short time, up to an hour. You want to leave the area you sprayed, as it will attract bears after the spray wears off. Apparently bears like the taste of cayenne in small doses.",

I can only imagine everything that goes into being a park ranger. Coming across homeless and/or addicts must be rough. I ran into a homeless/addict person at a Waffle House and he asked for the time, a cigarette, $5, and $10. I could only give him the time.

Our tornado sirens are now more high wind sirens because the winds are becoming consistently strong enough to knock down branches and whole trees.\n\nDerecho storms are becoming more likely threats than they ever used to be. We no longer see the cold & warm fronts passing over our state constantly like we used to. Shit has really gone weird. I'm not an expert, but I've been watching pressure & temp fronts since I was a kid (my dad was old and watched local news religiously), which is about 30 years or so.\n\nAll the temp & pressure fronts seem to be over the Appalachian Mountain area rather than the midwest. For us Iowans, this means more unilateral wind storms going west to east and less severe temperature changes as we don't get the warm front pushing up the Mississippi River as much.\n\nInstead, the warm fronts are climbing the coasts and squeezing the cold front down the Mississippi River.  Keeping our state cooler than the coasts, but not cold enough for snow.",

Impossible! \n\nBut on a real note, the whole idea that the democratic party is always right and vote blue no matter who is ridiculous. I am a democrat living in tennessee and i can tell you the democrats here are hopeless when it comes to our electoral processes. They don't realize if they would drop the anti 2A bullshit and focus on funding our broken education system, reforming our modern day slavery prison complex, and helping improve the lives of your regular tennessean, they would flip tennessee blue in 30 - 40 years. But no, with barely any funding and priorities focused elsewhere, the GOP is free to spread their bullshit fear mongering lies to the people of tennessee unchallenged. I say all this to say this, both parties suck, one more than the other but they both absolutely suck and are not \"for the people\" as they claim.",

Both sides have points politically when it comes to issues, but I mentioned that the democratic party shoots itself in the foot and isn't helpful to the taxpayer. I agree with you that the republican party, especially now, is becoming extreme in their ideology which currently is the opposite of whatever the democratic party is doing. They have completely destroyed public trust in the supreme court and staged an insurrection just recently. Both can be true, both parties are power hungry authoritarian parties that appeal to voters to remain in power, one uses fear mongering and one uses broad appeal. Both suck, even if the republicans suck more. Calling people uneducated because of their political choice is stupid however as both parties have issues that they like to focus on, and if one person deems the issues the republican party focuses on more valuable then more power to them.",

There would be very few households in the country that don't have a can laying around.\n\nThe stuff you spray on yourself we're more likely to refer to by a somewhat genericised trademark.\n\nAlmost everyone in Australia will know that 'aerogard' or 'rid' means 'bug repellent', regardless of what brand you have laying around.",

When she came back with 2 cans of Raid, I asked what she\u2019d asked for at the store. She said bug spray. I had to tell that Off is bug repellent and Raid is a pesticide. Her next question was could she use the bug spray. I told that she could but she could probably only do it once.",

The dude refused. \nFinally the pilot had to depart and taxied down the lake. As he took off past Mr. NatGeo, he saw the him uncontrollably flopping on the ground. \nDude maced himself spraying it like it was fucking Uncle Bens and bear spray is apparently 3x as concentrated as pepper spray btw.",

Here is something quoted by the PBS:\n\n1.If you encounter a grizzly, do not run.\r  \n2.Avoid direct eye contact.\r  \n3.Walk away slowly, if the bear is not approaching.\r  \n4.If the bear charges, stand your ground (you cannot outrun it).\r  \n5.Don't scream or yell. ...\r  \n5.If you have pepper spray, prepare to use it.\n\nThere is some good info on this page from the NPS Yellowstone page:\n\n[https://www.nps.gov/yell/learn/nature/bearreact.htm](https://www.nps.gov/yell/learn/nature/bearreact.htm)\n\nI'm stunned by the amount of people who get too close to animals whenever I head to a NP.",

Bear spray is one of those things that's nice to have but you needa firm understanding of how it works to use it effectively. \n\nA common misconception I see is that it's like pepper spray. It's much more intense in its effects and the actual act of spraying it nothing like pepper spray. The can releases in a massive cloud  for a good distance. The idea is to create a wall between you and the bear that it's not going to walk into. If you wait until the bear is right in front of you, there's still a chance you're getting hurt. This of course means the wind matters which is not something people think of when being charged by a bear. I've heard several stories of people emptying a can only to have it all blow back on them. \n\n The story in the original post happens semi frequently. Families genuinely do spray themselves with bear spray thinking it's a repellant but wind up with an aerosolized cloud of burning hell.",

Jim did not back off. This was in my campsite. Bob sprayed jim point blank with bear spray. Jim had bearspray in liquid form dripping off of him. I was in a different tent so I didn't know what was happening I just heard jim scream and saw him running. He fell over and was still screaming and wouldn't open his eyes so I helped him up and guided him to the medhut. He had so much bearspray on him that I got it on me in liquid form from just contact. It burned like someone was pressing coals to my body for over 12 hours. As for jim, once he went into the medhut I didn't see him again but I heard him screaming his lungs raw while they were taking my statement. He would scream and then go quiet for a like 12 seconds at a time so I can only assume the pain was so intense that he was blacking out. Overall a terrible night. Don't mess with bearspray kids.",
