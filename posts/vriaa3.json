It should be, people vote and the person who comes out on top wins but the Republicans know that if this was the case then they'd never win an election. I think there definitely needs to be dissenting voices to avoid absolute power but conservatism is not what it used to be. It's now extremism.",

The Dems have often been wusses -- they refuse to eliminate the filibuster yet never used it to stop harmful Trump villainy (like the appointment of three-count-em-three incompetent and right-wing injustices to SCOTUS, e.g.). It goes back to the way they utterly failed to take on Nixon & Reagan's Drug War policies (including racial profiling, a self-fulfilling prophecy) that have led to the mass incarceration and disenfranchisement of Black voters for minor crimes (often ones they probably didn't commit) as well as encouraging police brutality. It is not an effective way to deal with a drug problem because that was never the intent; it was designed to win over the South for Republicans and ensure that even where they were the majority Black voters would have little political power, and even if they managed to survive artificially inflated prison sentences they would still not be allowed to vote. All without (at least not obviously) violating the Voting Rights Act...which has pretty much been overturned anyway. And instead of fixing it, Clinton only made it worse! There have been a lot of other ways the Democrats have failed us, often because they were so frightened of \"alienating the center.\" Yet the way the US political system is set up -- in our Constitution, which is impossible to change for, you guessed it, political reasons -- we are stuck with two and only two parties. Third parties or independent candidates only \"spoil\" elections by taking votes away from whichever party is politically closest to them. It's really quite anticompetitive, and the \"money-is-speech\" BS only makes it harder to unseat either of the parties, *even* after one of them is practically a criminal organization, supporting an attempt by some of its supporters to violently overthrow the government, and installing judges in our highest courts who are happy to support this effort while working to eliminate any individual or civil rights that we may claim even under our imperfect Constitution. At the same time they are inventing nonexistent rights like a right to use guns for self-defence; a right to deprive others of their rights because you're their employer and you claim that your \"deeply held beliefs\" require you to do so -- but  only if they are religious beliefs (as noted, you can claim that they are and nobody is allowed to question you), and even then only if you are a fundamentalist or reactionary Catholic Christian; the right to break any law you want because you claim (again, right-wingers only, no evidence necessary) that it's against your religion; and so forth.\n\n(Err, I guess this post has sorta turned into a bit of a rant...sorry 'bout that.)",

The Senate likewise overrepresents less populous states, typically rural states which tend to be more right-wing, more religiously extremist, more racist, etc.\n\nWhile the Upper South today is more purple, the less populous states of the Deep South are still bright red, as are many still largely rural states in the Midwest and West. A lot of states, notably Texas and Florida, would be solidly blue due to their large urban and metropolitan populations, if it weren't for gerrymandering. A number of these, mainly in the South and Midwest, are slowly moving in a blue-ward direction, but are hampered by gerrymandering; a sure sign of this is a Democratic governor and a Republican-controlled state legislature. Many gerrymandered electoral maps are being thrown out by state Supreme Courts, but I think we need to pass a law to require that the lines be drawn by a bipartisan commission rather than by whatever party is in power when the census results are made available, and furthermore, states with serious gerrymandering problems need to be required to redraw their borders using the new commission; it is frankly too dangerous to wait until the 2030 census.",

They use different standards depending on whether they agree or disagree with a precedent, completely ignoring those they don't like while practically worshiping those they do; they don't have any consistent legal approach (they do consistently let their biases  guide them, but that's hardly a legal approach!), and they don't even bother pretending to be objective.",
