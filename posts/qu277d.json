I was just seeing if there were others like me or not, because they seem to be everywhere, and that's saying something as a cord cutter. \n\nYou have a good night.  Remember, not everyone on reddit is out to get you or start a fight.  Believe it or not, many of us are here just for conversations and learning.\n\nAnd I apologize in advance if I read your tone wrong, but \"its just not your thing lol\" comes off condescending as fuck, so maybe add in an /s or something if you are joking.  But I'm taking them as you looking to internet shame or fight someone, which is kinda sad, dude. i was just asking a legit question as I didn't understand their universal popularity, as wholesome as they are, all their jokes seem obviously set up and fake. It's like a rated G(PG/PG-13?) Jackass or Bam Margera. It's been done and I guess the market was there to corner... but it's not my thing...  and I asked if there were others that felt the same way. \n\nMaybe if you thought my comment was funny, hence the \"lol\" at the end, that would explain why you like their humor.",

Maybe the word has lost all meaning, and now really does just mean \"a media production of some sort in any form\"?\n\nIf so, that's what I'm complaining about.\n\nThis new definition of podcast literally applies to all episodic / divided media content. All of it. And I think that's stupid.\n\nA podcast should be a series of media files, available in a .RSS feed.\nPlain and simple.\n\nYou could record your poops and put them in a .RSS feed, and it would be a podcast. If you recorded your poops and put them in a series of YouTube videos, it would not be a podcast. Makes sense?",

If you enjoy watching them I'd recommend watching Chris's podcast [Chrissy Chaos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLe69CfLdqC17i4KlDFIju9uxQ0QXkvYPA). The guy is absolutely hilarious imo. \n\nThere's also the [Taste Buds podcast](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7PMrUjgVjnc4shC4m8OCa9-qGm4QdWyH) with Sal and Joe DeRosa. It's not as good as Hey Babe but still fun to listen to/watch.",

Because you learned it when you were young and lived your whole life with the understanding does not mean I also have. It's like that today's 10,000 xckd thing. \n\n\nI think its hilarious when I learn something and retrospectively realize how dumb I looked. Good example: I didn't realize the heart had blood pumped to it .. by it. I thought the heart would just like pick up some blood on its way through. So with this very shaky assumption I thought bypass surgery was some kind of rerouting of blood through the heart rather than how blood gets to the heart muscle itself. I was 30 when I learned that the heart has blood supplied to it. Super obvious. Just never had to think that thought before. \n\n\nI feel similarly about people learning about planets or basic history. Like there's very little need for people to know the order of the planets or what year was world world 2 ended. But it feels surprising to me that that isn't common knowledge. It's all perspective.",

I can clearly see you don\u2019t read a damn thing or you don\u2019t comprehend anything. As I wasn\u2019t talking to you or even asking for your input. If anything I was speaking to the original poster! So get on, idiot! Try and play grammar police on something or someone that gives a shit! Plus to try on this one I don\u2019t believe is wrong. Because their is possessive for that person\u2019s credentials. They\u2019re is only used for expressing readers thoughts other wise it\u2019s they are. You can remember that apostrophes indicate the possessive only when used of 's, such as \"the writer's thoughts.\" As it doesn\u2019t make sense they are credentials! It\u2019s not my thoughts credentials and so it wouldn\u2019t be possessive for my thoughts. Besides the fact that if it is incorrect (which I don\u2019t think it is) WHO GIVES A SHIT. I DIDN\u2019T USE THERE, I DIDN\u2019T ASK YOU, AND WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU ANYWAYS. A HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH GRAD. Big applause! Like I said in my last post to you I am not your friend, not your family, and your not my parent so play grammar police somewhere else. Don\u2019t need your correction. If the use of word changed the thought or made it unclear then add your two cents. But not needed here. I have a firm grasp of the language. \n \n\n\nJust to make it clear here is what Webster says. \nIn summary: There is the most common. It has the word here in it, which is helpful because it's often about location. They're always means \"they are.\" Their is the possessive form of they. They're is a contraction that means \"they are.\" You can remember that apostrophes indicate the possessive only when used of 's, such as \"the writer's thoughts.\" Otherwise, it's generally a contraction of two words, as in can't = cannot, or won't = will not, or an omission of a letter or letters, as in singin' for",

I am wondering how that is and what branch. As hyperthyroidism is a HUGE disqualification! They won\u2019t let you in if your blood tests come back with high T3 and T4. Unless you have either lied about being a vet, now your fat as hell and blame your thyroid for it when all it\u2019s trying to do is off set the fat your body is accumulating! Leave me alone and worry about you! Don\u2019t fucking message me and figure your issues.",
