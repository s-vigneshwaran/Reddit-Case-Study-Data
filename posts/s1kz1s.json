But, is having sex like this more acceptable than the process of acquiring, preparing, banging, and after effects/emotions of making sex with a blow up doll or those fake porn star rubber orfice molds? lmao it has to feel better, well atleast warm. now completely off topic this brings me to another weird conundrum...which is more of a homosexual act? when a homosexual eats a dude's vagina or sucks a chick's dick? science then fails us by putting us in these situations. lmao",
