As it stands, though, unwanted children are far more likely to live in poverty, turn to crime, or become drug addicts.\n\nThe combination of forced births plus no assistance seems calibrated specifically to maximize human suffering.

So no I don believe you deserve handouts I think women could pick better more stable partners instead of having kids with deadbeat losers. Hold yourself accountable instead of making everyone else in the world pay for you. That's called being an adult.",

There's a kind I always go for. A lot of times, they're used to soy boys at school, they've been to gender politics class, but just wrote down whatever the teacher said, and all they need is a man to come along and show 'em the way. \n\nAll you gotta do is keep the subject of gender politics on the DL, at first, of course. Dazzle them your knowledge of their beloved postmodern authors, various subjects, music, culture, whatever. They always read a cliff note Foucault, or some shit like that. But you know all the meaning behind it. Then a couple hours in, you're rounding third base, heading home. They've been around the block, sure, but they've never had a guy really laying pipe. After you open up those new worlds of experience to them, they are suddenly open minded about all the real knowledge out there. Pretty soon, they forget all about the paltry knowledge they learned in gender politics class, and their feminist friends are questioning where they stand.",
