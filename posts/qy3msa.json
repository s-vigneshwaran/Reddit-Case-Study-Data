It may be breaking hard rules of grammar, or if not, it is still breaking \u201csoft\u201d rules of grammar that are based around what you write making sense.\n\nThe buffalo one, as far as I can tell, breaks some hard rules by omitting passive versus active tenses of the verb (in order to make sense, at least one of the \u201cbuffalo\u201d uses should be \u201cbuffaloed\u201d). You can see this because the rephrasing includes the -ed ending to show how it is \u201csupposed\u201d to be grammatically correct.\n\nEdit: also if it helps, I\u2019m not sure these phrases are meant to be taken as unassailably grammatically correct, just grammatically correct *enough* that you can reasonably construct sentences this way. Like in everyday speech or art where a sentence is \u201cwrong\u201d if you write it for an English test, but still makes sense enough to not have to change how you say it",

I put them in parentheses because, in English, they aren't actually necessary.  See a sentence like this:\n\n> I was walking down the road Jane lived on.\n\nYou could also structure it like this:\n\n> I was walking down the road that Jane lived on.\n\nBoth are correct, and both are perfectly clear, one is just structurally more \"proper.\"  They're both grammatically correct.  Grammar does not have a \"scale of quality based on clarity.\"  See the following:\n\n> John saw a kid with binoculars.\n\nThis sentence is grammatically correct, but is not extremely clear because of structural ambiguity.  It could mean that John saw a kid who had binoculars, or that John used binoculars to see a kid.  This would require context to understand fully, but it is not less grammatical because of this lack of clarity.\n\nThe buffalo construction does not encourage bad writing, because it's taking advantage of already existing structures.  There is no structure in the sentence that is not grammatical.  I refer again to:\n\n> The type of men I like buys good flowers.\n\nThis is grammatically correct on all counts, yet has a very similar structure to the buffalo construction.  To give an example with even more similar structure:\n\n> The cats these people want eat small mice.\n\nThis is grammatically correct, and has the same structure: noun phrase modified by a clause, followed by a verb phrase.  None of this is ungrammatical, thus neither is the buffalo construction.  This is the reason the construction exists: it takes already existing structures and creates a sentence that uses only \"buffalo\" as a noun, verb, or adjective.\n\nThe point of teaching grammar is to help students understand the structures that exist, and especially the more common ones.  You're mistaking clarity as an inherent part of grammaticality.  In reality, grammaticality does not need to be clear, and it isn't always.  In fact, grammatically correct structures need not make any sense at all.  Just see the famous example by Noam Chomsky:\n\n> Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.\n\nGrammatically, this is entirely correct.  There is literally no way for you to argue with me on that.  It is one of the most standard structures in English, akin to:\n\n> Old brown dogs walk slowly.\n\nThe Noam Chomsky example is grammatical, but it obviously means nothing.  Deriving meaning and observing grammaticality are two completely different subjects.  Just because something is not clear in meaning does not mean it lacks grammaticality.  What I've shown here should illustrate this in spades.\n\nYes, teachers should encourage clarity in writing, of course.  However, the buffalo construction is neither ungrammatical nor encouraging poor writing.  Nobody is gonna read the sentence and think, \"Gosh, I should write a sentence with only the word *the* in my next essay!\"  It is something for people to muse on or simply find interesting and move on.  It is a thought experiment... and a fun fact.",

Aka to even argue it\u2019s proper grammar you need to ignore how grammar can be poor or fail to convey meaning if not constructed well\n\nEdit 2: don\u2019t take this too seriously. The Buffalos, buffalos, and buffalos have all buffaloed me\n\nEdit 3: I think I understand. It\u2019s missing the past tense version to correctly use the verb as an adjective: Buffaloed Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffaloed Buffalo buffalo. Two -ed endings are needed to make it make sense.",

There's little evidence to suggest that was the outcome with the certainty that you posed it as.  Like I said, take a tour around the rest of the comments here, there are plenty like yours claiming \"massive tissue damage\" (superficial wound to it's skin and maybe subcutaneous fat) \"it bled out\" (there's no visible blood) another comment suggesting the lion tore the animal's testicles off despite no visible lesion where they would have been as the animal is likely female.\n\nI admit I may not be articulating the point of my initial comment well but my opinion is that it's just a little odd for multiple similar comments to come in here and predict a grim and brutal death when what we see is an animal escaping certain death.\n\nI'm OK with animals being eaten, that's what happens in nature and I'm not a vegetarian myself. But most people don't want to think about animals suffering so why come in here and suggest *with apparent certainty* that this animal suffered greatly rather than triumphantly cheating death. That's what leads me to believe you're the weirdo who is almost relishing the more brutal outcome because you came here specifically to say it when you have no evidence to actually support it. Again, there's no blood visible, all the injuries the animal suffered were during the chase, not after the animal had been wrestled to the ground. It's entirely reasonable to suspect it survived the encounter.",

If it could talk, however, all of the herd\u2019s imaginations would expand, as they each played out the events in their minds, and they\u2019d be that much stronger in facing similar adversities. \n\nYou can see just how effective communication is for the species that have more capacity for it, like crows and primates, and it\u2019s really the primary advantage and distinction humans have over other animals. Our complete domination over the animal kingdom comes from our unparalleled ability to expand the minds of our families, tribes, and entire species.",

What I'm pointing out is the almost gleeful way that so many redditors comment on videos like these predicting an animal's demise. Buffalo are tougher than you think and if they were so fragile as to be unable to fight off any infection or take some degree of physical (and superficial) damage they wouldn't exist as a species.\n\nAlso, you don't think those lions are exhausted after taking down a big ass buffalo then fighting each other?

Excuse me? So I returned the favour. I looked through her previous comments and replied 'did you take 2 minutes away from OnlyFans to write that comment? I would rather not have much money than be flashing myself on OnlyFans'. I got banned. I got banned for 'shaming'. She did not.

The modal revenue is $0.00, and the next most common is $4.99.\nCreators put hours into each post, and on top of that, they interact one-on-one, with fans who can message them at any time. To break even on an OnlyFans account, creators need to earn more per month than the cost of hours spent engaging. The median take-home revenue is $136 per month. If you value a creator\u2019s time at a $15 minimum wage, the median creator needs to be spending less than 9 hours per month on her OnlyFans to break even. This is less than 20 minutes a day.\nFans expect regular, prompt engagement, and many creators compare OnlyFans to running a business. It seems unlikely that you could satisfy all your fans demands in less time than it takes to make and eat breakfast.\nRelative to effort, it looks like most accounts lose money.\n\n\nDownside is opportunity cost. Time spent on grooming, marketing, photo/video editing and customer engagement. Materials. \n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget that if you\u2019re successful, you\u2019re seen by many, which if caught can cost you any number of other jobs (teaching in public schools, highly skilled professional positions with \u2018ethics\u2019 being part of the licensure process, ordinary at-will work at a conservative company).  \n\nThere\u2019s a lot more than pride at stake. These choices when leaked into your personal life can wreak havoc and even compromise your physical safety, and by extension the safety of your child, depending on where you live. \n\nThese stigma driven downsides don\u2019t stop when you move on to other things. Any rational person would (at minimum) include the risk of lost wages elsewhere later in their calculation of whether the pay is enough to justify doing cam stuff while they\u2019re young and fit.",

The difficulty of securing a meal for these guys is no joke. It could be days or weeks before they get anything else. So it's surprising that this sort of behaviour happens. \n\nI suppose I'm oversimplifying because I'm not a biologist and am a bit of an idiot. Not to imply that nature is perfect. Just that such counterproductive behaviour is rare. Sure, weaker pride members might be culled after this. Actually yeah, that's probably literally it. Less lions = more water buffalo for everyone. Problem being that there's no guarantee that said stronger lions won't just starve after this.\n\nMan, I wish I were smart enough to have anything resembling an education \ud83d\ude14",

For humans, there are infinite possibilities and scenarios since, for the most part our immediate needs are met or easy to come by so our motivations could be anything. \n\nFor animals, it's survival. Food, reproduction, territory. Why they do anything falls into these categories. The hierarchy can be different - for this pride of lions at the top of the food chain, territory is obviously more motivating than food. Even when you see more complex behavior like loyalty, it's probably related to one of the three motivations. Love/loyalty is linked to who feeds you, who propagates your genes or who protects your territory. In humans who's needs are mostly met, it can be anything that generates love or loyalty. \n\nAnimals are complex, but their complexity is limited to a smaller number of motivations. In this way it seems that the outcomes are generally more predictable or... programmed.",

The buffalo gets up and definitely seems uncomfortable and tired but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s because of any severe wounds. It\u2019s tiring running from and getting nearly eaten by lions.\n\nLarge prey animals have an incredibly high tolerance for physical trauma. I remember in one of my med/surg classes being shown a picture of a horse with a massive chunk of flesh missing from the top of its neck, probably a foot long and going from the dorsal aspect of its spine with nothing remaining above it but its nuchal ligament.\n\nSpecifically here, there wasn\u2019t any damage to the buffalo\u2019s throat, which is where the major concern would be for damage to vessels capable of causing blood loss would occur. Yea there was a lion chewing on its abdomen, but like I said, I didn\u2019t see any blood on that lion\u2019s face, and without exteriorizing a lot of the GI tract, there really aren\u2019t any major vessels that superficially that would cause it to bleed out.\n\nBasically, to me this buffalo seems like it would be fine for a while. It might develop an infection that could kill it eventually, but I don\u2019t think blood loss will be what kills it.",
