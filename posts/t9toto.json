I think, generally, women are more afraid of violence, while men are much more likely to experience it, save a few very specific types of violence.\n\nWhere we diverged was where probability collapses into reality. Walking into 28 other men won\u2019t lead to 28 confrontations in most environments, but I believe will absolutely lead to more confrontations than women given equal circumstances.\n\nI think it\u2019s much less about who is running into people and really about who is being run into.

And apparently they're ostensible claim is that men never get out of their way and it's women that are expected to submit and move out of the way. Ok... \n\nAnd what about when men used to get out of the way and or open doors? The feminists seem to have a problem with that. So then we stop acquiescing to women and now they're pissed off about that. \n\nThey might be having fun with these little experiments and getting a win for their confirmation bias. But maybe they should be a little more direct with what they actually want? \n\nDo you want chivalry? Do you want men to acquiesce do you want men to move out of the way do you want men to open your doors? And if so what are you willing to do for men? \n\nIt seems to me men have just stopped fulfilling the expectations of women and they're pissed off about it. But they were pissed off when men were fulfilling the expectations of women. So whatever. every one of these situations is going to be nuanced also. Is it really just to pedestrians walking towards each other or is one carrying something or maybe one's pushing a baby carriage or maybe one has a limp or maybe one has a dog or maybe there's a pothole in the sidewalk or some mud that someone wants to avoid. \n\nBut if the idea is here that men are just bulldozers and we just plow through without concern for others... Okay so the women have decided they're going to do that too. And we have a bunch of accidents.\n\nI'm a truck driver, the smaller four wheelers usually get the hell out of my way.
