Abortion rights were stripped as the culmination of a decades-long organizational effort by a fanatical minority to explicitly subvert democracy. As we just saw in Kansas (a deep red state), if abortion rights were actually put up to a vote, they would likely be upheld. Most people already know where they stand on the issue, but even if we persuaded everyone who was still open to changing their mind, that wouldn\u2019t change the fact that said fanatical minority still holds the necessary power.\n\nProblem #2 is that, for the \u201ctrue believers\u201d who will remain opposed to abortion no matter what, it\u2019s not *just* about abortion, and it never has been. There is an entire constellation of interlocking beliefs, the most central, of course, being a belief in God, and the accompanying moral conviction of answering to a \u201chigher power.\u201d Among those is an opposition to contraception (because sex is for making babies) and opposition to anything beyond abstinence-only sex education (because premarital sex is sinful, and thus children don\u2019t need to learn about it), both of which are policies that would reduce abortions by reducing unwanted/unplanned pregnancies.\n\nIn summary, I think you\u2019re right that most people would be willing to work together on actually effective policies to reduce abortions, if that\u2019s something they care about. At the same time, we got to where we are *in spite of* that willingness, because a fanatical minority of people who are *unwilling* were able to seize the power to make those decisions.",

It's a nice tag line, who would be opposed to life?  Who would want to murder a child?\n> \n> But the simple fact of the matter is that the politics of the movement have, again, for decades, done nothing but cause more death, pain, and misery.\n> \n> Every single time that there has been a choice between supporting measures that would actually reduce the number of abortions, or instead supporting measures that would increase the number of abortions, they have chosen to support increasing the number of abortions.\n> \n> We can look at states like Colorado that have had major successes in improving the lives of everyone involved, while drastically cutting the number of abortions.  The policies work, they make sense, they are supported by the vast majority of experts in the field.\n> \n> It's straight forward stuff, like providing accurate, comprehensive, inclusive, sex ed in schools.  Like making birth control options available to everyone, and not requiring parental approval for someone old enough to be making other choices about their body to get it.\n> \n> This also has a number of other significant benefits, like increasing reporting of sexual abuse and reducing the incidents of sexual abuse.\n> \n> But the exact same people that have been claiming to be pro life, have also taken one look at that, and decided that no, they don't want to 'condone immoral behavior'.  They say that they see abortion as murder, and yet acknowledging that teenagers have sex every day is somehow just as bad?\n> \n> Waiting for people to be on their death bed to get care, even when everyone involved knows that there is exactly zero chance of a viable child ever being produced, and that the mother is almost guaranteed to die without care, is supposed to be pro life?\n> \n> And the exact same people, when it's a matter of an airborne disease that had already killed hundreds of thousands of people in this country alone, and which went on to kill so many more, abruptly screamed 'my body, my choice' about _wearing a mask_?\n> \n> This is supposed to be pro life?\n> \n> If this was about saving lives, they would have, at _any_ point, actually done something to try and actually save some.  Instead, they have taken steps that they _knew_ would result in more deaths.\n> \n> You can argue about when a group of cells becomes a person, you can argue about at what point it is _okay_ to force someone to risk their life for someone else, you can argue about innocence, but don't call those people pro life, because they have never shown the slightest sign of wanting to keep people alive.",
