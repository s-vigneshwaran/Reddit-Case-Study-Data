Their arguments about \"what makes a person\" is parallel to their arguments over what defines a \"woman\" or a \"man.\" They also generally conflate (and interchange) the terms \"person\" and \"human being\" (those two are not the same, but they never accept this fact).\n3. Their tacit refusal to acknowledge facts (surprise). Examples: the idea that \"abortion is murder\" is only 40yrs' old; that Conservative Justices have stated that Roe is \"settled law;\" etc.\n4. Like a trained monkey they have stock answers to the most common questions.  Here are some questions they uniformly can't answer:\n\n\\-How can you call a fetus a human being, when you can't tell the difference btw a human fetus, and a [dolphin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h11u-U_dcPI)??\n\n\\-You say you're against forced birth in the cases of rape, incest or the mother's life is threatened: yet what do you have to say about the 10yo in Ohio who had to travel to Indiana?? (their stock response...\"*oh, traveling to another state is no big deal\"*)\n\n\\-Isn't is strange that you're a dude (and almost all of them are) who feels comfortable dictating the health decisions for the majority of Americans?  What if a panel of women decided on when and where you got your prostate operations--is that okay with you?\n\n\\-If abortion is murder: then why are you fine with \"murder\" happening in states like CA and NY?  Isn't murder, \"murder\" no matter where it is?\n\n\\-And if you're good with outlawing abortion federally: you do understand that abortions are gonna happen whether you outlaw them or not, right? They're just going to be more dangerous for the mother.",

Go ahead and look up what democrat during Bush Sr was the middle of the road centrist giving conservative America what they desired. Hint: it rhymes with guidin'.\n\nThe orange fascist and his ilk are bad enough, we absolutely don't need to pretend the Democrats didn't have a role to play in the disaster we're in right now. Robert O Paxton's *The Anatomy of Fascism* is very clear about how fascism could not grow within a functioning democracy, but the persistent deadlock of government inaction had made people so outraged  they were courted by the headstrong get-it-done attitude of the strongman leader.\n\nDo not make any mistake, the likes of Manchin, Sinema, and several other Democrats over the years have contributed to the growth of fascism in America. This isn't a problem isolated to the republican party, even though they're being the most explicitly fashy.\n\nWe didn't get a blending if business and government just with conservatives. It's not only conservative media that feeds a sanitized perspective of events. Even NPR talked about the potential rail strike as if the worker's union was the party at fault.\n\nThe Dems are not that much better, and they need to pull their heads from their asses and drop that hubris.",
