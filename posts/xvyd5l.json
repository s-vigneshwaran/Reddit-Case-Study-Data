For counterclaims, you'll mostly state them in a responsive pleading, but in this case what I would do is move to dismiss and move to award attorneys' fees and costs for the frivolous suit against the plaintiff's attorney. \n\nSo in Alabama you would say the claim is without substantial justification, which is the catchall that includes frivolous claims, and move to dismiss and to award attorneys' fees either from the plaintiff or from the plaintiff's attorney(s) who filed the suit, as they should have known from the start that their claim was completely barred by law. Considering Good Samaritan laws are extremely common knowledge, this claim will probably work well against the attorney (and a court can actually *sua sponte* do this).",

If that person had actually been killed by the CPR perhaps? This system, although slow and often obtuse, does cover every single base and possibility. As long as both sides have good representation (as much as I hate insurance companies they usually ensure this) the facts will almost always be found and hopefully justice (or something like it) will be done. The system inherently must make rules for things which rules cannot be made. It must engage with obscure rulings and edge cases constantly, and for the most part I think it gets the job done.",

You simply \"called BS\" on the entire post, apparently unaware that in the US one might be sued even though doing things properly. (Whether the suit will be successful or not is immaterial.)\n\nIf that's never the case in the UK, you should be grateful that you are not faced with the sort of legal abuses we deal with here. I've heard it said that Americans are often guilty of assuming the rest of the world works under our rules; while I have no doubt that's a valid complaint, today I've seen the process reversed.",

Criminal negligence to the extent required to not be protected by a good Samaritan law basically requires you to have intentionally planned (with proof) that you were gonna go and attempt to kill somebody in the guise of giving them CPR, and even then it's a bit of a toss up on whether you would actually be found at fault.

I grant that. \n\nTl;Dr of it was that McDonald\u2019s had had many, many reports of dangerous serving temperatures and injuries, and had been highly negligent about their policy. The woman was very severely burned and McDonald\u2019s was found at fault. In all a very reasonable verdict given what the case revealed about the fact pattern of the problem. It was really reckless and negligent.",

Turn out, the injury damaged the nerves in her hand and she needed several surgeries to try to fix it.  She was an accountant and needed her hands for work and was unable to work for months.  She tried to make a claim with her health insurance but they said since this happened at someone house, she needed to make the claim with their home owner's insurance.  The home owner's insurance said that you have to sue your nephew, and if the court found the nephew responsible for the injury then they'll paid the bills.  So she had to sue her nephew, if she won, the home owner's insurance pays, if she lose, her health insurance pays.",

Most reasonable people wouldn't claim for injury damages when you saved their lives, but if faced with the potential that they wont get their medical expenses covered by insurance they can't not make the claim.\n\nThere is a case of a woman claiming on her insurance due to injuries received when her like 5 year old nephew tackled her to the ground with a surprise hug, and the clause required her to sue the 5 year old for damages before they would cover the medical expenses.

Like, thanks for wanting to help, but maybe don't screw with stuff you don't understand.  I guess I'm just saying that I think there needs to be some legal incentive for people to not render aid when there's no imminent threat they are trying to mitigate.\n\nThe crazy thing about this story for me is that trained EMT personnel often break ribs during CPR too; they taught me that in CPR class.  It's not at all like it is in the movies; CPR is incredibly violent and should only be used in specific circumstances because of the risk of injury to the patient.",

I was even going to say rocket scientist first because the point is that it doesn't need someone extremely educated or smart to deduce loss of consciousness + no breathing = you should probably have already started cpr.\n\n>I'm saying that their word at the scene would mean nothing in court if the other side brought a doctor as an expert witness who disagreed\n\nWell yeah that's obvious. An elevated opinion would trump that of a lower opinion. You just made it seem like the paramedics word meant nothing. A random civilians word would mean nothing.

Chest compressions aren't that successful in restoring circulation, it would have been far more statistically likely that they would have needed to continue CPR and begin ALS procedures if she was truly in a state of cardiac arrest.\n\n>OP is trained and had certification. \n\nWhich was expired. If just being trained once was the be all end all of CPR training, there would be no need for recertification. The reason you specifically recertify is because people tend to forget, especially things like, relevant to the scenario, properly ascertaining that the patient in fact needs CPR.\n\n>He likely relayed the relevant information on their state prior to administering aid as is expected. \n\nHe may or may not have relayed information, and what information he relayed was what within his competence to relay. That information was not fact, merely his opinion.\n\n>It is their opinion within their capacity. They are allowed to make that. \n\nThat is their opinion, but it is not within their capacity. That is why while they can declare someone dead, they cannot pronounce someone dead. Again, paramedics at the scene, even doctors at the scene cannot properly establish what was going on with the patient 10 minutes before. They cannot establish she was in cardiac arrest on any other basis than the testimony of witnesses. Which again we go back to the point that finding the pulse of a person or determining if they're breathing isn't 100% a given, especially in the case of a person like OP.\n\n>And the paramedics didn't just do nothing when they arrived. They just didn't continue cpr. I checked the op in r/legaladvice and nowhere does it say that.\n\nWhat did they do then? Since you checked the post, what specifically did they do? They did not continue CPR, OK, so did they inject medications, they defibrillated? \n\n>There's no judge in any district or country who would say he was being negligent.\n\nAnd I never said that, neither did the person I replied to, we merely speculated what the basis for the lawsuit may have been. Just as you can't skip sentences, you can't add them either. \n\nAgain, a) it's entirely possible that person with an expired CPR certificate, in the heat of the moment, failed to ascertain that a person didn't actually need CPR and b) the paramedics have zero factual basis for establishing that OP saved a person's life.",

Like I\u2019m the event you and someone else are doing drugs and one of you overdose, the police cannot arrest you for calling first responders and the family of the person who overdosed cannot sue you in the event the person dies or sustains serious injury. \n\nI believe most states have a protection from civil liability in the event you try to save someone. I believe some have Samaritan laws that prevent you from arrest and government prosecution but not civil liability. \n\nIt\u2019s sad because honestly if I lived in a state where I could be sued for trying to help someone I probably wouldn\u2019t risk the integrity of my household to save a stranger. I\u2019m not going to save your life and then give you the money Ive been saving for my childrens education. With the exception of the victim being a child I would just alert first responders. I\u2019d try to help with bleeding or comfort until they arrived but I wouldn\u2019t try to perform any procedures I have no experience in performing like cpr.",

The person you're performing it on almost certainly won't suddenly be revived if you \"succeed\" the point isn't to bring them back to conciseness (though it can happen) the point is that when performed properly it can hold back severe and permanent brain damage from single digit minutes, to double digit which can be the difference between life and death. The point is to keep these people breathing and the heart pumping blood untill paramedics arrive. That's why seemingly extreme force is so necessary\n\n3: again, it is ***NOT*** like the movies. Breaking ribs is extremely common and things tend to get very much bloody at times. So if possible you really might want a face shield if you plan on breathing as well as compressing (which despite recent online trends telling you that you don't have to breathe.. you really should. Compressions alone are better than nothing but compressions and breathing are even better)\n\n\nBonus fact for anyone who might not know. Defibrillators will not allow you to deliver a shock to someone unless necessary. And they aren't for restarting a stopped heart. They detect arrhythmia (erratic beating) and \"reset\" the heart back into a normal rhythm. But won't allow you to do so unless necessary. Also if I'm not mistaken all of the civilian ones will talk you through the process. And if you ever need one for whatever reason there are apps that will tell you where the closest one is. There's also again.. zero liability in using one due to its nature and how it works. So if you happen to need one and run across the street to a daycare or whatever that happens to have one. Unless someone is severely misinformed about it then they will almost certainly let you take it and go when needed\n\nEdit: bonus fact #2, if you ever find yourself administering cpr and you have the benefit of others around. Make sure you enlist a second person to switch out with on compressions. Because they are absolutely EXHAUSTING even for fit and trained professionals. And keep in mind that if you're the one who jumped in and started. You NEED to take leadership of the situation and tell people what to do and what you need. Don't ask, tell. \"You, I need you as backup for compressions. You, I need you to go to x location and get their defibrillator. You, call 911 right away\" etc for whatever you may need. People tend to freeze up and if you haven't.. congratulations this is now your scene and you are the boss until someone more competent takes over\n\nKeep in mind after reading. This information if you didn't already know it may very well save someone's life. So keep it just slightly above the meme memory banks please!",

I learnt the same things in my Basic Life Support training - EXCEPT we were told that it is no longer advised (in the UK at least) to do rescue breaths, just do compressions. This actually came in before covid, but not that much before, so a lot of people think it's a covid precaution but it isn't. I believe it's because in ADULTS the main cause of cardiac arrest is the heart so the main aim is to get the blood flowing. In CHILDREN however the main cause of cardiac arrest is something to do with lack of oxygen, which is why you do more frequent rescue breaths in children.\n\nIf I am wrong about this please just correct me and I will edit this post. It's been a while since I've done the training, the only thing I'm sure about is that the UK doesn't recommend rescue breaths in adults and that this isn't because of covid.",

This type of broken bone most commonly occurs in children because their bones are softer and more flexible than are the bones of adults.\n\nhttps://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/greenstick-fractures/symptoms-causes/syc-20351962\n\n\n> The osteoid density of a child's bone is less than an adult's. Juvenile bone is more porous than adult bone because the Haversian canals occupy a much greater part of the bone (Figure 4). This is the principal reason a child's bone can bend more than an adult's bones.\n\nhttps://www.rch.org.au/fracture-education/biomechanics/Biomechanical_differences_between_adult_and_child/",

But letting someone die in order to prevent injuries is not always desirable (DNR orders are another long discussion, but potential injuries sustained during CPR can be a factor in that decision.)\n\n>Also, how long would it take to usually heal?\n\nDepends a lot on the person and how healthy they are, but according to my expertise as a nurse working in a cardiac ICU and definitely not the google search I just did, they generally take one to two months to heal.",

I don't mean to say it's a tough call to make, but it *feels* tough to decide that this person is dead and you need to smash on their chest to get them alive again.\n\nI'm not trying to be lazy, but it would be difficult to give you a good answer with confidence that it's 100% correct and current. These links have good information:\n\nhttps://www.redcross.org/take-a-class/cpr/performing-cpr/hands-only-cpr\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/cpr.htm#\n\nI'm pretty sure the AHA is still recommending bystander CPR be done with just compressions, no rescue breathing. In short, if you see someone collapse or find them unresponsive, tap/shake, yell at them to make sure they're really unresponsive, and while doing this look at their chest for signs that they are breathing while feeling for a pulse on their carotid -- kind of jam you fingers between your adams apple and the big muscle on the side of your neck to feel where that is. If it's been about 10 seconds and you don't see/feel any of these, start doing compressions at a rate of about 100/minute, or the tempo of the Queen song \"Another one bites the dust.\" If you're wrong about them being unresponsive and without a heartbeat, pressing forcefully on someone's chest tends to do a good job of waking them up. :)\n\nThis doesn't include all of the information you should know, but I just wanted to attempt to give you a brief-as-possible answer in addition to links to more info.\n\nLastly...in the cardiac ICU, we 100% get people who are alive now who probably wouldn't be if family/freinds/other bystanders hadn't initiated CPR in a timely manner.",

But it is very common, especially in older people (who are more likely to need CPR in the first place) \n\nI personally don't like the \"you have to break ribs or it's not good CPR\" thing. For one it's not accurate, for two I'm worried it'll turn off bystanders from doing CPR.\n\nI remember a specific case of a guy in his late 20s who went into cardiac arrest secondary to respiratory arrest while we were putting him in the ambulance. I started CPR, and his sternum popped out of place, but I never felt any cracks, like I had with older patients. He may have gotten some hairline fractures though.\n\nAnother, less experienced EMT came to back us up, and he felt for a pulse and said he felt one, so I stopped CPR for a second and he said \"No its gone.\" it was there because of the CPR.\n\nWe actually ended up getting an update on him, which is somewhat rare. Within a few hours they moved him from the ER to the cardiac ICU, and the doctor complimented our work, which is even more rare.",

Even if your certification is out of date you should know that you should not perform CPR on a person who is breathing, so if that's what happened there could be something to the case.

This is definitely best and I let them know her case is frivolous.\"  or something vaguely like that.

I had more than $70,000 in medical bills, lost a kidney, etc. We did NOT want to cause his family any financial stress, but insurance was fucking us and the only way to get my bills paid was sue his insurance company. To do that, we had to sue him. We chose the max that insurance was supposed to cover without his family having to spend their own money, his insurance was supposed to provide a lawyer, but still we technically had to sue the poor kid for $100k just to barely cover everything. \n\nWe weren't allowed to contact them and his insurance fought tooth and nail to get out of paying (tried to blame my severed kidney on history of bulimia. Seriously. I was in the ICU for days, uninvolved doctors came by saying I was a miracle. But ofc it was my fault for puking as a kid) and when it was finally over, his girlfriend cussed me out when I reached out to him. It's a shitty system. Fuck insurance.",

It isn't sueing to go after the toddler. It's to just pay for ridiculous bills! It's honestly deceptive in favor of the insurance companies. Luckily, I would've been too compelling a victim to a jury for us to make it to court so we settled, but I'm sure the toddler's insurance company felt very secure that no one would blame a toddler... Even if that's not the real point.",

A defendant could admit to a homicide through some means like negligent discharge, but they are caught red handed, they didn\u2019t commit a murder. Negligent homicide is certainly not a murder. If the fact pattern presented by the prosecutor argues that it is a murder, and the defendant believes that they did commit homicide but they didn\u2019t mean to, the defense is there to protect the defendant by arguing that it was negligent homicide even with the confession. \n\nSince it is difficult to decide before the case is closed the circumstances of everything involved, I would say defending a confessed killer is ethical. And that when presented with the prima facie evidence presumably given by the litigant in the civil suit for injury here, I would say a sufficiently ethical lawyer would not accept this litigant\u2019s case.",

When it\u2019s abundantly clear that the defendant has indeed committed the crime they are on trial for before the verdict is given, then a defense lawyer\u2019s responsibility is making sure that correct due process is followed. For example, preventing the prosecution from misrepresenting facts to seek a harsher sentence than is justified. Or standing up to lazy/biased/incompetent judges, jury members, etc, that could result in an unjust verdict or sentence.\n\nSure, any lawyer who tries to get a Not Guilty verdict for somebody they clearly know to be guilty is a scumbag, but that\u2019s not a given.

I think having defense representation as a right of a US citizen is important whether or not you think you\u2019re going to successfully defend your case. There are a few reasons a defense attorney would take an unwinnable case. Maybe they are a rookie attorney and they need reps in court and practice litigating. Also defense attorneys keep police and the prosecution on their toes and forces them to do their work and not get complacent. It\u2019s also important for people to know that they can get defense if they need it. It puts faith in the government. We only complain about defense lawyers when the defendant is outwardly and presumably guilty.\n\nEdit: in this case it would be a lawyer for the plaintiff but I think my points still stand",

At that point, the other side would pay your attorney's bills and you'd only be left with the miserable experience of having gone through the process but no real bills to speak of.\n\nAnd yeah, not sticking around to identify yourself is definitely an option.

The best advice is if you can't afford it, don't try and pay it. It doesn't count against your credit, and usually it'll get written off or negotiated down. \n\n>Can the auto insurance say it wasn\u2019t part of the accident, and the hospital say it wasn\u2019t from their staff, leaving the injured to pay?\n\nYes, both things are possible.",

There are circumstances where you sue someone you don't want to sue because their insurance will end up paying for it, but it would be unusual to lose the lawsuit and then have insurance pay. Maybe if you had some kind of fancy umbrella policy? But seems unlikely.",

If it gets to the point where I have to give you CPR, it doesn't matter if I give you the worst CPR that anyone has ever given.

I'll also add that in the US at least there's a lot of careers that give CPR and first aid training. I had to learn it for trucking. So it's a very easily accessible set of things to learn, and no you're not going to be doing surgery out in the field. CPR/First-Aid is pretty basic in the grand scheme and is only meant to prolong the victims life until they can make it to a real professional in an equipped environment, which is usually EMT then the hospital.",

I only saw it happen one time where the patient was actively waking up during CPR, and after was completely lucid. They even remembered getting CPR and every time we'd stop they said they would start to black out until it was restarted. Luckily it was only about a 5 minute code as the first round of drugs got everything going the right way...  \n\n\nWithout terrifying everyone: codes are messy, they aren't like TV, and the aftermath is arguably more traumatizing. It will involve (in the vast majority of cases): a ventilator, a cooling machine (we cool people down to preserve brain function), likely at least 3-5 IV pumps of some kind, putting in a central IV catheter (if one wasn't present already), a urinary catheter, and maybe even a fecal collection device.  \n\n\nHave a long hard talk with your loved ones about the quality of life you want, and possibly write out a detailed living will and ensure that they will follow it. Also please be an organ donor, and make your wishes be known to your family about this as well. Many families overrule the organ donor card during a code because they think we won't try as hard. In the six states I've worked, it's done by a third party and doesn't change anything we do in that moment.",

In a scene where Buffy is performing CPR on her mom, you hear a loud pop/crunch  and she tells the 911 operator that she thinks she broke a rib. The operator tells her that's okay and to keep going. The only downside is that because Buffy is super strong, watchers could assume that it's because of her strength, not that it's normal, but I think the operator's response helped that somewhat. It's the only time I can think of where they actually show that, and I can still hear the sound it makes. It was a great episode; I was devastated the first time I saw it.",

You are trying to extend the time limit for brain/organ death by ensuring that *some* oxygenated blood is circulating through the body so that paramedics can arrive and apply more advanced techniques to further their chances of survival until they get to a hospital and receive care that could actually resolve the issue. CPR can save lives, but only in the sense that you are buying time as part of a long chain of cardiac care. It\u2019s not like the movies where it behaves like a revival spell in an RPG.\n\nPeople don\u2019t wake up and walk away from getting CPR. They *might* be able to do that with rescue breathing, but that\u2019s because their heart never stopped under that circumstance, they just had their breathing obstructed. Unfortunately, Hollywood loves to conflate the two procedures and the associated conditions, so a lot of people have a skewed understanding of what actually goes into caring for a victim under those circumstances.",

Spending a bit of the year in cold water conditions also drives home the idea of \"you're not dead until you're warm and dead.\" Not saying this is typical by any means, but a pretty amazing example of CPR actually working.",

January 18, 2009 in East Baghdad I had just showed up to an AID station with an LZ.  I had two critical and one walking wounded patients.  Their vehicle (an MRAP) was destroyed by an EFP.  The TC had his face blown off.  The gunner had a leg like a fettuccini noodle after it was boiled, and the driver had multiple in and out wounds singed by the hot copper.  Once we got them to the AID station, I was still in the \u201ctime is of the essence\u201d \u201cdo anything you can to save my friends\u201d mode.  The medivac choppers arrived, and there were two because my three patients had two different destinations.  Before my brother who was missing his face took off, Chaplain Banks walked into the chaos and put his hands on him and prayed.  The flight medic and I at the moment were equally annoyed by this delay.  I won\u2019t name him here because I wouldn\u2019t give the internet an opportunity to troll him but my brother died in the air.  It was a testament to him that he lived 45 minutes after point of contact with his injury.  After all was said and done, and after years out of the military, (years to think about every second and what could have been done) I wish I could thank Chaplain Banks today.  I don\u2019t understand God or man but I\u2019m thankful looking back at it now that someone took a moment to tell the universe we were losing someone who put his life on the line for others.  A warrior was leaving us before his time.  He died in flight en route to Camp Anaconda.  Was a hell of a man.  Wanted to get home to Arizona and start a family, be a firefighter so his future kids would still see him as doing for his fellow man.  I still hate myself for not keeping him with the living.  I\u2019d have traded places if I had that trick in my aid bag.  Fuck.",

For instance, someone like you is taught basic first aid and *basic* CPR. This is literally the bare minimum of knowledge needed to attempt life saving measures. It is what is taught to the general public and it is simplified so the lowest common denominator can do it. This is why, over the years, you've seen changes like the removal of rescue breaths from the BLS recommendations. Or the recommendation to forgo looking for a pulse. Rescue breaths and pulse checks are still recommended in more advanced life saving techniques. \n\nYou're trying to argue with a combat medic who has a **primary skill** of rapidly and reliably finding weak and thready pulses. The *vast* majority of BLS cert holders do not regularly need to find weak pulses. Taking a few seconds for a pulse check is **absolutely** better than not checking *if finding and assessing weak pulses is a skill you have*. \n\nSo you're right, they do not recommend that any more for **basic** life saving measures.You can take that course every 2 years for another 15 years and they still won't recommend you do it, because you're terrible at it. They won't recommend that you give rescue breaths either, because you're also terrible at those. They want you to jump on that chest immediately and don't stop compressions until someone with better training and tools arrives to actually save their life. And do you know who that person is going to be? It's going to be the combat medic, and he's going to check for a pulse.",

Technicalities like you may be a Paramedic for 2 decades and a trauma MD in ED at a hospital but because you didn\u2019t check for a pulse the regional variant of training fucks you because technically you were not compliant.\n\nIn short, you\u2019re both right. But regionally right for regionally different training.",

Out of hospital is significantly higher, all told it is around 30% - with some age groups being above 50% (pediatrics, young adults) - as most causes are trauma related.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe AHA has been doing a huge push to get the truth of the numbers out there, and I feel it's important to say: hands-only CPR saves lives, and know the Good Samaritan laws in your area. Even if you don't have a valve-mask or anything, there's enough reserve oxygen for about 3-5 minutes as long as you keep the blood pumping. So get EMS activated ASAP and then start CPR with chest compressions going at least 1.5-2 inches in depth, and you WILL feel ribs breaking or cracking.",

When they tell you every class that you\u2019re gonna break sternum/ribs, they fail to tell you that you\u2019re gonna feel it happen. The best point I ever heard made was, THEYRE DEAD. They\u2019re going to stay dead if you don\u2019t and probably even if you do but they\u2019ve at least got a chance if you do. Unfortunately, in this instance, he had no chance and I knew it (there was virtually no blood left to circulate). Wife was present, however, and trying to do CPR. I took over purely for the wife\u2019s benefit until the ambulance showed up. That\u2019s when having worked together so many times paid off. My EMT friend asked what I needed before grabbing any gear. (She knew the answer) I shook my head once and she pulled out her phone to call Dr to get permission to stop CPR. I gestured with my head towards wife and she whispered to her partner who walked around to the wife and gently stood her up and walked her out of sight. Wife left a message with my dispatcher about 6 months later thanking me. Said she knew he was gone before I arrived but had to know she tried everything. Thanked me for immediately doing CPR even tho we both knew he was gone. Best call I could have gotten. I\u2019m forever thankful that I did CPR even tho I knew I was doing it for the wife and not the pt.",

When cpr is done towards the bottom of the ribcage as was done for quite a while and is no longer reccomended, the ribs can break very easily, but when performed between the nipples, thus higher up on the chest it is much less likley to break ribs.\n\nKeep in mind that this is pretty fresh research, as i remember being taught the older method in first aid courses, and the first cpr course i took was at most 8 years ago",

The defendant would still have to hire a lawyer (or their insurance company would). You can then go to court and ask the judge to dismiss the case citing the law. Despite that, the judge could decide the facts are in dispute enough they don't and the case continues.\n\nThere are two complications though:\n\n1. Do the above still costs money you are unlikely to recover unless the law is well written. Lawyers don't work for free generally, and there is still your time and perhaps anguish.\n2. If your insurance company is handling it, they may decide a settlement is cheaper than #1 and force a settlement. Remember that if the insurance company hires lawyers to defend you, those lawyers are not your lawyers. They represent the insurance company, not you. They are not your friends and might very well lie to or mislead you. I speak from first-hand experience on this.\n\nOh, and if the case is #2 and you don't want to settle, then the insurance will abandon the case. Now you have to find another lawyer to take the case mid-case, and lawyers don't like to do that. The ones that might will charge more than if you went path #1 in the first-place. Any settlement or judgement then comes out of your pocket. The insurance won't pay. (At least in Texas)",

If a person is injured due to improper form or improper care and they were not trained to do care in the first place or do not have an active license to perform care, they *are* liable and are not protected by good Samaritan laws. Im an EMT in a Good Samaritan state, ive seen people fall under suit due to failed licensing more than once.",

Gross negligence would be like smashing their chest with a hammer or cutting them open to squeeze the heart or something.  \n\nIf you needed to be trained and licensed to perform emergency aid, then the entire point of a good samaritan law would be rendered moot.  And how on earth would you know the legal status of people that were at a scene that you later showed up to help at?  Medical Malpractice laws cover licensed physicians and the like, not the general public.  And good samaritan laws protect the general public. Having a CPR certification does not make you a licensed physician.  Heck, I had one from Boy Scouts and later a lifeguard class I took at the Y.  It's not a medical licensure.  You have actual lawyers in here disputing your claim...I'm going to take their word over yours, especially when every single thing I see regarding this issue agrees with them and not you.",

My point being thusly: You will not be protected by Good Samaritan laws if you try to go outside your area of training\u2014if you try to perform an impromptu tracheotomy to save a choking victim, for example, and you are not a trained surgeon. **You may also be held liable if your actions are seen to be reckless or negligent, or if you abandon the victim after offering initial assistance.**\n\nEmphasis mine, this last section is where this post falls into question. If CPR is performed wrongly and you KNOW you have an expired CPR card, you are considered outside your scope/area of training and thusly are giving care negligently.",

I think what we are getting hung up on here is that you probably have an exact definition of what a lawsuit is, while the rest of us lay people don't. I'm going to use the example of the guy who fell down the stairs, and telephone games aside, the facts are what they are. Liability was determines through some type of arbitration process, lawyers in expensive cars showed up at one point, never went to court. And everyone was talkig about a lawsuit  which was avoided by the arbitration process. This happens all the time and people refer to themselves as \"being sued\" \nI mean am I taking crazt pills? My whole life everyone was worried about getting sued, they dismantled the playground at my elementary school because  the school was always \"getting sued\" the town put no swimming signs up at the swimming hole because of liability, people are afraid to let people walk across their farm fields because of liability, but apparently that's just a myth?",

(although I have a hard time imagining how this one would be true - in fact it gives me a chuckle)\n\nToo many variables to know exactly how this did/should have played out",

I didn't do anything wrong and went above and beyond.\n\n The lawyers all told me not to take it personally and that basically once peoples insurance ran out from the associated medical bills and they had zero money, they'd find a lawyer and sue anyone and everyone in the situation and i was among several named.  It wasn't personal.\n\nA great mentor at the time was really helpful in this regard.  Told me it was a business decision on their part and that despite all the legal wranglings and bluster, that NOBODY wished I hadn't done what I did. There would be a lot of coulda, shoulda, and woulda and there would be accusations, but at the end of they day, that kid is alive because somebody somewhere did the right thing at the right time and knew how to do it.  That to get caught up in perfection of that is fucking ridiculous.\n\nSo the lawyers do their thing and you move on.  It will take longer then you think and you'll hear silence and then it springs back up again.  And you'll start to harbor resentment you even did it at all, but you have to hear that mentors voice in your head as a reminder.  You did the HUMAN thing and saved their life just as you'd want for you, but humans are humans and quickly forget and try to solve the NEXT biggest problem in their life (bills and injury, etc,) and they'll enlist people more than willing to help them solve that problem and take a nice healthy chunk for their  AUDI payments.\n\nOverall the worst long lasting thing is there is no joy or happiness at all in that whole thing.  I'll even forget until someone reminds me. \"remember when you saved that kid' and thankfully THEY remember the good parts and not the rest.  But you dismiss it because of the 18 months of bullshit that followed that you remember far more clearly.",

Generally, bystanders have no duty to aid another, but if you do administer aid, then you can\u2019t do so carelessly and if you do initiate care and that care causes other people not to help, but you then abandon the injured person, then that exposes you to liability for hurting the injured person\u2019s chances of survival/recovery. Generally, the Samaritan is protected unless he/she is grossly negligent or intentionally does harm to the injured person. All of this is why the Samaritan laws are so important, because without that protection, there would be a chilling effect on people helping others in jeopardy. \nIn terms of a civil suit, the plaintiff would have to prove damages. Generally, a broken rib would injury would demonstrate damages; however, since OP saved the plaintiff\u2019s life, I have to believe the court will weigh the life-saving resuscitation far more heavily than the incidental broken rib. OP will need to plead the Good Samaritan law as one of OP\u2019s affirmative defenses to the complaint. \nSorry you have to go through this, OP. You saved a life. Good on you.

However, CPR is within an EMR\u2019s (pretty much the first person on the scene) scope of practice. In addition CPR is supposed to compress the chest by a little over 2 inches, which will almost definitely break one or more ribs, especially in an older patient",

There's maybe a sorta 12-50 year old area where ribs are less likely to break, but people of that age generally don't go into cardiac arrest very often. Most people we end up doing CPR on are elderly and they're much more like to have more fragile bone structure. Kids ribs break easily too, their bones aren't as fragile but are much smaller and a grown adult doing compressions on them, even one handed, is usually enough to break some ribs.\n\nAbsolutely doesn't mean you're doing anything wrong and if you look at a CPR dummy (one that clicks when you do a full compression) it's actually surprising how deep you need to go. They say generally 1/3rd of the depth of the chest is enough, and if you look at your own chest now that's actually pretty deep. \n\nCPR is brutal. I've done it before where patients have ended up with blood shooting out of their mouth midway through, potentially due to the trauma to the chest. And if you ever see a LUCAS device in action its even more brutal.",

The paramedics might have said the person saved her life to reassure a traumatised first responder. \n\nIt could be argued that the first responder didn't properly check for signs of life before initiating CPR, as their training was too long ago.\n\nHowever the law above states \"appearing to suffer from cardiac arrest\", so hopefully it can be argued that the patient appeared to suffer from cardiac arrest to the first responder, and they will be unable to sue her.",

Really impossible to definitively answer without more information about what was going on but the fact the paramedics didn't continue CPR is a slightly bad sign for OOP.\n\nIt's possible they were just doing compressions on someone who was knocked out from  the crash but didn't need them.",

Likewise, this person will have have a fine time proving causation.

A broken rib is not enough for any plaintiff's lawyer (with the exception of some polyester-suited rookie) to take on the case. Motion to dismiss, possibly a motion for sanctions under rule 11 (or the Alabama equivalent) for bringing a meritless claim (i.e., bringing a suit that can't go anywhere in light of statutory immunity).",

This does not include people whose job requires them to provide aid, such as EMTs, doctors, firefighters, etc. All 50 states in the U.S have what we know as Good Samaritan laws to protect them from legal action. While the details of these laws can vary between states, they cover all cover three core premises. Volunteers are not liable as long as:\n\n* The care was provided as the result of an emergency.\n* The volunteer did not cause the emergency.\n* The volunteer acted in good faith, and did not deliver emergency care in a \u201cgrossly negligent or reckless manner.\u201d\n* There are caveats. Some states apply a concept of \u201cimminent peril\u201d which means that a volunteer may not be protected unless the victim they are helping is in immediate danger. The victim must also not reject giving aid. If they are unresponsive and cannot give consent to treatment, implied consent exists.\n\nSource: [AEDCPR](https://www.aedcpr.com/articles/can-i-really-be-sued-if-i-perform-cpr/)",

In this case, I assume auto and health insurances are involved and insurance absolutely LOVE to not pay. By accepting insurance payment, you \"subrogate\" the claim. That means the insurance company will pay, then they can go get the money from whoever they think should pay. \n\nIt's a good thing in theory. You get your medical bills paid by your OWN insurance so you don't go to collection. Then if it goes to court, your insurance company handles the delays.\n\nIt can be a BAD thing in practice when that insurance company goes after who their perceive caused the injury even if it's ludicrous. \n\nIn this particular case, I think OP is being named in a suit with other parties. It's a common practice to put all the parties in a civil lawsuit and let the court decide WHO should pay. Not doing that can result in an acquittal if they can convince the judge someone else might have caused the injuries and that person is not there to defend themselves. So in this case, I assume the victim's insurance is suing both the other driver and the good Samaritan to anyone who touched the victim will be in court. The judge can then say \"WTF, we have good Samaritan laws\" and dismiss OP's status as a defendant. That way, the car insurance company can be ordered to pay the damages.",

They said she was doing such a great job to carry on as that freed them up to stabilise him for the journey to hospital.\n\nHe survived then three months later filed an assault charge with the police as she cracked a rib during CPR. \n\nSo two detectives turn up at our house unannounced and want to interview her, I sit in on this taking notes. Obviously we were both angry and upset but then her employer suspends her because of this and basically says \u2018you\u2019re on your own\u2019.\n\nDetails go off to the CPR (Crown Prosecution Service) who have also asked the paramedics be interviewed as well and after 6 months the CPR come back with \u2018no case to answer\u2019, so she\u2019s in the clear.\n\nExcept that in those 6 months, she\u2019s been a wreck blaming herself going to hell and back with no pay in a job she\u2019s had for 15 years.\n\nFinally her company sends her a letter saying that she\u2019s now not suspended and they expect her back at work, no apology, no how have you been, etc, so she tells them to fuck off in no uncertain terms and the next day finds out she\u2019s pregnant with our first of three children, so is very happy.\n\nFunny thing was that she forced them to pay maternity as she hadn\u2019t officially resigned by letter and the way it worked with the three consecutive pregnancies this went on for a few years which they were less than happy with.\n\nSilver lining and all that.",

He saw me a few weeks later and he thanked me profusely and continues to donso every time he sees me.  That lady should be thanking you because about 98% of people that require cpr don't survive.  I am lucky because i have only had to do real cpr on 2 people and both of them survived.  The good samaritan act protects you from litigation as long as you don't act outside of your scope of training.  From what OP posted it doesn't appear that he did that so that lawsuit will probably be dismissed.  Congratulations on a job well done.  You should definitely take a bow because people who can perform high quality cpr are few and far between.",

You're not liable, but still, like bruh. You helped but like just remember that there's nothing stopping you from learning to recognize certain things if you're the type of person who wants to help people. \n\n\nTheir lawyer or that person is stupid though.

For petty nonsense, like this, that is more than enough and the cost is relatively cheap. Instead of $4k for retainer it\u2019s like $100 or so. Use this for most things.\n\nIn depth\u2026 Anyone can file a lawsuit for practically anything and file it in the wrong court entirely. The courts give very little care who they are taking a filing fee from. Asking for $10k where the court limit is $5k? Just pay the filing fee. Mad someone broke your rib saving your life? Just pay the filing fee. Had a bad date that you ruined? Just pay the filing fee. (This really has happened.)\n\nThat said, being sued is not always a dire crisis. In this case law will have it dismissed immediately. Other situations it can just be a matter of responding to the suit with the proper wording/point. For example if they exceed the amount allowed you just point that out and it\u2019s the wrong jurisdiction. Case dismissed. They then have to file again which is more money.\n\nA consultation with a lawyer will tell you if there is an ability to have immediate dismissal and/or best defense approach, but consults are billed on time, not questions, so you can ask other relevant questions. \u201cWhat if they file again in a higher court or within the limits of this court?\u201d \u201cWhat is the best possible way to defend against this?\u201d \u201cWhat records do I need to get and how would I do that?\u201d Etc.\n\nIf you\u2019ve got a case you think you\u2019re probably fucked on then hire the lawyer, they will limit the damage. If it\u2019s just stupid shit, get a consult, and work from there.",

CPR on its own is extremely unlikely to bring someone back from cardiac arrest, you need medications and you need defibrillation. All CPR does is keep oxygenated blood moving through the body and keep tissues from dying to buy you time to administer those interventions that actually get the heart beating again. The only reason that the paramedics wouldn't continue CPR is that they found the patient had a pulse, and if she had a pulse it is overwhelmingly likely that she had a pulse when OP started and CPR shouldn't have been done in the first place.\n\nIf the OP was doing CPR on someone who didn't need CPR and clearly wasn't in cardiac arrest, the paramedics showed up and said \"Good job you saved her life\" but in reality all OP did was give CPR to someone who didn't need CPR, Good Samaritan laws might not really apply...\n\nYou could argue that OP was acting in good faith to help someone, and that might be enough to dismiss the case, but if that's what happened I think the patient also has cause to be a little bit upset",

The risks, the diseases that can be spread if you don't protect yourself (years pre-covid, even then for CPR it required mouth to mouth protection, gloves etc) of course in the heat of the moment and adrenalin most people forget all of these things. But it was drummed into us that WE could pass on unknown things also to a victim in an accident.\nWe were trained to help, but often that can be such a huge ask and risk. Like if you begin CPR and get tired and there's noone else to help (yes it does happen!) then your attempt can be futile. And even worse, if you begin CPR and everyone standing around is too busy capturing it on their phone and noone wants to help you, you have noone to clear the scene and everyone filming you for attention (this was sadly the biggest lesson 5+yrs ago. The people who will film for the attention, but won't help to potentially save a life, or help just to clear off the crowd for some breathing room)",

Consider at least doing chest compressions as that avoids most of the risks from diseases.\n\n> Like if you begin CPR and get tired and there's noone else to help (yes it does happen!) then your attempt can be futile\n\nSomeone needs to start. Maybe someone else shows up later to help you. Personally I think this is isn't a great reason not to help. Maybe others aren't quite sure they remember everything right but with someone else taking the lead they would help you.   \n\nA paramedic I talked about people filming said that he had to grab and throw peoples phones in the forest to get them to stop filming.",

They hauled him off.  The Dr never came out of his office during the 10 minute ordeal.  I went back to his office to ask him why he didn't help, and he told me that if he had helped that guy, then he would have had to go with him to the hospital, and he wasn't going to risk missing out on any money that day.  \ud83d\ude33",

If its been more than a few years since med school, and now they are in family medicine they are worthless in an emergency.  In the USA there is something like 27 different specialities for them to go into.  And unless they go into Emergency Medicine (to work in the ER), ICU level doctors and so forth they are worthless in an emergency. \n\nSo instead of just calling for help, you went to a office for a Doctor that hasn't seen an emergency in years, maybe decades.  Thats not his realm.\n\nI've been working in EMS for over a decade.  I one time went on a call with a patient that just had a seizure in a public place (not violating any HIPAA right now because I haven't even described one thing about the patient).  Get there and there is a Dermatologist performing CPR on this person, but the patient is in a postictal state due to the seizure and this doctor is, performing CPR on a living person.  So I had to stop her and push her away so I could treat the patient.  Well thanks to the CPR, that wasn't needed, the patient now needs chest x-rays at the hospital. \n\nWhere I live would the Doctor need to go to the hospital with the ambulance, no, they are able to assist and pass off care.  But there might be areas where it is required. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nit's not about the doctor not making today.  It's about her/him wrapped up in an emergency when they don't know anything about emergency medicine. \n\nFurther, it's like going to a doctors apportionment for something and the doctor looks at you and says \"hmmm, I am going to refer you to a specialist\".    27 types of medical doctors dude, they normally are only good in their specialty.  Maybe fresh out of med school they can handle an emergency, but that fades away.",

If you're not an actively licensed and insured medical professional, you are permitted to give any reasonable care you feel capable of doing. \n\n\nOP previously got certified for CPR but let the certification lapse, which means they're not actively working in the medical field. No malpractice insurance to collect a payout from. CPR isn't the sort of thing they change from year to year, so learning it once is fine if you're not regularly performing it. On top of that, the lawsuit is over a rib being broken during CPR; I'm not certified but I'm the only member of my extended family that isn't, I know broken ribs are super common in CPR and sometimes it's the only proof that CPR was done correctly.",

In an entirely different situation. For the hundredth time. I would believe it the same as I believed your first link. It's irrelevance to something like this, as explained so many times now, is where my objections lie. But it's very clear you aren't terribly concerned with actuality paying attention to replies.\n\nThat's a cute attempt, but no. If I were still spewing irrelevant bs from 2004 or before it would be different of course, but unlike old articles about irrelevant judgement humans don't stay mentally stagnant over time.

Medics on scene did not take over/continue C.P.R which is odd unless the patient\n A: did not need it \nB: Drowning victim cleared\n C: is dead.\n\nIt's not like on T.V. people recieving compression C.P.R. alone rarely pop into sinus rhythm without AED assistance. \n\nEven so... Good Samaritan law should cover so long as O.P. is not a medical professional. \n\nIs  there more to this story?",

There\u2019s only a few circumstances where first responders would arrive and not continue CPR at all such as if there was a DNR form, the patient wasn\u2019t actually in cardiac arrest, obvious signs of death like rigor mortis, or return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC).\n\nOP makes it kind of vague but we know the patient survived and I can only think of foreign body aspiration or choking that would cause an arrest that had ROSC with CPR only. \n\nThe standard ACLS protocol is to either defibrillate or provide epinephrine or both depending on the rhythm analysis. Without knowing that it\u2019s hard to figure out what happened. \n\nThat being said we don\u2019t expect layperson to be able to figure that out so that\u2019s why Good Samaritan laws exist. \n\n\nSource: CPR/EMT instructor, medical student",

So, Arizona specifically carved out an exemption to this for medical professionals who are volunteering at amateur sporting events- that is, they're licensed professionals who are the \"official doctors\" on the scene, but aren't being paid, are protected under the law.",

They tried to sue the rescuer, and it was rejected. \n\nAmerica, sort your shit out.",

It caused her *third degree burns* which resulted in two years of treatment including skin grafts.

She removed the lid to add cream and sugar and spilled it on herself.\n\nShe initially just asked Mcdonalds to pay $20K for her medical bills, lost time at work, etc...

Unless the person was literally performing CPR on a person who did not require it (they weren\u2019t unconscious, had a pulse) they couldn\u2019t be sued. Also CPR didn\u2019t continue when paramedics arrived?! The person would be dead in that case, ROSC doesn\u2019t just happen like that. \n\nIf this story is true in any capacity the person would deserve to be sued for gross negligence, you don\u2019t give CPR to someone who doesn\u2019t require it, that\u2019s assaulting someone. CPR is meant to manually \u201cpump\u201d the heart - if the heart is beating then you wouldn\u2019t do it. \n\nPeople are so hungry for things that make them pissed off they just immediately jump onto these things. Simple story with a bad guy and a good guy who is being punished for trying to help - reddit shoots it to the top of the popular page without any questioning.",

If that\u2019s the case, he has a professional obligation to tell his client, the insurance company, that this is frivolous.\n\nIf the State Bar finds he DID file a frivolous suit, then they will rightly discipline him.\n\nTrue story:  A year or two back there was a Texas State rep (who was a lawyer), obviously a Repub, who tweeted a threat at Beto Orourk about taking guns away.  (Brisco Cain \u201cMy AR15 is ready for you\u201d)\n\nI have no relationship with either, and don\u2019t even live in Texas, but I filed a complaint online against him saying it was a violation of the Texas State Bar\u2019s Code of Conduct, for a lawyer to threaten violence against a politician.  Took me all of 5 minutes.\n\nThe State Bar opened an investigation, as they are required to, he had to talk with them and go thru the whole hassle of defending himself.  Not surprisingly, that being Texas, they found \u201cno issue\u201d (?WTF?) and sent me a letter informing me of that, AND ALLOWING ME TO APPEAL the decision!\n\nI checked 1 box on the form, Appeal, stamped it, and mailed it back,   Took me 1 minute.  He had to go thru the whole process again!  Serves him right.",

Alleging a frivolous lawsuit is an allegation of objective fact and is defamatory if untrue. A frivolous lawsuit is not one where the party has an affirmative defense, it\u2019s one that has no legal basis and is rooted in malice. This has a legal basis, even if it\u2019s a losing case. It\u2019s also not done out of malice. And this is what insurance is and what it does. It is literally the service you are paying for. Your contract says that you give them permission to pursue all plausible claims against any party contributing to the injury. The OP would have a valid affirmative defense, and it would get dismissed and their fees will either be awarded by the rules of the forum or they can counter for that amount. At worst, they\u2019re out one day of work. It\u2019s a shitty system, but this is not an egregious or unusual thing in the context of it. Ending privatized healthcare would lower medical bills to the point where there is no financial incentive to pursue all plausible claims in most cases.",

It\u2019s not defamatory as there is no public statement.  Appealing to the  Bar\u2019s QA process, by definition, is not defamatory, it\u2019s simply saying, hey, this may not be right, please evaluate.\n\nI would be astounded if the Bar\u2019s QA process permits retaliatory responses.",

I do have a long career in emergency medicine, ambulance and pre-hospital critical care do I can add insight into the value of CPR in situations like this (although the details are vague here).\nWhen you say \"crash victim\" I'm guessing you mean a person who was involved in a motor vehicle accident. Whether this be a passenger or a pedestrian I'm also assuming that you figured they were critically injured and/or in cardiac arrest.\nThe tricky thing is, a person who is cardiac arrest secondary to trauma is (almost) unequivocally dead. There are very very few specialised interventions which can turn a traumatic cardiac arrest around and chest compressions are unfortunately not one of them. The fact that paramedics didn't continue the compressions is also probably a good indication that they were not the right thing to do.\nDoes Alabama's good Samaritan by-law protect someone who did the wrong thing, but with good intentions? I'm sure there must be a line in the sand somewhere. \nUnfortunately there will be legal precedents in which someone jumped into life-saving mode where their actions have made the outcome worse.\n\nGotta be honest with you though, if someone was trying to save my life with the best of intentions and I walked away with a crack rib? I'd still send em flowers and a bottle of scotch to say thanks.\n\nWtf is wrong with people?",

I worked on a kid (outside of work) and his mom thanked me for saving him by threatening to sue me for, you guessed it, breaking his ribs. Well done/effective CPR *frequently* results in broken ribs, so frequently that it\u2019s gone over in the certification class and said to be *expected*. CPR is brutal, but when you\u2019re literally dead it\u2019s better than staying that way. Anyone can sue for whatever they\u2019d like, but any lawyer worth their grit will tell the lady they\u2019re lacking any reasonable cause and if it did make it to court, they\u2019d almost certainly be laughed out of there in almost any case. The good sam law is in place for this very reason. I went on to be an ocean lifeguard, a firefighter, an EMT and then a medic for most of a decade and broke plenty of ribs in that decade. It\u2019s part of the process. People are so money hungry and ridiculous, but luckily this kid almost assuredly has absolutely nothing to worry about, expired certification or not.",

And everyone started hating on the woman until the family was like \u201cher insurance won\u2019t cover the bills unless she goes to court\u201d and it was some weird law that required her to. Obviously the nephew was not found liable, but it\u2019s insane a child still had to be sued before insurance covered the medical bills\n\n\nEdit: found exactly what I was thinking of.

He gets a few ribs broken every year, and knows exactly at which point he has to stop them because he (unlike the future patients needing it) has a functioning heart and CPR is actually interfering with its function.",

I don\u2019t know if that means legally liable but the higher the training, the more that\u2019s going to look like a mistake. \nIf however their heart stopped because of their low blood sugar, you administered CPR, their heart restarted, and medics arrived and administered medication\u2026..you saved their life and we are in \u201cgood CPR causes broken ribs, you\u2019re welcome\u201d territory. \nJust too many variables that we don\u2019t know.

CPR doesn\u2019t directly save lives, electricity does. So it is most likely a AED was needed to put the persons heart back into a perfusing rhythm and it sounds like they didn\u2019t have one and the paramedics didn\u2019t continue cpr so I almost wonder if the person was just unconscious and the person didn\u2019t properly check for a pulse or the person had a very weak pulse so actually negligently broke her ribs. the medics may have just said you saved her life to be nice. It\u2019s still messed up that he\u2019s being sued, it sounds like his heart was in the right place.",

To call her being  ungrateful would be a huge understatement. \n\nI\u2019ll admit, reading all of this does bring back some unpleasant memories of mine. Four years ago, my dad, before he passed, I remember finding him slumped over on our couch hearing my mom crying and calling 911. I immediately rushed over to perform CPR on him until paramedics arrived. I actually had to learn it two years prior so I could receive my personal trainer certification. \n\nAnd although I felt fortunate to be trained in knowing how to administer a life saving technique, it still wasn\u2019t enough to save his life. These last four years I\u2019ve been wondering if I even did the whole procedure right. The reason why I say that is because I felt so bad for breaking/cracking one of his ribs at the time and have even blamed myself here and there thinking I didn\u2019t do enough. Or that I didn\u2019t do any of it right and therefore I might\u2019ve ended up making it worse and killing him instead. \n\nBut, I remember my CPR instructor telling me \u201ca broken rib is better than being dead.\u201d My dad also had ischemic heart disease, emphysema and was quite underweight too so I don\u2019t think he gave me or the paramedics much to work with either in terms of trying to revive him. \n\nBetween reading the comments on here and remembering my mom telling me that the paramedics were able to get a heartbeat shortly after I stopped so I could made way for them to do their jobs, I feel like I may have done more things right than wrong. And having that closure makes me feel like I can finally rest easy now.",

A truck passing by, that happened to also contain sewage, put the truck out with whatever they had. Well.... What they had was just that.... sewage water and it enabled them to put the fire out long enough to get him pulled out. 2 years 3 months later he sued the driver of the truck. \"Datsun septic cleaners\" to be exact. It's still ongoing and I'll never be able to understand how this person can look at themselves in the mirror every single day.",

I have done CPR 4 times and you cam feel the cartilage popping during compressions.\n\nSince it is a \"crash victim\" there is trauma already - I guess they would need to prove that the compressions themselves caused the break?",

It was summer in GA and it was hot and humid as hell here. I was talking to one of the men and about 45 minutes later, he came in to use the bathroom. For some reason, I came into the room right next to the bathroom and I heard what sounded like someone collapse and hit the porcelain toilet. My mom and I banged on the door, no answer. Door was locked, so we grabbed the key on top of the door and found the man unresponsive. My mom did begin doing CPR, because we were in shock. By the time the paramedics got there, he had already passed. \n\nMy dad was extremely angry and worried about being sued. \n\nBut what else could we have done? My mom and I were both certified in CPR, so are we supposed to think he has no chance? Luckily, everything turned out okay and the man\u2019s wife and daughter\u2019s asked if they could come see where he had passed. \n\nHopefully, everything will work out for you OP. \n\nBest of luck to you and thank for being a good human.",

Secondly saying that CPR didn't continue when the paramedics arrived is another concern. Getting return of output is extremely unlikely without using a defibrillator as you tend to move from non shockable to shockable rhythms in turn. This sounds like a fabrication or a person has tried to help someone by giving CPR when it wasn't needed.",

Some of those lawsuits will be against people or parties that have defenses that admit that they contributed to causing financial damages, but still mean they aren\u2019t responsible for paying for the damages. Once those lawsuits are dismissed, the cases against parties who don\u2019t have defenses and are liable proceed to a settlement or a trial. If the money they recover from those people and parties isn\u2019t enough to cover your bills, your insurance then pays the rest up to the dollar amount of your coverage and sometimes even more than that. Is that a better explanation? I\u2019m trying to get better at explaining these concepts.",

An attempted trach would be a case by case basis depending on the circumstance and whether or not it was necessary.  Successful life saving procedures are almost always covered, but it would probably need to be adjudicated in more extreme examples.",
