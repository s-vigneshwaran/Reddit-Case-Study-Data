There was a art piece made by a man that was crazy big boobs and big butt it was meant to be about how society views women. But everyone hated it cause it was made by a man and his sexist view on women. and one of my friends who was still a feminist but not as bad as the rest said\u2026 umm I don\u2019t see the problem in it, if a girl made this itd be seen as empowering so why is it bad when he does it? Especially his message could be the same or meant to be empowering. Lol my professor went silent and no one even tried to argue it. It\u2019s exactly what I wanted to say but knew as a guy if I said it I\u2019d be hated on and told I was sexist misogynistic",
