Who the fuck wasn't cringe af when they were 18. Your 20's are entirely about failing and growing to see why your cringe is cringe. Take care of yourself by being realistic and present with today.

It doesn't matter that you're 18 years old living in your parents basement. You could be 40 doing the same. Age doesn't matter. What matters is that you have a dream and are working to achieve it. How many times did Edison fail? Or Franklin? In the end no one remembers that. Believe in yourself. I do have to say though, you're young and you should go to college and get a good education. Those classes, the people, environment will really push you and challenge you to even your breaking point and you will become an even better problem solver than you are now and that will inform your abilities in tech and make you a better founder. When you're young you can invest that time and make the commitment for school. As you get older and have more weight of responsibility placed on you, it gets harder. So please consider going to school, get your education, and come back to finishing your start up. Give yourself options. And always believe in yourself along the way.",
