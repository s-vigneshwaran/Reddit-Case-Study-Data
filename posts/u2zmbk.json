  "text": "TIFU by learning that my favorite cup - the cup that I use every day to drink my morning tea - is causing me brain damage\nToday while scrolling through my Twitter feed and minding my own business, I learned that there was a study recently that the 1987 Garfield mugs series from McDonald's titled \"It's not a pretty life but somebody has to live it\" has been tested to and now is verified to have over 99,300 PPM of Lead and 5,833 PPM of Cadmium which are both to cause brain damage and/or potential cancers.\n\nThis is my favorite mug -- I am a massive Garfield fan -- and I use it every day in the morning to make my morning tea as well as to have at my desk when I stream and record/edit videos. My favorite fat cat and a hyperfixation since I was young has been killing me, one sip at a time and ironically to add to the meat of this, my name is John.\n\nGARFIEEEELD!\n\n  \n\n\n TL;DR but today I learned that Garfield, the fat orange cat, is giving me brain damage and potentially even cancer.  \n\n\n\\[[Link to Lead-Testing Article](https://tamararubin.com/2019/10/1978-garfield-its-not-a-pretty-life-but-somebody-has-to-live-it-glass-mcdonalds-mug-99300-ppm-lead-causes-brain-damage-5833-ppm-cadmium-causes-cancer/)\\]\n\n\\[[Picture of me showing off and brandishing my super cool Garfield mug in astonishment and bewilderment](https://twitter.com/laterment/status/1514336685223514123?s=20&t=W_U_GpIylQMDDGEIUxJXVQ)\\]\n\n\nEdit: (additional text and information)\nI\u2019m not sure why this post blew up the way it did but seven hours and a million views later, I have found out there are *MANY* Garfield cup owners, users, and enjoyers and I want to say thank you for checking out this post \u2014 I appreciate all of you!\n\nWhen I made this post, I wasn\u2019t expecting it to get to where it is at but if you have a Garfie cup like me, you\u2019re probably safe as long as you\u2019re not licking the damn paint haha \u2014 don\u2019t lick the paint and make sure your print it still laminated/sealed!\n\nUse the cup at your own disposal for whatever you please and keep doing what you do, you wonderful people :)\n\nI\u2019m planning on making a YouTube video about this situation and the cups in a week or so thanks to you all and I really do hope you enjoy \u2014 I\u2019ll still be in the thread chatting but it\u2019s been an adventure!",

The physics of X-Ray Fluorescence are based on the characteristic spectra of elements, not molecules. That is, chlorine gas is poisonous and sodium explodes upon contact with water, but together it makes table salt. This is taught in basic undergraduate chemistry, and this website\u2019s lack of mentioning molecular knowledge is discrediting. Furthermore, if there was a thin laminate layer above the paint that prevented any actual contact, or porosity to the paint, but was transparent to the spectra, an XRF would detect the paint even though there\u2019s no way to ingest it.\n\nThis laminate could be soda lime glaze.",

The FDA knows.\n\n\"Traditional pottery and other forms of ceramicware are made with earthenware, a porous form of clay which must be glazed in order for the pottery to hold food or liquid. Glazing applies and fuses a thin, glass-like coating onto the surface of the clay to seal its pores. The glaze \u2013 which may contain lead to facilitate the melting of glaze particles \u2013 fuses to the pottery when it is fired in a kiln, a special oven used to bake clay. When the pottery is fired at the proper temperature for the proper amount of time, essentially all the lead is bound into the glaze. If any migrates to food, it will be an insignificant amount. However, if not properly fired, the lead may not fuse to the earthenware and may contaminate food when the pottery is used with food.\"\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/food/laboratory-methods-food/elemental-analysis-manual-eam-food-and-related-products\n\nYou also picked a very specific example with the dishwasher. In that if the paint flaked off, it is inside a sealed box with a mechanism to spray water and detergent, suspending the particle in fluid continuum that is mechanically drained without the intervention of human hands, making it highly unlikely to be ingested by humans that are not sucking down on the drainage pipe of said dishwasher.\n\n\nLead poisoned children \u2260 chemistry Ph.D., just like how one's late grandparent who passed from cancer does not make one an oncologist. Now there's nothing wrong with informed advocacy, based on accurate technical education and relevant analysis, but this author is not doing that, rather waving around context less gigantic numbers to create panic with no connection to actual use cases. On top of that, she has a banner on the page to affiliate marketing links.\n\nAny truly scientific explanation would certainly quantify the amount of exposure in some way, in qppropriate units of mass, time, etc. This author uses PPM, which is a measure of concentration in fluids, on solids & surfaces.

I\u2019m a potter, and the majority of the designs that mass produced mugs have are all screen printed, ceramic or glass. If it does use underglazing or glazed designs, typically yes, it is sealed under clear glaze or is vitrified itself so it essentially becomes fused glass with the ware. But that in itself is a whole other can of worms- People mixing food safe glazes willy nilly to get interesting glaze color combos can alter the chemistry as such that it does leach in an unsafe way. Many potters do leach tests to be sure the ware they make is safe, or they glaze the inside with a definitely safe glaze and go to town on the exterior with the more dramatic glazes. A lot of the glazes in our studio are definitely not food safe, you definitely don\u2019t want to be drinking coffee out of something barium glazed. There are numerous newspaper reports on people getting lead poisoned drinking from pottery made in Mexico. As for the lead poisoned kids, the majority of them are poisoned through water (portland, Oregon definitely has this problem with old lead soldered pipes and a slightly acidic water source which only exacerbates the problem), and flaking old leaded paint which they end up inhaling. They ask about this on my toddler\u2019s pediatric questionnaire, questions like \u2018was the house built before xyz date, and has your home been recently renovated\u2019.  When a parent has lead poisoned kids, I can understand them wanting to get rid of *everything* that could be a possible source of lead.",

The difference is in the manufacturing process, though they have similarities. Glass has to be heated to a molten state to be able to be manipulated into shapes, and as I mentioned, any sort of detailed graphics will just melt and blacken. So, you can\u2019t have a layer of glass sealing in a graphic, it isn\u2019t like resin where you can encapsulate graphics like that. The same goes with ceramics which is also heated to way beyond what ink can handle before it burns up completely. So that is the only similarity - I only pointed out that you can\u2019t bring in the fda\u2019s definition of lead glazes/glass being encapsulated safely underneath a glassy surface because the garfield cups are made by screen printing ink on the surface. Their definition is also a bit broad, because there are numerous ways of surface decorating pottery that they don\u2019t touch on. There are enamel paints that are low fired, as well as surface lustres like real gold and lustre. These two types of surface decoration are definitely not covered in glaze. But my main point was it doesn\u2019t even matter that the cup is made of glass, it could be plastic, or fabric or wood - the lead that the author is concerned about is in the screen printing ink itself. From there I don\u2019t know how one gets lead poisoned but the lead testing author\u2019s take on that is from wear and tear (any microscopic amount of lead is not good for very young kids). But it would probably help her point if there were more scientific studies done. Most of the science for lead poisoning is in flaking lead paint in old houses, soil contamination from said paint and leaded gas, and in contaminated water. She\u2019s getting into the gray areas where there is little research but they are plausible sources for lead poisoning. One example of her work was a family that eliminated all sources of lead but their kids were still testing at 4 (you want to be below 2, which meant they were still exposed). The author did an at home consultation with her XRF gun and it turns out it was the vintage family table they were eating at every day that had lead in the wood stain, and the kids were ingesting the lead in the stain. Even the lead inspector they hired missed that.",

From a legal standpoint, the reading provided in the article would never hold up. Someone else commented on the thread asking about class action lawsuit (maybe jokingly), and this type of reading would never be included in something like that because it cannot be guaranteed accurate and precise. Only methods strictly followed by EPA or state approved guidelines. MAYBE the tester followed those guidelines, but there is no mention of it, and every single report I provided to state and federal agencies had very long detailed reports on the accuracy, precision, quality assurance/control of the data and procedures to collect the data so if they legitimately tested it, it's very odd they didn't note it because any scientist, engineer, lawyer, or regulator would immediately ask for it.",

The body is fairly resilient and while Cadmium and Lead have well-established toxicological profiles, an occasional exposure in minute quantities is probably not going to lead to observed adverse effects. Everyone has lead in them, and this gets stored / gradually released over their lifetime. The fact is that most of ingested lead will be cleared by the body over the course of about a month or so. Yes, higher circulating levels will lead to higher levels of deposition, but drinking from a mug containing (likely) inorganic lead in its paint isn't going to be the substantial contributor to this.\nWalking around downtown for an afternoon will probably be a higher exposure of both lead and cadmium than drinking out of this mug, considering you are being exposed to ultrafine particulates composed of a bunch of different metals and incomplete combustion products... and that is through inhalation, which makes it a lot easier for these types of compounds to be absorbed into the blood stream.",

In the case of cars today, the major component of that would probably be incomplete combustion products (I\u2019d have to check that, but hydrocarbons like PAHs are a known byproduct here). But cars always have tire wear and they use brakes to stop. When you have washed your car, ever see that nasty gunk coming out of the wheel wells? That is the brake dust and it gets kicked up into the air. As a result of wear on both of these parts of the car, this stuff gets released into the air and eventually settles, but then gets kicked up again, etc. these dusts have a variety of compounds / metals based on their composition.\n\nWould one car be a problem? Probably not. But what about several cars constantly? It\u2019s one of those things where an occasional exposure is probably fine, but for people living in crowded cities\u2026 they never get away from that.\n\nThere have been some pretty interesting studies coming out looking at ultrafine particulate exposures and walking along the sidewalk of busy streets. \n\nIt\u2019s not a dumb question at all, if anything you really thought out the process. It has been awhile since I have looked at this type of data so I wish I could be a bit more specific; unfortunately my knowledge is really in the molecular mechanisms of specific industrial compounds containing metals, so these are knowledge bits I \u201cpicked up along the way\u201d. I can look around for articles for you though if you\u2019d like more information.",

He wants to eat lasagna. He wants to *sometimes* make Jon happy. He has desires and even if we don\u2019t all see them, goals. He has a reason to exist just like we all do.\n\nFor me, in a very dark time in my life when I was going through depression in my teenage years, I would go to bed every night with The Garfield Show playing in the background as I\u2019d fall asleep - it was something that I never understood but recently, I\u2019ve been going through therapy and have come across the fact that I used to fall asleep with my dad watching it when he would come home from work, all beaten up and tired from making ends meet \u2014 that was the time we had together, it was something special and it made me happy.\n\nGarfield has not only been a genuine comfort to me, but has been a joy.\n\nThe fat orange cat has been my happiness in a time of desolation and has made even my hardest nights a little bit easier.\n\nI love Garfield and even if you don\u2019t, that\u2019s okay.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to love him, but he makes many people happy for just being himself :)",

Whenever we made something that was designed for food, we had 2, maybe 3 glaze options that were food safe. May have been clear, white, and an off white. Point is, almost every glaze that has color is made with heavy metals. I personally like to buy handmade ceramic mugs from different places as I am a huge coffee drinker. However, I wouldn't trust any mug or dish that has a deep blue, green or or any color glaze where the food surface would be, especially something acidic like coffee.",

One major component of tea is tannic acid, a very complex acid that likely would catch any metals (lead, cadmium) and render them impossible to be absorbed by the gut.  \n\nDon't take my word for this.  I'm speaking as a chemist and have no expertise on the absorption of materials from the gut.  However I'd bet better than even money that most metals pickled from that mug by tea would not be absorbed.\n\nThe situation would be quite different, for example, if you'd used it for some mono-acid, like vinegar, as that would produce a salt that likely would be absorbable.\n\nEven citrus juice is largely citric acid, which likely would complex the metals and *might* make them unabosorbable.  Again, not my expertise.  I'm working from chemistry and conjecture.\n\nBut DO discontinue use of this mug.  As a general rule, be wary of any brightly colored ceramics, as those glazes likely do contain toxic metals.",

I was ecstatic as it was a garage sale find and they are in mint condition, like never used, not even a scuff. My grandmas set was well used, scratched and a couple of the bowls missing (4 in the set, varying sizes). Well I got home with my treasure and hopped online to see out of curiosity what these sets go for - thinking if this set was so pristine, I might just keep it on my shelf as a conversation piece and preserve its 10/10 condition. Wellllll, what i found was horrifying, and the bowls absolutely will never be used now and can just sit forever looking pretty high up on a top shelf never to be touched. The paint they used to make those gorgeous colours \u201cpop\u201d in the 50\u2019s, of course had to be full of lead and cadmium (as much as 100,000ppm). Ugh.",

As long as you aren\u2019t at the poisoned level, your body will break it down and get rid of it but I do suggest you get checked. Adults handle lead better than kids so you can be poisoned and not know it for years until you start exhibiting heavy metal poisoning symptoms and by then the damage is done. And cadmium isn\u2019t great for you either. I get a heavy metal panel done every other year simply because I solder stained glass and work with enamel paints and want to make sure my safety precautions are working (masks, gloves, fume extractors, disposal of paints into plastic buckets with lids which the colleges chemical disposal crew collects, making sure paints stay wet or sealed in bags, etc)",

The issue with decorative exterior lead paint is that it doesn't permanently \\*stay\\* on the item in question, it creates microscopic dust that ends up contaminating other parts of the environment that the object of concern is in. It's going to make significantly less of this dust if it's not in active use and is being used solely for decorative/display purposes, but just \"not licking the paint\" is not an adequate measure of protection from a compound that we know causes brain damage, especially if there are children in your home.   \n\n\nhttps://tamararubin.com/2019/10/1978-garfield-its-not-a-pretty-life-but-somebody-has-to-live-it-glass-mcdonalds-mug-99300-ppm-lead-causes-brain-damage-5833-ppm-cadmium-causes-cancer/",

He asked me if I'd used hot or cold tap water to make the tea (as in what heat was the water BEFORE I heated it up?).  I said hot. He refused to drink it because he said hot tap water had more contaminants than cold. I was pissed because, dude - I made you tea. So I dumped it out and went to make him another cup. But I was young and didn't realize what would happen when I put cold tap water in a hot mug. Yup - it shattered. His hypochondria shattered my Garfield mug. I've always been salty about it - but I've also never used hot tap water to make my tea/coffee. And I was saved from an apparently lead-laden mug. Thanks, I guess, dude.

House paint before the 50's contained about 50% lead, so anyone who hasn't painted their house since then (which albeit is unlikely) is exposed to that. Still, other items like antique ceramics have high amounts of lead.\n\n2. 10% lead on this mug makes little to no sense. If I'm not mistaken, Federal Hazardous Substances Act had already been passed by then, and while there's been cases of toys and consumer items with illegally-high levels of lead even in recent years, 10% lead is absolutely insane.\n\n3. X-ray fluorescence testing makes no sense here either. Paint doesn't detect lighter components like Oxygen and Carbon, which I'd assume there's a lot of in the chemicals used to make paint. For reference, since X-ray fluorescence testing doesn't detect these, a 99.99% carbon and 0.01% lead mix would read as 100% lead.",
