That's a fucking awful look, and minimizing the consequences of unplanned pregnancies on students and departments around the school is surely worth paying for alone.\n\nClarification I didn't think was necessary: there are some universities that won't offer protection for political or religious reasons, I'm sure. But of those that actually do offer condoms, if we assume it is at no cost, I feel pretty good that most if not all would continue if they ended up having to pay. Dropouts aren't good for universities, and I can't even imagine the inconveniences that come along with that mistake for most people involved. And its impressive to me that I can't imagine it- I attended three schools between undergrad and grad, I was an RA and active on campus, and I've taught university a few years, I know literally thousands of samples of dumb college kids and of exactly zero unplanned college pregnancies, all at schools that offer free condoms (maybe not coincidentally also at states where abortion isn't all that taboo, though I bet it's a small part at best). That's honestly very impressive to me. Comparing that to the cost and impact of sheets of paper is wild.",

That\u2019s not a place where you\u2019d want to have an allergic reaction, regardless of whether you\u2019re male, female, or undetermined/other. \n\nAlso, condoms were originally (or historically) made from things like lamb\u2019s intestines (which can still be found today). In the 1800\u2019s rubber became possible for use thanks to Charles Goodyear (yep, the tire guy), and latex became the prominent material used in most of the 1900\u2019s. \n\nCompanies like Durex don\u2019t use latex at all. \n\n100% latex condoms account for 80% of all condoms made, so I guess you could say that condoms are 100% latex 80% of the time lol. \n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condom",

In order to display his body around the country, he was preserved in the \"modern\" manner.

And that's even if we assume every condom prevents a pregnancy, which I imagine is not the case.\n\nSo in order for every condom to save 16 tons per year of carbon emissions, the elimination of that potential birth would have to no effect on whether another birth is more likely. But I imagine that condoms, for the most part, only delay the creation of a person, because lots of people want kids, the condom just helps them time when to have kids. An unplanned pregnancy probably often removes what would be a later planned pregnancy.\n\nThat is, most people who picture having two kids don't decide to have three because one of them was born at an unplanned time.\n\nOf course, that presupposes there are other effective forms of family planning. So condoms probably *do* save quite a bit. Just not the same as permanently removing the emissions of an unplanned pregnancy.",

Cheese doesn't happen with just 1 accidental \"I left it out too long.\" like alcohol.\n\nNo, someone had to cook milk, figure out it curdles, decide they were edible, compress them hard enough that they meld together, stick it in a cool dry place for almost a year, decide to check up on it. Then somehow make a determination that you can eat the damn thing.\n\nCheese is truly deliberate. Perhaps more so than any other food we've ever come up with.",

There isn't exactly a nine month long video of a 3d printer filling 7 cubic meters of volume with plastic with a 0.1 mm nozzle :)\n\nBut there are example pictures of what 0.1mm nozzles can do out there on the Internet (and it's incredible what they can do if properly configured)\n\nAnd if you want to know how long 3d printing takes, it's not exactly a secret. It will, of course, depend on the size of the part and the infill used, but generally you just shouldn't even attempt 3d-printing if you're not okay with waiting 2, 6, 10 hours for a part to finish printing, with print times running into days if you want a big part at a fine resolution.\n\nAfter about a month of using a 3d printer, it actually feels like you spend 10% of the time waiting for the 3d printer to print the bulk of the part, and 90% of the time waiting for those last few layers, since 80% of the actual time of the print your brain marks the status of the print as \"okay, it's absolutely not near completion, nothing to see here\" and completely stops thinking about it.",

The 50 page limit makes it more reasonable for sure, but where i live, in uni, printing isn't mandatory and not a issue, if printing became free, everyone would start printing stuff (opposed to now, that almost no one prints) funds given to unis would need to be re-directed to fund free unnecessary printing. As i said, maybe in the USA there really isn't a fight for resources or trade off in uni resources, the money spent on free printing could just come out of the university profit or by making the university running slightly more efficiently and if that is the case, printing should obviously be free.",

One is a community college, and the other one is an old rich private college. \n\nWhat the poster said above happened in both colleges, and at one of the two places I tried twice 10 years apart. Every time printing was free and unlimited, we would get students printing books constantly. Some would print 1000s of pages a month. We didn't want to charge students though, especially at the community college that's in a poor, small city. At meetings, faculty would argue relentlessly on how they think the issue could be fixed to no avail. \n\nAt the private college, we ended up doing what some of the other posters stated their colleges did, allowing a free amount of pages per month, then charging once they got to a limit. This limit was based on how many pages the worst top 5% abusers printed a month and cut mostly just them off. So most students wouldn't get charged, and having to swipe their card to print made them more conscientious. \n\nThe community college mostly got its printing limited to 15 pages a print. \n\nEven still, both places still have a really heavy problem with paper waste and ink.",

It actually used to be free when I first started working, with an honor code that printing would be limited to 20 pages a day with some exceptions. Seems pretty reasonable, right? Most students would be respectful with their printing and only print what they needed. Then you have the students who try to print out their entire 200+ page textbooks. Suddenly, a service that was free for everyone is now drained by a single person. Toner is not cheap either, and I remember having to write for additional grant money to afford another toner refill because so many students were abusing the system and printing their entire books out. Finally it got to the point where our budget couldn\u2019t sustain the massive amount of printing that these students were doing, so we had to put a small fee per page just to keep the printer running. It was either that, or we couldn\u2019t afford to keep buying toner for it. I think now they give something like 50 pages free a term, which works for most people, but the most important thing that people don\u2019t seem to realize is that the charge per page does not turn a profit over for the labs. It doesn\u2019t even cover the cost to completely replace toner or refill paper. It just helps mitigate the costs to keep them running and available for student use.",

Textbooks could only be loaned out for 2 hours max but you could just scan the pages you needed to a flashdrive and then do the homework at your leisure. I rarely bought a textbook so having a previous edition PDF for the subject matter and a scan of the current edition homework problems was a super easy way to save money.

Certainly can't speak for all universities, but at mine it wasn't about profit (nor did it make any).\n\nThey needed to stem the bleeding from people printing whatever they wanted without a care. Wasting ink, paper, and time in the print queue. Before they had the system hardly anyone duplexed pages. Often we'd find pages abandoned next to the printers because students wouldn't select only the ones they needed when sending a job.\n\nWe left the system in silent tracking mode for a full semester before enacting print allowances and charges. I could see there was a significant drop in pages printed and number of jobs sent once we announced the fees. Also a huge increase in the number of duplexed jobs.\n\nI don't think it was because students could no longer afford to print their work. Each student got a free printing allowance each semester which amounted to a few hundred pages single sided or more if duplexed. Most students never managed to spend all of their free printing allowance by semester end. I think seeing they had to budget and what each page would cost just made students more conscious of what actually needed to be printed and the paper saving options available.",

Using a printer is not if you want to graduate.\n\nYes we need to make sex safer and I don't have a problem with free condoms. But we're talking about *college kids* and *condoms,* not poor people who can't afford basic birth control. If you *really* want to fuck someone, it isn't prohibitively expensive to walk your ass to the store and buy some, if it's that important. The reason why it seems like a public health issue on college campuses isn't on the university, it's on the dumb horny kids too irresponsible to go and buy STD prevention/birth control. If college kids acted like *responsible adults*, colleges wouldn't need to hand out free condoms, because responsible adults buy condoms for themselves. On the other hand, printer ink is ridiculously expensive and an absolute necessity to graduate from college.\n\nAgain, sex is not, nor is it mandatory.\n\nBut maybe BOTH should be free instead of portraying someone asking a very common sense question, the answer to which is very subjective based on what one values and its perceived advantages, as stupid or dumb.\n\nAnd lack of education WILL kill you. You will make less money, live a shorter lifespan, and be more likely to engage in professions or lifestyle choices that will lead to an earlier death.\n\nThe real facepalm is that you posted this in the first place.",

This Tuesday, you make a decision to either skip an assignment, or have unsafe sex.\n\nSkipping the assignment will slightly lower one of your grades. Depending what your grade would otherwise have been, the actual letter grade may not even be affected.\n\nSkipping the condom, conversely, could result in an STD, some of which could affect you for the rest of your life, and/or a pregnancy, which creates an unplanned and likely unwanted new human life.\n\nSo yeah. I would say providing free condoms is probably doing more good for the price than providing more free prints. However, why not both? Allowing students to do more printing, as long as it's mostly used for educational purposes, seems reasonable. It's not like tuition isn't wildly, inappropriately high (in the US anyway).",

      "text": "For what it's worth, the majority of printing in places like this is done with laserjet printers. Laserjet printers don't use ink, they use toner, which is high up front, but the cost per page is astronomically lower than inkjet ink. \n\nFor example, lets take the Konica Minolta Bizhub c240i, which uses the TN-626 cartridge. These cartridges cost around $75 each if you buy them outright. It's about double for colour. (We're going to ignore that a lot of these machines are leased from a dealership, and that usually includes an allowance of toner.) Considering the manufacturer claims 28,000 pages per catridge (in reality it'll be between 25,000 and 30,000 depending on the type of printing) that would bring our cost per page to around 2 TENTHS of a cent per page. \n\nExample number the second: Sticking with this same model, the cost of replacing the fusor. This is the part of the machine that uses heat to fuse the solid powder toner to the paper. This part has a limited lifespan, and if my experience tells me anything, it's not a long one. They cost around $600 for the part alone, then you have to actually replace it. In some machines, specifically Canon ones, this is actually surprisingly easy if you're technically capable. On The c240i, it isnt, so you'll need a technician to come out and install it. If you have a maintenance contract, this will usually be included (At least a couple of times). \n\nIn conclusion, there are reasons why printing costs money, but if you ask me, the unfathomably high cost of tuition to basically any university in America makes the practice of charging ANY amount for prints unconscionable. The only time I can kind forgive them, is if the machine IS leased, and they have to mind an allowance for toner and what are called \"Clicks\" (Imagine mileage on a car, but for copiers) these lease contracts usually also include maintenance, which on large commercial MFPs can be very expensive, so the organization will often end up paying closer to 8 tenths of a cent per B/W print, and more like 2 cents per colour, sometimes up to 5 cents, but I've never seen higher than that.\n\n--edited for reformatting from mobile--",
