Someone running an operation though is a different story. \n\nThere's a drug house across the street from my job, and the police get called there on a pretty frequent basis. My lawyer friend told me, it isn't getting busted because a task force needs to get called in to do a proper sweep if there was going to be a major bust. So without enough evidence and the decision that the time and resources spent on that bust is worth it, the most that happens is it gets potentially put on a watch list to be dealt with later, if at all. Sometimes the the arrests that happen there regularly net more income for them than to just shut it down.",

First and foremost I want better education programs, counseling support for people BEFORE they turn fricking criminal, and actual job training etc... A good percentage of people joining gangs becoming thugs... really could have been decent citizens if they weren't thrown into a garbage area.\n\n\nI agree though, the government seems to lack nuance between \"lock people up for years, then throw them back out on the street, with a big \"don't hire me I'm a former criminal\" sign on their back. Then look super shocked when the guy who can't get an honest job... goes right back to his former gang.\n\n\nObviously the worse of all worlds, is shorten the prison sentance, but do nothing to try to help the person fit into an honest life after prison.",

Well Tommy had a family member that work in an administrative role at the local police department, and this person gave Tommy a call letting him know that the cops were on the way to serve a warrant on the house. Tommy took his dope head girlfriend at the time and loaded her car up with dope and told her to get out of town and he would meet up with her later. The girl didn't make it a few blocks before she got pulled over and arrested. She told the cops it was Tommy's. Tommy said he had never seen her before in his life. She got some years in prison and I remember seeing Tommy for a while after that. Last I heard he got pulled over and hid a big bag of coke down his son's diaper and now he's in prison.",
