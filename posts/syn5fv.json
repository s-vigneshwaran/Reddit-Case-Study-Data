I've been dealing with this for a year and a half due to a pretty serious head and eye injury, you can see one of the scars on the opposite eye, along with serious drug resistant hyperthyroidism, honestly one of my less serious side effects from both. I like to laugh about it, and the situation surrounding the injury as a coping mechanism. It's not that I've become emotionally raw, I just learned to stop giving two shits what people think, even less when it's about something I can't change. I just laugh at it now and the things people can come up with.\n\n You have to remember that everyone is different and will react to the same situations differently. I mean you do you.

I've been through quite a bit, was dealt ab eh deck of cards but I just have to work with what I have.

This means you will either need more schooling after getting your degree, or you will be under valued and put in lower positions until you have gained more experience and understanding. \n\nWhich you could have gotten by starting low in yhe company and having them train you and pay for your education. \n\nIn other words, you will not be an engineer when you graduate. You will have the certifications to be one but you will be a trainee for years without more specified schooling. \n\nWhen I learned how my life would go after amassing all of the debt to become a civil engineer, I quite and went into business. Way happier to have a degree that qualified me for many jobs right out of the gate. \n\nYou will also find that you will be put into classes with lots of other people in things like physics and such, where there are way too many people because civil is such a vague field, that the classes you take will be filled with people in other engineering fields. The work will often pertain to their fields and also yours, because civil is like the retarded little brother of engineering. Hard to learn that way. \n\nIm guessing someone told you to take civil engineering, even though they don't know much about you. Like a teacher or guidance councilor.",
