  "text": "TIFU by having sex with my wife\nSo my wife is pregnant with our first child and we are about 3 weeks away from the due date. Been a while since we've gotten tangled up in the sheets, so we decided to give it a go. Things go great, but 30 minutes later my wife thinks she peed herself, so she gets up, goes over to the toilet, and proceeds to leak clear fluid from her vagina. She calls me over to check where the fluid is coming from as she thinks she broke her water (same thing happened about 2 weeks ago, but just a small amount of fluid compared to this). We shrug it off, lay back in bed, and then it happens again. We think to ourselves \"oh shit, this may be real\". Then she starts getting a contraction, not one she normally gets, no, this one is stronger and lasts a lot longer than usual.\n\n4 hours later I sit here in the hospital next to her bed, she's 8 cm dilated, epidural given, and now we're waiting for our 1st child to arrive!\n\nTL;DR fucked my wife into labor 3 weeks early\n\nEdit: here we go, 10 cm, nurse said they're rounding up the troops and will begin pushing soon\n\nEdit 2: Jason is a 6lb, 2oz beautiful baby boy, welcomed to us at 3am! Thank you all for the wonderful wishes!",

But it's still technically labor. Then they slowly get stronger and closer together, every 10 minutes, then every 5 minutes as you get nearer to the end. The first stages can really drag on, and are pretty boring tbh. The stuff you see in movies, the transitional period and then delivery (last two stages), usually only last one to two hours, and they can be as short as 15-30 minutes. Longer than two hours for pushing, and they tend to go in for c-section.\n\n\nWhen someone says, \"I was in labor for 36 hours!\" it doesn't mean they were screaming and writhing constantly for that long, it mostly means they were in the bed, bored, not allowed to eat or drink, and ready for it to all be over!",

I had full on contractions from about 12pm, every 2 minutes for 6 hours until I was finally dilated enough to push. My daughter was born at 6.20pm. It was hell. I had to labour on the toilet because the pain was unbearable laying down and I could at least stand during each contraction, plus they burst my water bag to try to help things along and I couldn't stand the feeling of stuff dripping out of me. My lovely husband couldn't face to see me in pain so my best friend at the time was the one who helped me through it. Yes my daughter is an only child LOL.  \n\n\nEdited to add, this was in the Caribbean and there was no option for an epidural. At 5pm I was still only 6cm and I was close to having to have an emergency C section (which by that point I was practically begging for) but when my ob/gyn went away and came back about 1/2 hour later, I'd progressed to 8cm so he let me finish labouring.",

My 3rd child's birth was traumatic, but I don't believe I'm traumatized by it. I know lots of people for whom birth was really tough because no one really prepares you for it.

Being a selfish prick during child labor was just one of the examples of what turned out to be paranoid personality disorder. A child does not need \u201cmale\u201d or \u201cfemale\u201d role models, a child needs \u201crole models\u201d, period. It needs people who care for the child and teach it to be empathetic and caring, to think for itself, to form its own opinion, to seek knowledge and perform to the best to its ability. To be respectful and kind and to find happiness in life. A role model teaches this through leading by example. \n\nIf being a father, a male role model means teaching talking down to the mother, have screaming fits for no good reason, gaslight her, be demeaning regarding her accomplishments or otherwise be abusive then in doing so this \u201crole model\u201d teaches children that a mother is nothing more than a maid who can be hurt and abused without repercussions. \n\nIn that case, for the sake of the mother and the children it is better and indeed easier for the mother to become a single mother. (Note that you can change \u201cmother\u201d with \u201cfather\u201d and vice versa, there is abusive behavior on both sides of the fence). \n\nSo, with all due respect, if I may say, your comment is absolutely ludicrous.",

Like, a MILLION times easier. \n\nHe is required to financially support the child no matter what. And the woman leaving doesn't mean he is completely out of the child's life lol. It means that he finally has to step up and be the father he wasn't the entire time he was making her do all of it. \n\nBut a lot of guys like that won't take part custody because he can't dump all his responsibilities on her anymore. \n\nAnd if he disappears and doesn't pay child support, it's STILL better as he probably wasn't responsible with money anyway. \n\nKids are waaaay better off without that kind of \"male role model.\" We have enough men like that in the world already",

What if he turned out to be just a dumb guy but an amazing father? It's a shame how women find it so easy to just write men off as bad and give no path to redemption.

Truly a badass.\n\nOn another note, I highly recommend watching the extended editions and extra features for all three LOTR movies. Absolutely worth the time and money invested. They caught lightning in a bottle; the chemistry of everyone on those sets is the stuff filmmakers daydream about. They truly worked magic on those films.",

One day a woman on fb was talking about how her husband falls asleep eating a biscuit, and he's narcoleptic. I realized that could easily describe me, the rest is downhill. I am just beginning the process of formal diagnosis, but if it walks like a duck and falls like someone with cataplexy... The formal part is for me to seek treatment, but the reality is, it fits to my life and history, and answers so many questions it literally makes me cry if I think about it for too long. So if it's affected his life, tell him he should consult a sleep specialist about a sleep study and multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). Not to be alarming, but your description definitely caught my eye.",

One of the causes of any kind of depression is imbalanced or changing hormones. Pregnancy just kicks some hormones into overdrive while turning off others, and giving birth causes another major change in hormone levels. Coupled with all the other stresses of having a newborn (lack of sleep, body healing, being responsible for a tiny human, family/friends/coworkers/doctors often paying more attention to the baby than the mother, etc) it can be really hard to seek or receive treatment.\n\nSome women may have a strong urge to get pregnant again, but unfortunately it more commonly tends to manifest as an inability for the mother to form a loving bond with the newborn, sometimes even leading to the mother hurting herself or the child. Getting pregnant again without seeking treatment could make it worse. Therapy, hormone stabilizing meds, and giving mothers sufficient help with newborns can help immensely.\n\n(Not a doctor, just helped some friends with thankfully minor cases of PPD. Please remember to ask any mothers of newborns how they're doing too, not just the baby. \ud83d\ude42 )",

I'm hoping that with the assistance of a doula I can have number two without drugs but we'll see!",

Not only does that involve a lot of love and trust (and likely very clear communication beforehand), but it also has its own thread of common sense.\n\nSuppose you didn't want your birthing partner just as sleep-deprived as you are? Especially when already being cared for by doctors and nurses in a hospital setting? Perhaps then after the birth you could rest better, knowing your partner had the energy and presence of mind to intelligently advocate and care for both you and baby? My wife and I never had the same L&D nurse for more than 8 hours, which I suspect may have been the duration of their shift. Who wants an exhausted caretaker?\n\nPartners, before labor discuss what mom thinks she will want. During labor, be willing to change gameplans at a moment's notice. More importantly, be understanding. She may not even know what she wants, especially if it's her first time. You're there to help and support her in any way possible. In my experience, the partner's needs take lowest priority, unless otherwise stated.",

So we got clearance to go to the town next us (an hour drive away) instead. So I drove her while helping her breathe through the pain. Then we get to the hospital and they let my wife in but I would have to wait outside while they did their evaluation.\n\nTurns out she was in the beginning states of opening up so they told me they are keeping her there, but I wasn't allowed in until it's an active birth (aka 10 cm diluted). So I talked to my wife and then called to book a room at the only hotel we knew in that town, a really fancy spa hotel. It was a nice room but I gotta admit I did not sleep well. And I never got that hotel breakfast as she was diluted enough right before breakfast.",

Yes sunlight can help but if the levels get too high which you would not be able to monitor at home then it could cause permanent brain damage.

We don't give a single care in regards to trying to keep people an extra day for money purposes we want you to go home so we can  get the next person in a room. If they wanted you to stay it was a safety concern so they could watch the baby closely, monitor the jaundice levels, and provide phototherapy if needed. Could the baby be ok going home? Yes it could of the baby is high intermediate risk or lower. Jaundice can go away all on its own if the baby is eating well, pooping, and peeing.

The due date is routinely vague and miscalculated because the date of impregnation is not always 100% spot on plus most of the time it's not taken into consideration that the time between different women's periods can differ significantly in length (or is chaotic for many women)...an error that is multiplied by 9. It's even more abstract because doctors use ten 28 day-months to make fetal/embryonic development charts easier to read. Anyway, you most likely didn't fuck up at all and everything's fine (3 weeks is not that big a deal anyway). Congrats!",

It was. Rather foolishly, I drove myself there and back, as partner was busy with something. On the way home, replete with ice cream and barley sugars which were a compulsory element of movie-watching for me - the contractions started !  I had to pull over a few times, but got home in time to call the midwife, and my beautiful daughter was born at home early the next morning. Wishing all of you who are still waiting an easy birth and transition to the joys and heartaches of parenthood. \u2763\ufe0f\u2763\ufe0f",

Induction is also more traumatic on moms body with respect to recovery. Not many people would choose to medically intervene in their bodily processes when there isn't a problem yet (39 weeks being less than average time to deliver).\n\nBut of course other poster knows their situation and their doctor and are getting the best advice available to them, which is right and proper. \n\nAs a rule of thumb though, I agree with you",

My point is  we came within wiskers of having a cloud over our heads for a life time  for a decision  we made.  I think if I had this conversation with someone who has lived through it we would have had a little harder think and ask some more qurstion before we decided to go early with ultra sounds looking good and doctors all agreeing to go.

Getting a huge needle rammed in their ribs  with no meds hopefully missing key nerves to drain an air bubble that's only getting bigger with every breath they take.  All the while your lungs stick together  because the chemicals that prevent this from happening  aren't present enough in the lung tissue.  We had twins at 37 weeks my wife was beyond miserable. After the third trip to the hospital with contractions  and dehydration  due to vomiting every other day we  decided to opt to induce because there was a full nicu staff that weekend that could handle us just in case. We put them all to work and then some.  Luckly like I said we made it with minimal long term side effects so we don't have to revist that decision daily but we came damn close.  There are some good reasons to go early I agree with you. But when it boils down to it I'd much rather have to be the tough one than my brand new kid and I'll leave it at that.",

With a, 'Let's wait to he sure' I went back to sleep, about 6 hours later we were in the hospital and I was getting the 'I told you so'\n\nSecond time round was the same ordeal, we were doing the falling hot air balloon limbo and not long after got the nudge it was time to go.. Again about a month away from due date...\n\nNext one though was different mind you, I'm not sure if we were doing any blimp bonding but what I do remember is going to the hospital incredibly baked, back and fourth between scan rooms and nurses to be brought upstairs and her waters hadn't fully went so they give her something to help along as she was 8cm... It didn't even touch the sides so they decided to do it manually with what I can only describe as a sewing needle... There she is my pride and joy, knees up and appart with two midwifes having a look down the pink sock, one with a torch and the other with the needley thing.\n\nI shit you not, I have never laughed so fucking hard in my life for what happened next. They ruptured her waters as expected and it was like a god dam firehose going off and drenched the pair of them, whatever missed shot right out and off the bed, those two poor women were not amused. Me in the other hand, being cut in half by my beautiful other half's look of death was nearly in AnE myself to get my sides stitched back on... We still laugh about it to this day.\n\nSo, congratulations my dude, and to your better half!",

I was already 5 cm dilated & told to take it easy, don\u2019t stand too long, & def don\u2019t have sex. I asked about oral sex & doc said no orgasms period bc it can cause contractions. Fast forward weeks later a kiss led to making out which led to feeling each other up & my husband goes down on me. I started to protest but he assured me he wouldn\u2019t finish me. 45 min later I had the most mind blowing orgasm (that I asked for) that sent me into labor & my newborn daughter spent 9 days in the NICU. I paid roughly $15,000 in medical bills when it was all said & done. I still feel guilty about it & I\u2019ve only told 1 or 2 people.",

I have to have an emergency c-section due to my first born having sepsis. She was born at 29 weeks. \n\nSo yeah, my husband fucked me into labor too, and we could have died! (No, I don\u2019t hold anything against him. Don\u2019t read into it.)\nMy friend freaked out and said I shouldn\u2019t have even been having sex by this point. Hell, idk. Doctors said it was fine. \n\nSo, the next baby we had was 3 1/2 years later, and we swore off sex incredibly early-on, and I carried him until he was almost full-term (hospital gave medicine that they were afraid might cause it, but I was in so much pain\u2026)\n\nCongratulations on your new arrival!!",

Well, the Dr had the joy of telling us we weren't in fact having a baby just yet but that my wife just had one of the most intense orgasms ever.  I am absolutely certain all the ER staff were aware by now, so we just had to duck out of the ER as quickly as possible.

Stayed out walking and some shopping for about 4-5 hours.\nDidn\u2019t realize how tired we were till we got home.\nWife plopped down on the bed and just froze. Said she thinks she pissed the bed.

Went to sleep and woke up 3 hours later at 2:30am, 5cm dilated and contracting hard as hell, 4 minutes apart.\n\nThe funniest part was when I woke my husband and gave him our code phrase (fries are ready) for \"I'm not joking or speculating, the baby is coming,\" he actually got a bit bitchy about the hour for a few seconds, then I had another hard one, put his hand on my belly so he could feel it, and he said \"oh shit oh shit, he really is coming! I'm sorry, I'll get the boys to your dad's, call him for me!\"\n\nNot too long later, we had a heifer of a 7lb 10oz baby boy.\n\nCongratulations to both of you, my eldest is also a Jason!",

We check in and find what was the most disgusting hotel room we\u2019ve ever seen. Mind you, my wife and I have traveled cross country and slept in cars and showered at truck stops. This was on a different level. There were long strands of hair all over the bed, sink, and tub. The entire room smelt of cigarettes, and the sheets were piss-colored yellow.\n\nI said fuck this and we packed our things back in the car and drove 3 hours home and decided we\u2019d just get our own hotel room 2-3 days before the scheduled delivery.\n\nDuring the evening of the next day we decided to have sex which set off a chain reaction of events that led to us driving *back* down to the hospital that was 3 hours away while my wife was having pretty intense contractions.\n\nIt was a wild experience that thankfully turned out alright. The cherry on top was that there was absolutely nothing wrong with our kids heart so all of it was for nothing.",

He fell asleep 5 times, had to be woken for the delivery and seemed annoyed about it because \u201cI\u2019m just so tired we\u2019ve been here for days.\u201d \nAfterward I got a private room and they set him up a bed there too so he could spend the night and maybe let me have a little sleep but no, Mr I Would Rather Sleep In My Own Bed went home before it was even dinner time. The next day he came without flowers and the whole midwife team just hated him. \nGuys, if your partner is in labour here are some tips. \nDon\u2019t eat in front of her\nDon\u2019t sleep more than once\nStay with her\nBring her some goddamn flowers the next day.",
