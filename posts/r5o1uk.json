I haven\u2019t personally seen the behaviour described above, but when I imagine those adults who hauled ass for a chance to take some selfies/photos of their coffee as teenagers who have been getting all the money from their parents then I can seem them *totally* pulling this off. I can even imagine people holding down jobs, and living by themselves who will still do this. \n  \nI\u2019ve seen adults knowingly order more than they\u2019ll eat through Uber, and toss out that extra food with a bite in it, or leave unopened sides to rot. If these people can waste food (and by extension their money) so willingly without the motivation that comes with a dopamine rush of online validation then *of course* some people will find $5-$10 to buy a gourmet cookie just to take a pic of it.",

And in the same vein, no matter how entertaining you are or good you are at a game, if it's not the right place or right time you probably won't be very successful. If I become a top 10 player in CS:GO, LoL, SSBM or any other high viewership esport title today, I will be pretty well off. However, if my talent is in another game like idk HotS that is well on its way to die out, then while I am very skilled at a game I don't really have the opportunity to transition it into a successful streaming career.",

Still better than the antiwork crowd but if you want a better life - go out and fucking get it for yourself.

Sure, there's luck involved (look at how many car companies there were during Ford's day) but that doesn't mean that it's ALL luck. People just love to blame other people for their own misery.

Actually, it works far better imo because real sports is nothing like watching real sports, whereas I can't even tell if someone is watching a stream or gaming when their hands are obscured by the monitor they are using. Gaming and watching streams are both passive activities of you sitting around on your ass and clicking on stuff on the screen, or using keyboard. \n\nPeople watch sports because athletes play on a far higher level than what you and I can manage, I assume same is for those who watch streamers. Also, not everyone is feeling like kicking a ball all the time, but may feel like watching someone else do it. Same with gaming. Plus, some people say they watch streamers for personality or \"personality\" but again, I don't watch streamers so I wouldn't know.",

Streamers talk way more, and those who aren't chatterboxes aren't successful. Try talking for 2 hours straight with no more than 2 minutes of silence at a time, it is mentally exhausting. Sure, maybe you keep it up for the first hour or so, but as it goes you'll find the time where you go silent gradually increase from 1-2 minutes to 5-6 minutes, and then eventually you stop talking altogether. Im not saying streaming is a difficult ordeal and is as challenging as other jobs, but please don't fucking pretend that people in social gaming events talk NEARLY as much as streamers",

At the same time, extraversion in a certain sense is linked to being self confident, aka having a \"bit of an ego\". Of course, some people have even more ego, and again I'm not saying I don't, but I find that a lot of introverted people can use a little ego because not being confident enough isn't funny... Unless you happen to be really funny. \n\nI do wonder what is the correlation between performing and egos. A lot of media personalities have allegedly giant egos, does it help to be a prick when you're performing?",

Everything they do together feels totally put on for the vlog and you can just watch them slowly hollow out any authenticity from their lives. They're either trying to be trendy or recapture whatever made their channel blow up in the first place. Most channels follow the same pattern of getting engaged, buying shit, getting married, buying shit, having a kid or two, buying lots of shit, getting plastic surgery, and buying lots and lots of more shit before they separate and then each try to do their own separate channels, failing miserably. Those who are still together have definitely died inside, and occasionally hint at their own misery through small comments or moments during their videos.
