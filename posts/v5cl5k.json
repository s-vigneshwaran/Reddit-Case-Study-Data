One may protest against evil; it can be exposed and, if need be, prevented by use of force. Evil always carries within itself the germ of its own subversion in that it leaves behind in human beings at least a sense of unease. Against stupidity we are defenseless. Neither protests nor the use of force accomplish anything here; reasons fall on deaf ears; facts that contradict one\u2019s prejudgment simply need not be believed \n\n\u2013 in such moments the stupid person even becomes critical \u2013 and when facts are irrefutable they are just pushed aside as inconsequential, as incidental. In all this the stupid person, in contrast to the malicious one, is utterly self satisfied and, being easily irritated, becomes dangerous by going on the attack. For that reason, greater caution is called for when dealing with a stupid person than with a malicious one. Never again will we try to persuade the stupid person with reasons, for it is senseless and dangerous.\"\n\n-Dietrich Bonhoeffer before being executed by the Nazis. \n\nAlso this quote from They Thought They Were Free is an interesting look at the slow descent into evil. \n\n\"But the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds or thousands will join with you, never comes. That\u2019s the difficulty. If the last and worst act of the whole regime had come immediately after the first and smallest, thousands, yes, millions would have been sufficiently shocked\u2014if, let us say, the gassing of the Jews in \u201943 had come immediately after the \u2018German Firm\u2019 stickers on the windows of non-Jewish shops in \u201933. But of course this isn\u2019t the way it happens. In between come all the hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next. Step C is not so much worse than Step B, and, if you did not make a stand at Step B, why should you at Step C? And so on to Step D.\n\nAnd one day, too late, your principles, if you were ever sensible of them, all rush in upon you. The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying \u2018Jewish swine,\u2019 collapses it all at once, and you see that everything, everything, has changed and changed completely under your nose. The world you live in\u2014your nation, your people\u2014is not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. \n\nNow you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.\"\n\n- Milton Sanford Mayer",

In fact I don\u2019t think they realize they\u2019re not fighting for the betterment of even themselves. It\u2019s all hatred and scorched earth under what is very clearly a fascist banner. They\u2019re pawns that will be discarded as soon as it\u2019s convenient, which as you pointed out, will be when their oppressive leaders can instead use the now heavily armed police to enforce their new laws. It\u2019s almost inconceivable how it\u2019s not obvious to them.\n\nDo I want to be a gun owner? Think about militias? Not really, but that\u2019s because I\u2019m a millennial. Do I read shit like this and feel mariginally better that I am a gun owner? Of course, but that\u2019s because I\u2019m not an idiot. \n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, I don\u2019t feel right now that this whole thing with MTG is actually going to turn into any substantial movement - but I also know I thought Trump was a bad joke in 2008.

If Ukraine had nuclear weapons, Putin would have never invaded is what he's saying.\n\nBut Ukraine never actually had any type of nuclear operational capacity of any sort. They had nearly 2000 warheads at the breakup of the USSR. But they had zero ability to deliver them in any way. So when people use this argument, it's kind of irrelevant. Ukraine gave up their nukes basically to get them out of their land and make them not responsible for them, with the pinky swear that US/Russia will not invade them. Of course, Russia invaded 30 years later anyway. But Ukraine wouldn't have been able to do shit with them realistically if they kept them. They'd only be a liability of Ukraine.\n\nBut I do agree. With what we know today, if you get nukes, don't ever give them up for anything. Russia is a great example. The only thing keeping Russia alive right now, is the threat of MAD.  Or else the world would have steamrolled Russia by now.",

Yeah, I can say the problem is Moscow Mitch, my neighbor can blame Nancy Pelosi for every problem under the sun (and he does), but unless I live in those districts or states, neither of them has to give a fuck what I think.

We all known she consistently gets things wrong, but she (and her followers) don't care, they feel she's, \"their voice\" and throw dollars at her.\n\nHer and Boebert (who also used and abused social systems and now openly wants to deny others of them) continually gain more and more wealth because they represent ignorance. Large Marge probably has very little actual bills to pay, frequently travels around the country on pre-paid flights to speak at \"rallies\" in where she just says whatever is on her mind that day, more than likely dines out often and higher end restaurants and probably does a healthy dose of personal shopping ALL on the layperson's dollar. \n\nEven after all of that, she (and literally all republicans by this point) continually shun the idea of needing help just to stay afloat in our country... It's the republican strategy again, they did it during Obama too, whenever a Democrat President is in office they become, \"the party of NO\" they refuse utterly every single bill the Democrats propose (usually claiming \"big spending\" yet they have zero issue pumping an infinite amount of dollars into the military) and then they turn around to the public saying, \"you see how much the Democrats are failing! They can't get anything done!\" all because they are super angry at the very THOUGHT of helping someone else.\n\nSomeone here on reddit quoted it better then me, \"the best way to be un-American nowadays is to help others.\"",

Many of the subscribers in /r/atheism also participate in subs like /r/christianity, /r/religion, /r/academicbiblical and the various ex- subs.  \n\nIf you are at all active in one sub related to religion the Reddit algorithms guess that you might be interested in other subs that discuss religious topics.    For a lot of people it is a fairly good guess.",
