But the religious kids could wear jesus shirts every day. So the stoners and freaks rose up, and fought the evil school board to get equality for all. It kinda worked. They banned all religion shirts period. We couldn't wear Satan shirts but they couldn't wear their sky daddy shirts either. Sometimes the weird kids win.",

I would guess it varies a lot from church to church. There was also a Jewish couple that went through the membership process the same time I did. They just liked the way the Unitarians did things, but still considered themselves Jewish. Of the two Unitarian churches I went to services at, one was in what looked like a church and sort of reminded me of a Christian church service. The other took place in a very unique brutalist cement building and was essentially a community meeting with some songs and a short talk about some specific way to act decently.",

A group of satanists/pagans/atheists started holding \u201ccoven meetings\u201d in the same area at the same time, and after the second day they were told by school admin they needed to stop. When I found out, I was livid. I waited for almost an hour to talk to the vice principal about how unfair it was. \u201cIf we can pray, so can they\u201d was the gist of what I said. He called some of the kids from the other group in and told them that I\u2019d advocated on their behalf and they could resume their morning meetings. I told them I believed in separation of church and state, and their rights were more important than my personal thoughts about their beliefs. Whenever I went back to visit my hometown, I\u2019d run into one or two of those folks and they remembered that moment. The Christian friends I had? They were annoyed with me at first and reacted poorly, which was the beginning of my slide away from faith. I haven\u2019t spoken to any of the Christian group in over twenty years.

We gave them lyrics and none of our songs we wanted to cover talked about drugs or booze. The first year we let the girl in charge censor parts of Painkiller by Judas Priest...she didn't like the word killer. We eventually all had to talk to the principal about it and thankfully he was on our side. After that we played heavier and heavier songs until our senior year we almost had 4 different bands of mostly the same people. I played a song by The Faceless and the one by Chimaira",

We asked him where it was and he said that the office took it and said he was no longer allowed to bring it to school because someone complained.\n\nThe ONLY reason he was able to get it back was because a Christian used his religious privilege to go to the office and say something along the lines of \"if that student can't bring their book then I shouldn't be able to brink my bible. Either you let him bring his book or everyone leaves their bibles at home, including teachers\"\n\nThe office listened to the student thankfully but it sucks that another student had to use their religious privilege to get a student to have their own freedoms when the office wouldn't listen to him.",

      "text": "Back in my\u2026sophomore or junior year in high school the columbine school shooting happened. So, back story, we got a new vice principal. She was ex navy, very biased on who she favored and who she didn\u2019t. If you weren\u2019t part of sports you were not worthy. Shorts 2 cm too short, you need to change, etc. So I was friends with the resident goths of the school. They were all nice and chill. She hated them. The theory is that she started a rumor that they were going to shoot up the school and blow it up on the last day. Now one of the \u201chead goths\u201d laughed at this rumor (because it was going around the school before the end of the year and he was a senior). He was like where am I getting all this money? He had a car that he paid for himself, paid for his insurance and had quit his job at arbys like a month or so prior in preparation for college. So, small town, all the officers were there, with dogs, a couple of officers from the next town over and all the cop cars (like 5 of them). The school had banned wearing black clothing (which sucked for the theater kids because if we had TEC rehearsal or a show we had to have our all black clothing to change in to instead of just wearing it to class).\nSo on the last day ALL the goths wore head to toe white with crosses on and shit. She was super pissed and of course nothing happened. She was such a bitch. Really she should have worried about the rednecks. They had to ban gun racks in vehicles because someone had one and their rifle went off and shattered a car window in the parking lot.",
