I use my body, a never-ending string of hookups and shallow friendships, and my overall despotic nature to compensate for having no emotional vulnerability because I live in terror of my fucked up inner self. My father can\u2019t legally contact me anymore, and I cut my mother off too. Currently undergoing EMDR in an effort to finally live a normal life and things are looking up for me for the first time ever\u2026 so it\u2019s up to you to bring me back down, Reddit!\n\n---\nIf you think this bio helped you roast, upvote this comment. If you think it doesn\u2019t, downvote it. If you\u2019re not sure, leave it to others to decide.",

Do you know why that's going to be an issue for you. You are like a 6-8 Pinter. Meaning men would need that many to see you as an option, because that's kicking out time. And unless you get a personality really quick, those 6-8 pints are going to quickly turn into 12 from a brown paper bag beneath a bridge.

And mention that since the solar plexus (gut brain) creates our emotions and feelings by stimulating specific smooth muscles around our internal organs which we interpret as either \u2018good feelings\u2019 or \u2018bad feelings\u2019, and which develop \u2018muscle memory\u2019 over time, giving us a \u2018go to\u2019 emotional state, (breathe in) there is a physical therapy called \u2018visceral manipulation\u2019 or abdominal massage used by some osteopaths, called the \u2018Barral Technique\u2019 (after a French osteopath who took it from Chinese medicine and developed it in the 1980\u2019s), which directly soothes and calms those muscles, relieving emotional stress. Your inner self, your unconscious, your mind, is your emotional state. The solar plexus communicates its warnings to the cranial brain via the vagus nerve and our imagination gets to work on it. If there\u2019s no immediate solution (like running away from danger) the loop from imagination to feelings (solar plexus) and back again, becomes a pattern. Soothing the solar plexus and those internal muscles is literally soothing our inner, emotional self. People I personally know who have had the short massages done report feeling blissfully happy and light as a result.  \nAt some point this may be helpful to you so I pass it on. The Barral Institute has a site and within it you\u2019ll find more info on stress relief.   \nAll the best.",
