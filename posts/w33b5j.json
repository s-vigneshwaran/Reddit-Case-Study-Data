A 4channer uploaded a photo anonymously to the site showcasing his feet in a plastic bin of lettuce. With the statement: \"This is the lettuce you eat at Burger King.\" Admittedly, he had shoes on.\n\nBut that's even worse.\n\nThe post went live at 11:38 PM on July 16, and a mere 20 minutes later, the Burger King in question was alerted to the rogue employee. At least, I hope he's rogue. How did it happen? Well, the BK employee hadn't removed the Exif data from the uploaded photo, which suggested the culprit was somewhere in Mayfield Heights, Ohio. This was at 11:47. Three minutes later at 11:50, the Burger King branch address was posted with wishes of happy unemployment. 5 minutes later, the news station was contacted by another 4channer. And three minutes later, at 11:58, a link was posted: BK's \"Tell us about us\" online forum. The foot photo, otherwise known as exhibit A, was attached. Cleveland Scene Magazine contacted the BK in question the next day. When questioned, the breakfast shift manager said \"Oh, I know who that is. He's getting fired.\" Mystery solved, by 4chan. Now we can all go back to eating our fast food in peace.",

Medicare has billing codes for any and all conceivable medical treatment, this sets the industry standard in what can be billed for. Doctor asks you how you're feeling? That's a verbal assessment and is a billable procedure.\n\n The second problem is insurance companies have hundreds of people on staff to haggle with medical practitioners over how much they'll pay. If a doctor wants to get paid $50 dollars for a procedure the insurance company will offer him $10. So in response to this doctors and medical groups charge super high amounts and hire billing companies, because they know they'll be lowballed on what insurance will pay. So what happens when an uninsured person has to pay? Well, they get charged the super high rate of course because if an insurance company learns that the doctor charged an uninsured patient a reasonable rate that the person can afford, then the insurance company will use that the next time they negotiate payment.",

If there's no emergency, I show up for my appointment and it takes maybe an hour from showing up to leaving. Waaaaay better than sitting in a waiting room for a couple hours because planning ahead is annoying.\n\nEdit: I think we're literally arguing the same thing.

They told me not to worry about it because my out of pocket costs would still be cheaper than $60 since insurance covered me, but my insurance only covers me UP TO AN ANNUAL CAP, which they were going to exceed after all their overinflated bills they charged my insurance...

But their selection is pretty limited and every other medication I've looked at is a lot cheaper on goodrx. I've used 10+ other discount rx app/sites and rarely is goodrx bested in price. Mailmyprescriptions had a few. Ironically the paid monthly service, \"goodrx gold\" makes my medications way more expensive than the free account, so I stick to the free version. Don't know how medications can go from $90 without a discount rx, to $3, but it's very telling that prescription meds are hugely inflated. In fact, buying through a discount rx is way cheaper than through insurance in many cases. \n\n\nPeople I talk to say they don't use goodrx, and rather pay more through insurance so they can hit their deductibles, so their insurance can actually start covering them.... This is a scam in general that I've experienced where medical services are actually cheaper without insurance, the only benefit to insurance is that they'll cover you for large bills like surgery or hospital stays if you've hit that deductible",

He could have done it in the Doctors office and had it done months ago but doing it there isnt covered so it would have costed thousands. \n\nNow this isnt to say the US healthcare system is better (its lobbied to shit and health insurance companies are running a scam), and i do prefer ours.

Just find an itemized bill that includes IV fluid.  \n\nYou'll find that what you pay for it is AT LEAST $100 pr liter.  \n\nThat is NOT including work, NOT including equipment (needles and wiring) and NOT including monitoring.  \n\nYou pay over $100 (again, yes US) per liter.  \n\nThat is a markup of between 10 000 and 20 000%  \n\nNow here's an extra fun part. Check your insurance. Depending on what insurance you've got you may not have to pay directly, or you could be paying up to over half.",

He didn\u2019t want to go too hard with his supermajority because he was the first black President. It\u2019s very literally you who is paying zero attention.  \n\n Obama was concerned about the optics of the first black president \u201cabusing power\u201d and not working with republicans. He has said he regrets his decisions because in hindsight it didn\u2019t fucking do *anything* to appease republicans. But this was a DELIBERATE strategy.   \n\nDo you forget, or most likely you never even paid attention, to the debates between Biden and Trump when Biden is up there saying he is the \u201claw and order\u201d president and he promises to increasing policing. Democrats since bill Clinton have purposely tried to appease to moderate republicans. It\u2019s called [third way](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Way) politics. It came about as a refocusing of strategy by democrats after getting curb stomped by Reagan.   \n\nLike for fucking real dude the absolute ignorance just gushing from your shit.

One or two will *maybe* sorta \"help\" a bit. Everyone in the video and in the comments are saying \"why would you intervene, your family doesn't have enough wealth to pay the debt if you get sued etc. \n\nLook up the [Tang Shan restaurant attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Tangshan_restaurant_attack) from a few weeks ago, where a buncha thugs beat up a couple of women because they rejected the thugs' advances. No one is getting in the middle of that. China is usually safe but outside of major cities like Shanghai, this stuff happens a lot, unfortunately. Bystander effect is alive and well in China.",

Medical bankruptcy is bills for health care treatment > available income.\n\n*Washington Post* on how [only 4% of US bankruptcies are because of medical bills](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2018/03/26/the-truth-about-medical-bankruptcies/). A tipoff that *[insert large percentage here]* of bankruptcies aren't actually because of medical costs is that only 6% of bankruptcies by those without health insurance are because of that cause. Again, the biggest cause of bankruptcies is lack of income, which health insurance doesn't affect.",

If someone is in financial trouble, of course medical bills are going to be among those that aren't paid. That's not the same thing as medical bills causing the financial problems in the first place.\n\nLet me repeat:\n\n>A tipoff that [*insert large percentage here*] of bankruptcies aren't actually because of medical costs is that only 6% of bankruptcies by those without health insurance are because of that cause.",

It's usually a couple hundred bucks max monthly with most healthy young people paying less, unless you have a massive family all insured under you. The amount deducted from your pay check is no different than the amount deducted from your taxes to pay for your free healthcare, if you make a decent salary.\n\nIt's not 100%, but there are also a non-zero amount of people incapable of functioning properly in society. Drug issues, severe mental health issues, homelessness where they just don't give a fuck about medical bills they'll never pay so they don't care about insurance, healthy young people who don't think they need it (me a lot of my adult life, which proved true, and I've always been willing to pay out of pocket if the need arises). For people having medical emergencies, they are guaranteed services under EMTALA even if they can't pay. It's not like swaths of people are dying on the streets because hospitals are refusing them. \n\nRedditors and a complete inability to properly contextualize a situation, name a more iconic duo",

We mean an actual insurance that checks some requirements.\n\nSo it has to do some \"stuff\".\n\nBy this logic, while 91,4% of americans are insured, only a small percentage of them check the minimum requirements. \n\nThis isn't even including the pay.

That completely divorces the importance/criticality of a \u201cthing\u201d from the funding of the \u201cthing\u201d itself regardless of how important that is and that doesn\u2019t make sense. \n\nIf there is a bad year in whatever \u201csector\u201d funds the military, you can\u2019t suddenly just slash the budget as a result. \n\n>Nowadays, the govt just prints money on not much more than a whim, and raises taxes from pretty much any conceivable possible source of material exchange you partake in. The current debt amount boggles the mind. \n\nSovereign debt isn\u2019t the same as personal debt in the same way you couldn\u2019t compare corporare debt to personal debt. \n\n>There is no system in place to sunset certain financial problems, \n\nAs if a system of tariffs would solve this? \n\n>nor any financially motivating reason for a large portion of the population to create or contribute anything better, \n\nThat really makes no sense at all because people still create even without financially motivating reasons. Look at the world changing inventions of the laser or insulin. \n\n>or not get hurt or not get morbidly disabled, plenty of people can live (relatively) comfortable by purposefully being a net drain on everyone around them. \n\nPeople don\u2019t need a financial motivating reason to not get hurt or morbidly disabled. That\u2019s just a preposterous concept. \n\n>In an average lifetime all said and done, a person could have been effectively taxed 60-70% or more of their entire wealth generated, and leave their offspring more debts than anything. This isnt peak society.\n\nLol there\u2019s no way this is true and doesn\u2019t take into consideration the varying tax rates in the world. I bet you didn\u2019t even know that you pay less taxes in the UK than you do in the US up until around ~$100K because of how their tax brackets work.",

Thats what I was referring to. I didnt say you specifically said that, and you arent the only person I've been replying to on this topic, but yes that belief does seem to be held, both in politics and from people on social media who want more and more govt spending with zero emphasis on sunsetting handouts of any kind or an overarching responsible fiscal policy.\n\nI would fund education, but not at a federal level, and not if someone chose to home school or use private schools for example. This is why I said local level, and opt-in.\n\nI feel like you didnt read my previous reply to you, at all?

Because I\u2019m this case, \u201cwe\u201d just gave a hero 400k to cover his medical expenses. The GoFundMe is still open if you want in on the action. \n\nIf \u201cwe\u201d means a government scheme to tax people certain amounts of money based on their income and regardless of their lifestyle choices to pay for any and all medical expenses, I think there are pros and cons to that. How would you go about doing providing medical care for the world?\n\n\\> We choose not to because the threat of homelessness and dying in a gutter forces people to work for the benefit of the ruling class.\n\nI think it forces people to work, yes, but I think a lot of that work goes to benefiting all of us, not just the \u201cruling class\u201d. We\u2019re only a few centuries off from full on Wall-E I think though, so rest easy knowing future generations will have fully automated industry and can sit around enjoying the NEET lyfe. \n\n> This is somehow good.\n\nIf OP\u2019s point was to show a gap in our society where a hero incurred medical expenses that put him out on the street and ruined his life, he picked a shitty one. That\u2019s why I said \u201cthis is somehow bad\u201d, he could pick any number of actual example of people falling through the cracks and getting fucked, but no, we get the example of a guy who is totally fine now and has 400k+ of GoFundMe cash for his trouble.",

              "text": "First off, do we agree the OP is insinuating there should be socialized healthcare to provide for this man\u2019s medical needs? That\u2019s what I got from it.\n\nYour claim that this guy is the exception, not the rule, seems obviously reeetarded unless I am woefully misinformed, in which case I invite you to educate me. At this point I see a bullshit claim that we have tons of people saving children from burning buildings, sustaining medical injuries, and living out what\u2019s left of their lives crippled by injury and debt\u2014 never receiving an ounce of gratitude or financial assistance from anyone. I\u2019m curious why you think this is true\u2014 do you just assume it *must* be because the world is a cruel, unjust hell-hole, or do you actually know of instances like this? It is certainly true that GoFundMes for \u201cgood causes\u201d don\u2019t always get attention, but that\u2019s not A. The implication of the OP or B. Morally equivalent to someone directly saving a life.\n\nThe basic premise of OPs \u201cargument\u201d is that we should look at the end result of the status quo, and from that we should draw the following conclusion: Nick incurred medical expenses in the course of saving lives; Nick has to pay for those expenses himself; that\u2019s not fair, everyone should pay for Nick\u2019s medical bills (\u2026 and presumably all medical bills). Does this same argument work if Nick had say, crashed his pizza car into the side of the house to create a hole for the children to crawl out of, totaling the car in the process? I won\u2019t elaborate with more silly examples, but the point is: what if the costs Nick incurred were to repair his property or to repay his time spent recovering from the ordeal rather than his medical bills? After all, Nick *received* emergency medical attention, he *has* his life and health, he is merely saddled with a bill, and that bill could be for any number of things. There aren\u2019t as many convenient political narratives to appeal to in these instances, especially since\u2014 at least as far as I know\u2014 such acts of heroism with associated expenses are still fairly rare. \n\nThe fact of the matter is that the arguments for socialized healthcare are not and *should not* be based on niche cases of heroics (like this one) that conveniently result in medical expenses. Furthermore, the expenses incurred by heroic acts are not even close to being covered by the solutions of a socialized healthcare system. \n\nSo what do we really want here, and who do we want to provide it? My comment tackles exactly this point, there is not some obvious solution to compensating people who act heroically at great financial expense to themselves. Plus, it is fucking mind boggling to me that you would criticize me for pointing out that OPs one fucking example of this is actually a nothingburger, where despite the absence of such a solution, people came together to create one on their own.

As someone with chronic shoulder and back pain, it is a joke.\n\nMy colonoscopy took 3 months to get done. My back issues took 6 months to even get solid answers. My should took almost a year of back and forth.\n\nIt took weeks after a cancer diagnosis for my mom to get more care. And that was with us barely sleeping calling non-stop.\n\nER takes 4-6 hours to get into, unless you are high on the triage list.\n\nIt is the same everywhere. Non-emergency care is slow. There are not enough doctors. Emergency care is always as fast as possible, and it is never \"days\".\n\nIt is truly amazing how brain washed people got from health care lobbyist in the USA.\n\nAll of my friends out of country have the same experiences, overall... Except for a few differences.\n\n1. They pay so much less than I do, even with the taxes accounted for.\n2. They don't have to be terrified of losing their job.\n3. There is a system to take care of them as they get older\n4. When they finally do get seen, it usually gets done much faster. By that, I mean, if they need a scan, it just gets done. Because there, with way less private practices, everything is at hospitals and in the same medical system. So when the doc wants a scan, it just gets done the same time. God I wish I had that, instead of weeks between visits.\n\nThen you know the final difference? Politicians, CEOs, and upper tier shareholders are not making absurd profits on your medical issues in socialized systems.\n\nFinally, to be fair, Canada is a bit slower, statistically. But that is an average of everywhere for everything. Look at Canada's population density maps, and the USA. Compared the dense areas. They are about the same. Because, again, we simply don't have enough doctors.. anywhere, worldwide.",

The birth didn't go well and after trying gas and epidural pain relief she had to have an emergency c-section. She required long term care, both for her operation and also for her mental health due to all the complications of birth and the aftermath. After over a month in hospital with round the clock care she was released with our daughter and we went home. We left the hospital without paying a single dollar for medical bills.\n\n\nReckon you could do me a price check on that little incident, mate? We can compare it against what I've paid in tax for medicare. I'm willing to bet it'll work out pretty well for me.",

We can't just take a million people a year whom have not paid into the system and expect this not to just implode.\n\nSo we have a choice: scale back immigration by a large amount or forego universal healthcare. We simply don't live in a reality where we can have both and if you need proof, look at the UK. They similarly have large scale immigration and every single year more and more money is funneled into the system. It's just money printer go brrr and this will help no one in the end.",
