So parking closer may help her reduce the time pushing the cart. \n\nYes one arm pushing is possible but difficult to direct and many lots may not be even or well maintained making it harder to move the cart where she wants even with the prosthetic. \n\nThat's my theory on parking closer for an arm prosthetic with no other known issues that may or may not contribute to the decision to park there.",

People watch a video like this and then wonder why so many disabled people are agoraphobic, or at the very least don't like to go out or interact with people. The physical and mental exhaustion it takes to just live in an unaccommodating society that does the bare minimum by law to help and sees disabled people as a burden, is more than most people can imagine. The younger you are and the more invisible your disabilities are the worse it is. I would rather pay a little more to have something delivered to me then risk going out and running into someone like that.\n If you know someone in your life who is disabled offer to go with them if they have to go out somewhere. Things like this are less likely to happen when there are multiple people. Also just a reminder to those who need it don't assume and don't be a dick you never know what a person is going through!",

I explained about my vision loss to the phone assessor and she asked if I wear glasses.  I do because what vision I have left is short sighted so i said yes.  She asked, \"So when you're wearing glasses you can see fine?\"  I said, \"The glasses don't bring the missing vision back.  I'm always partially sighted.\"  She ignored me and actually wrote down that wearing glasses does restore my missing vision!  She wrote loads of other lies about me,  denied me benefits and I had to go to appeal.",

In these situations we end up having to go to tribunal (or court) where they will say \u201cwhy have you not listened to the expert medical staff here?\u201d And then grant us full payments with back payments etc.\n\nBut it takes 12+ months to get to court and often you won\u2019t be getting paid in that time - this is when they hope you die or \u201cget off your arse\u201d and find a job.\n\nIt happened with my wife. It happens every day with other disabled people in the U.K. too - it isn\u2019t even a secret anymore, it\u2019s right wing policy to do this. They will deliberately fail your disability assessments even with overwhelming medical evidence etc, in the hope you shut up and die. \n\nI think the overturn rate for cases going to court was something in the high 90%\u2019s. \n\nThe U.K. should frankly be ashamed of itself, but this anti disability policy has been in place for over 10 years now and people keep voting for it and then crying crocodile tears when it makes the news (if it bothers getting that far anymore).",

You have to present paperwork to the Social Security Administration and they determine whether you are approved. Most times it takes at least a year to hear anything back. If you are declined (most people are the first time), then you have to appeal to through a special SSA court. That can take 12-24 months. If you are declined, you can appeal to a higher court, or start your case again. I went through the whole process, up to going to court and was turned down at the initial level and at the court level and I had an attorney the whole time. I dumped that attorney and got a new one and started my case from scratch. I was able to get a court hearing within six months and was approved at trial. It is a very hard, stressful, demoralizing process.",

It\u2019s kind of a bummer to think how small the list of movies that actually pass it is. I don\u2019t think this necessarily means movies were sexist by themselves, in fact a lot of movies that don\u2019t pass the bechdel test are very much decidely **not** sexist at all. It rather indicates that most of the creative crew behind movies were men up until a few years ago, and people tend to write what they know.",

It certainly wasn't presented as some kind of academic measuring stick with which to empirically determine if a film was properly representing the genders. It was kind of a joke that was put out on a single comic strip in an alternative newspaper. \n\nIt just resonated with people that they really couldn't think of that many films that could pass the test. And that's a problem. The test doesn't solve the nagging issues of representation in Hollywood, but it sure did bring attention to it in a way that people could easily digest.\n\nThe problem would be if you look at the Bechdel as an end point. I think most people, quite reasonably, think of it as a place to start.",

You can apply without PIP absolutely but if you're above a certain points threshold on PIP you're automatically eligible (though of course you still have to apply to your council). But you're absolutely correct that you can apply for one without PIP in place and I imagine the process is easier, getting my PIP took such a long time and was so invasive.

But, if/when they do approve it gets backdated to when you applied. Mine took a year, but then I got a full backpayment and my disabilities aren't straightforward either. The initial call to get the form is straightforward. The form itself is big but gives you a lot of opportunity to explain your difficulties. Then the assessment is about an hour to 90 minutes.

I pay good money so that my shoes don't shiw from miles away that I am disabled, fir most people I just look like a 30 year old.overweight guy.\n\nThat said, issues with parking spots like these luckily are rather uncommon where I live due to the fact that, if you want to park on a disabled parking spot, you need a special sticker on your car that are issued by the government.

The worst part is I'm only in my mid 20's so people constantly accuse me of faking disability when I need to use my walking stick lol\n\nI remember once I was on the train and sitting in the disabled seat while holding my cane and this 40-50 year old woman got on. There were no seats available and she stood in front of me and told me to stop pretending and give her the seat because she was older than me and tired. I just had enough of people like her, so I just stood up, showed her my disability card while saying (loud enough for everyone around to hear) \"lady did you really just force a disabled person out of his seat so you can sit instead?\" Then I just stood beside the now empty seat while telling her it's free now. She was obviously really embarrassed tried to be nice and \"offer\" the seat to me but I've learnt the only way to stop this crap is to really embarrass people like that so they can learn their lesson haha\n\n\nEdit: thanks everyone for my most updated comment :D",

My father just said I was lazy. It wasn't until about 15 years ago he was talking about his hip pain and how people didn't see it, like a broken arm they would, but he's still in pain. I just told him, \"Welcome to my world.\". He gave me a weird look, and since then he actually asks me how my back is, etc. Sadly bosses don't care about pain.\n\nI hope your day to day isn't filled with assholes like that woman.

Our tax dollars get wasted on way stupider things than a couple of \u201cfreeloaders\u201d getting their pathetically small government cheque every month.

I use a wheelchair 100% of the time and deal with very obvious spasms, spasticity, and limitations. It still took months to get my SSI approved and then several months more for the SSDI to kick in. I had to do multiple interviews where I showed up so they could make sure I was disabled enough. It felt like a complete joke and an absolute circus! To this day, they constantly send me mail about how I could go back to work with a heavy implication of \u201cshould\u201d.",

All three of the other members have days where they're ok and they would never use disabled services if they're having a good day, but it's so rough having to be with them when they need to use those services and seeing the looks or hearing the comments people will make sometimes.  To make it worse they're all the nicest people and are not the kind of people that will argue or make a fuss.  I feel like most people are becoming more accepting of this lately that not every disability is visible, but yea. It's rough sometimes.",

She's been told to get out if disabled seats on the bus and stuff. \n\nI have chronic fatigue syndrome and autism. My chronic fatigue means I can't walk far without getting excessively tired and out of breath. \n\nMy mum has fibromyalgia and can't lift much or walk far. She's got a blue badge for her and one for her daughter (who's also disabled). I don't drive so I don't need one. There's been times when we've parked in the disabled spots and got out the car and had people confront us about it. My mum points to her badge displayed in the car. Then informs them we're both disabled and just because we're not in a wheelchair doesn't mean we're not disabled. The badge usually shuts them up. \n\nWe've seen so many people park in those spots without badges. And in the parent and child spots without kids with them. If my mum sees this happen she'll have a go. If they don't have kids with them and park in the parent and child spot (we usually park there as I have my toddler with me all the time) she'll say 'did you forget your kids?' \n\nI hate this whole idea that people have that if you're not visably disabled i.e in a wheelchair then you're not disabled.

Are you or someone you are assisting disabled? \n\nYes.\n\nDo you mind showing me your placard? \n\nIt\u2019s right there.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to offend but my brother is in a wheelchair and it sets me off sometimes because some people take advantage. I know not everyone is in a chair or are obviously disabled but sometimes I just check. I am really sorry, and won\u2019t waste any more of your time.\n\nThere. Done. That is how you handle this situation. You don\u2019t fight an old woman and swear at her. If you\u2019re trying to uphold societal rules, be goddamn civil. That is the crux of Karenhood and why they all seem to miss the goddamn point entirely in these rants.\n\nYes, flip out when someone misbehaves.

A disabled person can lend their car to someone healthy and they must not used these spots. And vice versa - even if only a passenger is disabled, you can park there for a short time (at least where I live). Binding is the personalized medical document.\n\nSo asking \"why do you park here\" is a legit question. Enforcing these rules helps the disabled people and there is no other way to enforce them. So - what are you complaining about... Of course they have to accept the actual status of the person and not try to argue and enforce some self made \"rules\".",

However, I'd bet it's a minority. We're all so dead set that a disability has to be visible to be valid.  So many are not.  We need national public service announcements, or something, in all forms of entertainment.  \n\nBtw, if he's still having issues, have him try Liquid IV.

Part of my anxiety and panic attacks are from having it attached, and not being able to remove it.  Not feeling in control over it is the part.  I can't stand having something attached to me that I can't remove.  I had to wear a cast, for a wrist replacement, and it caused the same issues.\n\nBag goes in two weeks, and J pouch is getting hooked up.  Gotta wear some adult diapers for a few months, but I can't handle that.  I can't wait to get my life back!  I had been fighting with ulcerative colitis since 2016.  It governed my life.  Always there, always ready to strike.  Soon, *I* will be in control!  *I* get to call the shots again!

Most of them were either born with it or developed it at a young age, (we are all currently around 17-24 years old, I met them around 5 or 6 years ago). I watched a few of them struggle with trying to hide their disabilities or appear as independent as possible. One of my friends, she appeared the most 'normal' out of the blind schoolmates, sometimes she tries to distance herself from them because she didn't want to associate with them (she developed it at a later age compared to the rest who were mostly born with it), but now she has fully accepted her disability and isn't afraid to use her cane when moving around. One of my other blind friends used to be very stubborn with using his cane, he always tries to walk around alone without the cane (or he holds my shoulder when we travel together), but he ends up occasionally bumping into people, which sometimes instigates a fight because those people don't believe that he is blind (even though his extra thick lenses on his glasses should be enough proof that he isn't someone who can see well. If they had looked more closely, they would be able to see that his eyes are 'different'). In the recent years he started using his cane all the time, probably to avoid such situations from happening.",

People using mobility parking spots without any placard to say they can park there. And even then they don't need to be confronted about it. I've literally said to people in a kind tone \"don't forget to display your permit\" because again invisible disabilities exist and they may have forgotten to display, so it acts as a gentle reminder if they forgot but also a small callout if they're parked there illegally. \n\nAnd then if they tell you to F Off, as people who are illegally parked are inclined to do, it can then be escalated to the relevant body. If everyone changed to say it like this if they felt the need to make sure people aren't abusing these parks, then people with invisible disabilities wouldn't have deal with being confronted about their disability anywhere near as often as we currently do. \n\nIn the meantime, who cares if a few people are abusing the card, why should those of us who do need those spots have to deal with people deciding we're not deserving on the off chance?",

There are people saying they throw dirty looks at people who aren't displaying a placard. I've experienced it a lot, hence I even have a script for dealing with it - have you forgotten to display your permit?\n\nHow can you tell if someone is misusing a placard by using someone else's? *You can't*. Because invisible disabilities exist.\n\nYou say people misusing the card is a problem. But you don't know if they're misusing it. There is no indication that anyone can give that that's not their card if they have an invisible disability. And it's that mentality (they must be misusing it because they look fine) that leads to confrontations. So sure, there might be some people who abuse the card, but you will never know for sure unless you confront them - which disabled people all through this thread are saying they've had to deal with, they've had to prove their disability to absolute strangers because someone took it upon themselves to assume they were misusing someone else's card.\n\nWhich is why I said if you think someone is misusing it don't confront them, go to the relevant authorities about it. We are sick and tired of people judging us for using a tool that we have been given by our medical provider because of this assumption that there's a huge problem with people abusing the card.",

It wasn't until I got an actual diagnosis, 6 years after it started, and only because it was a physical issue, that she shut up.\n\nWorst part is, she spread that shit for years to others.  I don't look like there is anything wrong, since it is severe nerve damage in my skin.  People that don't know me that well, and I only see on occasion, still have that opinion because of her.  It's been 10 years since I finally got my diagnosis.  I don't have the time or energy to set them straight.  Sometimes they stop my wife and complain to her, but she doesn't know enough to set them straight.  She just ignores them.\n\nAn edit:  Thank you all for the kindness you've shown!  I've mulled over getting a disabled placard for many years.  I'm going to do it now.  I have an appointment with my pcp soon, and I'm going to talk to her about starting the process.

I don't think she did either, but she had always had knee & joking pain.\n\nYears later when I'm a teenager with a lot of mental health issues & unsure of what else to do to help me, we decided to try genetic testing. As it turns out, they found out that I & my Mom both had this rare genetic disease/disorder called Elhers-Danlos Syndrome; specifically the hypermobility type.\n\nIt explained a lot, & she realized her Mom had it too. But the hypermobility type of EDS is a genetic disorder in which the connective tissue in your body (aka the glue that holds ALL parts of your body together) isn't formed properly & breaks down at a much faster rate than for someone without.\n\nEDS is almost COMPLETELY invisible as a disability, not to mention it's rare. So if someone were to ever say shit like this to my Mom, she would NOT have it whatsoever.\n\nI also wanted to share this because of awareness. I've been a legal adult for a little while now, but I have also noticed that I already have issues of joint pain myself. There isn't a cure, & there's really no known treatments for it either. Plus it's degenerative, which means it only ever gets worse.\n\nThis website is a good source of information last time I checked. https://www.ehlers-danlos.com/what-is-eds/\n\nHopefully this can make at least someone more aware, if nothing else.",

              "text": "Hey fellow Zebra! I have Classic EDS and once I got my diagnosis things made so much more sense! Not just for myself either but for other family members... My mum, sisters, my Nana, extended family. Just discovered it also runs through my bio-fathers line with 4 cousin's and my grandmother now diagnosed with Vascular EDS.\n\nI was the first one diagnosed, and due to running in both my genetic lines, I'm also the one with the most health issues (yay crappy genetics) with daily dislocations/subluxations in multiple joints and chronic pain.\n\nI use the example of a rubber band. Joints are held together by a rubber band (connective tissue) and for most of the population that rubber band works well. A regular person suffers a dislocation, they get time to heal and rest up and their rubber band then works as it should. An EDSer dislocates a joint and that rubber band becomes slightly stretcher, which leads to a second dislocation. The rubber band over time becomes stretchier and stretchier leading to more dislocations, no matter how much rest you give the joint.\n\nEventually that rubber band is so stretched out it's completely useless. So our muscles are having to take the load of holding joints in place instead of that rubber band. This leads to frequent pain as well as muscle tears. Scars build up internally where muscle tears happen, and if it's a really bad joint, those scars just tear open again and again. \n\nUnlike regular people who dislocate something, usually from some kind of trauma, this happens to EDSers without any real accident causing it - the accident may have happened years before hand and look completely unrelated - and EDSers heal slower so we don't get 6 weeks downtime to heal, it could take 3-6 months to heal, and if it's constantly falling out of place there is no healing time. So we just push on through and keep doing what we have to despite dislocations.\n\nThat's not even getting into the fact that it's a collagen disorder, collagen is in connective tissue, skin, organs. So it's multisystemic in that you look fine, but fragile skin means frequent skin tears, organs not working properly, digestive system doesn't work properly, eye issues, hearing issues... Basically anything that has collagen and connective tissue can have issues. \n\nAnd that makes it difficult to diagnose despite there being easy tests for it, because doctors don't connect the fact that a person has frequent ankle sprains or unexplained pain with their eating issues, or their eyes not functioning properly, or frequent anal tears. This leads to people having to figure out they're own way of coping while being told there's nothing wrong and wait times of 10+ years before finding out what's wrong and then having to find a doctor who actually understands EDS and is competent enough to diagnose it, let alone actually getting any treatment while the body continues to deteriorate.",

Here's hoping that you can keep relatively safe and not suffer too much pain. Tip from someone with a knee injury, try not to favour it if you possibly can. I destroyed my knee at 16 and spent years favouring that knee because of how often it popped out. That put strain on my hips/sacrum, and then those started popping out, next it spread to my shoulders as I was intuitively counterbalancing but that was causing damage to my shoulders, neck and back. The shoulders then caused cascading issues down my arms - elbows, wrists, fingers. Not much I can do about it now, but if I'd known about it at 16 when I destroyed my knee, I'd have been very careful about favouring the knee.\n\nWith your leg length are you able to get an elevated shoe for the shorter leg in order to balance out your hips?\n\nI was diagnosed at 31 after I tore my rotatorcuff, and I'd sustained a lot of bad injuries over the years so my body is just an absolute mess. I can barely count the number of joints that *haven't* dislocated on one hand now. But oh well still alive and kicking (gently, don't want to dislocate a knee lol).\n\nAnd thanks, yea vEDS is the only one that's a death sentence, life expectancy is around 50. I've had three cousin's die from it, so the fact my Nana was diagnosed at 80 is a friggen miracle! Her brother passed last year and he was nearly in his mid-80's, while not formally tested there's no doubt he had it as it was his daughter and two granddaughters who passed with vEDS. So there are some people who beat the odds.\n\nI hope both your mum and yourself are able to get some good help!",

          "text": "About 8 years ago, I was dealing with a ruptured disc in my lower spine. I could stand up, and even walk, but after about 10 seconds my leg felt like it was one fire. By 30 seconds the pain was so bad, I wanted to curl up into a fetal position and cry. The fucked up thing was that if I sat down, the pain would _instantly_ disappear. \n\nAt the time, my problem was misdiagnosed as a torn hamstring, and I never got a handicap placard. Eventfully, the actual cause was diagnosed. Basically, I went to a chiropractor, who sent me for an MRI, and called my from their personal number at 10 pm that night to tell me I had to go see a neural surgeon _immediately_ because it was an emergency. I went and saw a neuro surgeon about two days later. I showed up, and I gave his nurse my MRIs, and sat there for over two hours before he came in. When he did, he apologized for the delay, and told me he had spent those two hours scheduling me for emergency surgery two days later; this involved arranging the operating room, the anesthesiologist, blood work... and I don't know what else. \n\nWhat he told me was that my spinal cord was compressed more than 90% of the way, and I was at serious risk of being paralyzed from the waste down, or at the very least being incontinent, if I had _anything_ happening that put stress on my lower back. A low speed car accident, a bad fall, _just waling too much_... It was an emergency situation and it need to be addressed by surgery _immediately_.\n\nI'm happy to say that the surgery was a success. The pain was entirely gone once I woke up from it.\n\nBut  _before_ the surgery....\n\nWalking from my paring spot at work to my desk, a less than 5 minute walk, was _agony_. I was entirely incapable of going grocery shopping with my wife because standing and walking for that long was _agony_. Just walking from a parking spot to the front door of the grocery store was usually more than I could bear.\n\nThe point I want to make is that from the outside, I appeared to be a hale 30 year old man. But the pain... dear god, the pain... You don't know, and _cannot_ know what the subjective experience of another person is. I had no external indications of being disabled, but I fucking _was_. I longed for a handicap pass that would let me park 20 feet closed to the front door, because that was 20 more feet I could tolerate standing in the fucking store. \n\nI get wanting to police those spots. I get wanting to come down with righteous anger and furious indignation those who would abuse it. But _if you do so_, you are _going_ to end up being an asshole to people who _fucking need it_ who _don't_ have ant or the obvious external signs of being disabled.\n\nThese days, I'm pain free, and I have a nice enough car that I _want_ to park away from the entrance. And I feel lucky and fucking _blessed_ that I can do so without having to deal with the pain. \n\nSo fuck those people who police those spots. They may feel a sense of righteousness, but they ought to feel ashamed of themselves because of the thought that their overzealousness might mean that someone who fucking needs it, like I did, can't avail themselves of it because of them.",

The visible accessibility features are focused on wheelchairs.\n\nHaving the accessible symbol be a wheelchair only reinforces the notion that this accessibility feature is tailor made for wheelchairs.\n\nBut in reality, accessibility takes many more forms than just wheelchair accommodations. Sharps containers in public restrooms, food ingredients and nutrition labeling, closed captioning, high contrast design, these all serve to accommodate all people into public spaces.",

Not wanting to leave me alone at home, my husband would bring me a motor cart and I\u2019d just tooter around the store with him like that. It was a very short time, maybe two weeks before I stopped having dizzy spells but I did get enough angry stares, not just from what I assumed were judgemental assholes but I even got hate from random old and fat people who were the only ones to stop me and let me know how selfish it was of me to take the cart so one of their kind (fat, old and both) wasn\u2019t able to use it. \n\nI felt guilty the whole time, conditioned to think that even after I\u2019d had my chest opened up, my muscles detached and sewn back together again over 420cc\u2019s of extra mass, I wasn\u2019t injured enough to need a cart despite that I was exhibiting classic trauma-recovery signs.  \n\nLater, when my husband had major back surgery, he actually refused to go to the store at all anymore since he was a fat guy and was worried people would just think he was another fat guy on a scooter. Nevermind that he got fat by not being able to exercise because his back was messed up and I work 12 hour days, he\u2019s going to eat whatever he wants when I\u2019m gone if he notices it or not.",

An old Reddit thread had a link to TikTok that seemed to satisfy people but it's not working anymore.\n\nAnyway, the video had an Ark Media watermark, and they say this on their website:\n\n> If you are here, perhaps you have a video which has a big potential to go viral or maybe it already has, and you are looking to cash in on it!\n\nOk, so people pay them to make videos go viral. They also have a video with another angle of this on their website:\n\nhttps://ark.media/videos/argument-over-disabled-parking/\n\nNotice on that page it says \"As Seen On KOMI\". What is that? It's another internet media company.\n\nhttps://komi.social/about-us/\n\nAnd...\n\n> The company then launched its first global brand called It\u2019s Gone Viral on Facebook in late 2016.\n\nWhich is what you linked to. (The Facebook page also links to the KOMI website so this isn't exactly a secret.)\n\nArk Media and KOMI are both located in Manchester and they have the same phone number listed on their website, so I think they're the same people. I guess they have different brands to try to look more organic. (Maybe UK people have heard of these companies before?)\n\nAll of this isn't really proof, but I'd think they would know the origins of the video if they were paid to make it go viral.\n\n\nEdit: Son of a bitch...\n\n[KOMI group launches Ark Media \u2013 its new licensing, syndication and rights management division](https://businessmanchester.co.uk/2020/06/23/komi-group-launches-ark-media-its-new-licensing-syndication-and-rights-management-division/)\n\nEdit: OK, I'm about to blow this whole thing wide open. The young lady says \"the rest of us have to park all the way over there.\" You can see a car behind her and some more in the second video, but take a look at this:\n\n(AutoMod removed my original comment for linking to Google Maps. The address is \"81 Wilton Place Manchester\".)\n\nThere are 52 numbered spots in that lot. I'm not sure what more proof you could need, but I think I've done my part.",

I told her to wear booty shorts so her scar thar covers half of her leg is in plain view, but i doubt that'd stop people. Entitled pos, if they have a handicap sticker you bet your ass im minding my own business.\n\nThese people arent being allies, they arent even being helpful, their being albiest and discrimminatory and see an easy targets that dont have visible disabilities so thst makes it more okay to verbally berate them than a wheelchair user (and even then ambulatory wheelchair users get so much shit), cause look! They can walk and talk, theirs nothing wrong with them!/s Because apparently accomodations get disabeled people ahead of everyone else and were just spoiled/s when in reality they put us at the starting line with everyone else if that. I get this too, service dog handler real fun times, but i refuse to use accomodations to avoid being harassed if I can including just not leaving my house, im very thankful I dont have my sisters level of mobility issues but definitely been harassed and followed for just having my sd with me in public, especially when he tasks and alerts im about to have a medical emergency people assume hes goofing off no hes trying to get my butt on the floor before i fall over.

Even a perfectly healthy *looking* kid might be disabled. \n\nAlso now that I think about it I actually know someone who has a degenerative disorder where the more they use their joints the quicker they will wear out and they\u2019re not going to be able to walk by the time they\u2019re 40. So they have to try and walk as little as possible. Yeah they can walk from the edge of the parking lot fine, but why tf would they do that? That\u2019s essentially like 100 yards they won\u2019t be able to walk when they\u2019re older.",

I would park in a handicap spot, go inside and get an electric cart to bring back to my mom.\n\nFirst, the amount of dirty looks I get as I get out of the car to walk inside to get the cart have been numerous. People just don't think past themselves.  They just judge.\n\nSecond, as I'm riding the cart out to my mom, people see me and usually go two ways in their thinking, either I'm perfectly fine and shouldn't be in the cart and they are therefore disgusted with me, or they assume I am disabled and instantly become invisible.  The amount of people who choose not to even RECOGNIZE someone with a disability is gobsmacking.\n\nIf I see these people later in the store as I'm walking next to my mom using the cart I always make sure I make eye contact.  They're usually very uncomfortable and try to avoid it.\n\nThat said as well, I have pretty bad asthma and the amount of shit I'll get from certain co-workers for staying home when I'm clearly not sick to them, or fit their preconceived ideas of what asthma actually is are completely frustrating.  They literally take breathing for granted.  They have no idea.  They CAN'T SEE a disability so it doesn't exist.",

The side eye and double takes I got pulling into a disabled parking space was always pretty funny to me.  Of course, they'd quickly realize as soon as they saw me walking to or from the car that I needed it, but I have gotten notes left on my car by people who somehow didn't see the handicap tag on the car accusing me of being a 'rich asshole', etc.  \n\nI've also had people threaten to 'report me to social security' when they 'caught me' working out at the gym.  I try to take it all in stride.  Many people are rooting for you, most are at least reasonable, but for some people seem to go a little crazy with indignation when you violate their stereotype of what a person with a disability *should be*.",

It makes us both want to rage.\n\nSo while I appreciate that some citizens, like this crop top woman, also feel the rage, she should really have more awareness regarding what she\u2019s doing. \n\nIt\u2019s easier to just take a photo of the car and report it to the local government and let them work it out.

They looked at me like I was the scourge of the earth and sometimes people even called me out and said I was a tool or a dbag. The girl in this video reminded me a lot of them.

But at the same time, there is an important lesson in this which i will say even though it is fairly obvious to most decent people. You shouldn't treat people like criminals without cause and having to defend yourself for doing nothing wrong is really dehumanizing and stressful as hell. This lesson is relevant to the topics of disabilities, race, gender, age, mental health, etc. \n\nDon't confront someone like this unless you know FOR SURE that you are right.

For those not in the know, i bleed into my joints and muscles, on most days I'm fine, on the bad ones, I'm not.\n\nThis Christmas I was dealing with blowback from a knee injury due to a bad episode. I needed to get my shopping done though and tried to brave the store. I used the cane at the mall because there were no chairs available, and I was feeling somewhat ok enough to walk... And then then some kid started pointing at me and tugging on their mother to see me. Embarrassing :/\n\nAt Walmart I needed the chair, but there were none on the side I entered at, so I hobbled over, wondering who was judging me for using the chair if I could walk to it just fine. Given my young age and my cane folds up when I'm not using it, always leads to stares in the store. \n\nI wish I could say it's just the children that point, but it isn't. I'm fortunate enough to 97% of the time, being able to hide what's going on with me. My point being is, people like this are why the we have insecurities about being watched constantly, and sometimes afraid to go out just because we don't want to deal with being accosted on top of our other problems.\n\nTo the guy at Walmart who offered to help me put the chair away when the battery died, I appreciate the offer even if I didn't accept it. Was nothing on you, independence is just, makes me to stubborn to accept help sometimes",

It causes lesions and massive sores to develop in my armpits, under my breasts, and around my groin. The sores burst open and drain constantly. I have sores that have been open wounds for months. My armpits, breasts, inner thighs, and nether regions are covered in twisting, rope-like scars because sometimes the lesions create tunnels under your skin. I can\u2019t wear shorts or tank tops without people seeing my sores and scars. \n\nWhen I have an active flare-up, I can\u2019t lower my arms or walk without being in white hot agony. Some days I have to lie in bed not moving. Because the sores drain, they get extremely raw. Showers are excruciatingly painful. Sometimes, the open wounds dry to my clothes and I have to rip them off at the end of the day, reopening them. My bedsheets are covered in blood smears and dried drainage every morning. I can\u2019t wear or own anything \u201cnice\u201d because I bleed and drain on everything. I have to power through the pain some days and go to the store or run an errand. Every step I take is excruciating. Imagine vigorously rubbing denim against an open wound and you have a great idea of what it\u2019s like. It\u2019s just constant and exhausting, and there is no cure. \n\nI typed all this because not a single person outside of my mother, husband, and doctors know I have it. You can\u2019t see my wounds. None of my scars are visible. I force myself to walk and appear normal in public despite the immense pain I am sometimes in. So many horrible disorders, diseases, and illnesses can dramatically impact a person\u2019s ability to function without ever being visible to passerby.",

Slowly covertly scheming. The world is their soap operas and they are the puppet Masters and will create nightmares and drama literally out of boredom...\n\nEveryone thinks they have the one that will get better, or maybe it's not narcissism it's not like they are full of themselves, or they don't really abuse me so I'm fine... But nah... If you have even a sneaking suspicion I suggest looking into it and save your own sanity don't say a goddamn word and run like hell before they gaslight you to the point of suicidal. \nThey make the word Satan seem like a baby show on TV... You don't know what true absolute evil is until you encounter these peoples actions on the regular and how analytically sneakily evil they truly are.  They will eventually take off that mask and you will be trapped and they will likely never let go either until they sucked your entire life force and do yourself in or you wise up enough to run like hell....

They may hit their depression point (happens when they are forced to face the truth they are not the greatest thing in the world they are the worst...) and seem like they have changed dramatically, they are making effort and actually do love you after all.... Wrong. Your betrayal of their idealized self will be punished, They bite your head off like a praying mantis and throw you out and never even think twice about it again. Then they use some illogical blame shifting nonsense against you, lie to the world and state you are the abuser all along and use that to get sympathy of others to sink their talons into some person with lots of empathy and wants to help them. They'll replace you with that new supply who doesn't know what hell they just walked into....\n\nThey are like a bucket of water with a hole in bottom. It's leaking. You can keep pouring and pouring more into it all your love and effort and energy until you have nothing... It still leaked out the bottom. And when you run out then why do they need you? New cup to the rescue and certain doom! \n\n\nFuck these people. \nPersonality disorders or not....\nManipulation and abuse is a choice and if someone feels victimized by you then please eat \ud83d\udca9 and \ud83d\ude35",

Sometimes it is pretty obvious that someone is disabled but uneducated strangers think they are faking it because of stereotypes. Some people think disabled people can't travel on their own or need help for everything. It's even worse when the disabled person is 'young', because people tend to assume that they are 'too young' to be disabled even though there are so many disabled people who were born with it, or sometimes, unfortunate circumstances cause them to be disabled. One of my ex-colleagues became disabled after a bus knocked her down, crushing her legs and feet, she worked hard to regain mobility on her legs but she can't walk or stand for long periods of time and usually requires a walking stick. Her disability would be obvious if she didn't cover up her legs, but the stares and whispers she gets from people when she doesn't cover up aren't worth it because it is stressful to listen to random strangers discussing about the scars you get from such a traumatising event. Sometimes people accuse my blind friends of faking it for the tiniest reasons, like 'oh you can use phones, you aren't blind' even though there are special functions for disabled people on modern mobile phones. They assume that blind people who can navigate themselves are faking it, even though blind people usually get trained by disabled organisations or special teachers on life skills, including how to travel around alone.",

He chose the pain management as we were little kids, he became a disabled SAHD. \n\nBecause of how young he was/is he cops a lot of crap from oldies for parking in disability spots (in Australia old people automatically get the disability sticker/card) and in response to their, oftentimes quite awful verbal and sometimes almost borderline physical abuse, he will drool and smack himself when walking to and from the car. This will make them automatically ignore his age but also not makes them question why someone who was obviously that \"disabled\" would be driving... Says a lot about their idea of visible disability.\n\nAlso used to do it when my sister's boss questioned why he could walk when he picked her up once, so he used to purposefully play it up more whenever he saw the woman, I genuinely think this woman believed my dad had a learning disability but never questioned why he was allowed to drive... I hate the judgement, but the way he showed the insidious side of \"oh he's obviously disabled\" just was hilarious, and helped me become more confident in calling the nasty crusty oldies out when a mate needed a temp one during her pregnancy when her knee blew out, because she was actually obviously using aids and stuff so it's not like it was \"just young people being rude\" she had a walker!",

Mom pulled my medical papers and everything and applied like the docs and surgeon wanted and was denied cause they didn\u2019t \u201csee how I was disabled and parents could afford my care. Even now after trying every way I could find to work and arranging rides. Since I can\u2019t safely drive with risk of seizures well driving. People convinced me to try applying again and they turned me down. Saying they don\u2019t see how I am disabled cause I can walk and do basic things like feed myself and bath myself and am not blind. Most people look at me and think I am really smart and health and are shocked when I tell them my issues. Cause they can\u2019t see my issues. That doesn\u2019t make them any less of an issue for me. Parents wanted a handicap plate for me. As when I would have seizures in stores when I was small. It was hard for them to get me out and to the car and to the hospital or home. When the cars clear cross the lot. Mine are reflex and can be deadly if not handled properly. Yet some how \u201cI am not disabled\u201d",

They're also closer to the facility of interest to reduce travel distance. Wheelchair-bound, MS, broken bones/casts, arthritis etc. are all sorts of disabilities that could mean that you need extra space between car door to car door so you can have that extra space of motion.\n\nHeart/lung diseases, cardiovascular or muscular diseases which prevent the person from walking long distances could also mean that a disabled car spot is actually needed (say if other car parks require you to walk up a steep hill)\n\nHowever, some diseases (and this is in a general sense; there are always exceptions) such as autism, anxiety, depression, or diabetes, in which the person is not affected in a mobility sense to enter/exit their car or the building,  shouldn't be using a disabled car parking spot.\n\nIn Australia, and many other countries, you **have** to apply for a disabled car parking permit in order to gain a little tag you stick on your dash and therefore be allowed to use a disabled car parking spot without getting a $500 fine (as seen in this video)\n\nI know everyone will hate me for this, but i just wanted to write this because personally, in my own **PERSONAL OPINION**, not all disabilities should qualify for use of a disabled car parking spot. *Fin.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDisclaimer: I'm not saying the elderly lady in the video shouldn't be using it. I am not invalidating her disability. She clearly has a disability in which she needs to use it, therefore why she has a permit.",

I have MS, one day I was having a pretty rough time with spasticity (involuntary movements) so my daughter suggested I use the mobility cart at the grocery store so I didn't have to try so hard to walk properly or keep up with her walking. My daughter had to go to the service counter so I rode around produce and a young woman felt it was her business to question why I needed to use the mobility cart, because it didn't \"look\" like I was disabled (I'm a really young looking 43) and stood in front of me so I couldn't move forward. I was pretty annoyed already because of my MS acting up so she pushed my buttons at the wrong time, I'm not very nice to rude people in general. I told her I found her rude, annoying and her opinion on what a disability looked like was worthless. I backed the cart up (which beeps loudly) told her to please move before she ended up disabled as well. So she put her foot on the front of the cart to try and stop me from going. So I put my hand on the gas handle, looked her in the eyes and said don't try me and gave the gas a quick jerk forward so she almost fell backwards. By that time the security guard noticed she was harassing me (I used to work there) and made her leave the store. I'm a pretty feisty person so no big deal to me, but I can imagine how much a situation like that would be difficult for someone who's meek.",

You can report the car to your local authorities if you want (make sure they don't have a placard first), but even then, just butt out. Some people are inconsiderate jerks who do use the disabled spot even when they don't have permission to do so, but a confrontation will do nothing and you might be harassing someone who actually is disabled but you don't see the placard at first glance.  \n\nI remember the case of Michael Drejka who ended up shooting a guy after an argument over a parking spot. Drejka was walking around the parked car of Markeis McGlockton who was inside a convenience store while his girlfriend was parked in a disabled space. McGlockton came out of the store to find Drejka yelling at his girlfriend and he pushed Drejka down to the pavement. Drejka pulled out his gun and shot McGlockton in the back as the latter was retreating. A man is dead, 3 children are without a father and the other guy is in jail for 20 years. All over an argument over a parking space. It's not worth it.",

I just looked at him confused as I opened the car door for my brother (20). He can walk but he also has juvenile arthritis in his legs angles, rusts and hands , that dude shut up and left\n\nAbleism is rampant and vile out here.

We came back to our friend arguing with a random woman about her parking in the handicap spot when she was clearly not disabled. There was 4 HC parking spots, the remaining 3 was available but this random woman still wanted to make a scene. \n\nMe and our friend came over, my friend in a walker, looking really sick and fragile, and my friend calmly said \"Lady, why are you yelling at my driver?\". The woman tried back paddling talking about how kids playing pokemon would park there and people missusing the system etc etc and she was just standing up for disabled people. My friend pointed out that it would not have cost her a single calorie to walk up to the front of the car and see the HC parking card for herself before shouting at a stranger, and this was not standing up for anyone, this was just her beeing a bitch.

I live on a street with tight parking, and there is a young (30s) woman who works at a local business at the end of my street. She has stuck a note on my car and the cars of others in my street, saying that we shouldn't park out the front of our own houses, and we should let customers (of the shop she works at) park on the street instead. (This is despite all residents having a permit that allows us to park anywhere on the entire block). The note was not a request, it was a demand, and used capital letters and exclamation marks. Her actual motive was parking her own car on the street. A few months after that the same person posted letters in residents letter boxes asking to buy a parking permit. (Illegal). She has now resorted to placing a disabled permit haphazardly on her dashboard and parking all day where she wants. Parking inspectors roam the streets all day but wont touch her car. I am friends with someone who knows her well, and he confirmed that she doesn't have a disability at all, and is instead using the permit allocated to her parent. I contacted the council but they just put it in the too hard basket. Often residents have nowhere to park because she is taking up space. The video here is fucked up, but there are people who break the rules.",

The masked man was in his 50s/60s and the mask less man was in his 20s. Turns out the man had a medical exemption from it, I don\u2019t know what and I never cared to ask but I remember it resulted in the police coming. But the man just saw the other man not wearing a mask and assumed that he was just being inconsiderate when he himself didn\u2019t know the full facts.\n\nAlso just on the off chance people see this. I am not trying to debate whether we should or shouldn\u2019t wear masks. Just stating a story of similar circumstance.",

My dad was in so much pain from walking that small distance, it ruined the whole trip for him, all he wanted was to get out of the house a bit and eat at a restaurant. \n\nI didnt want to leave my dad (the ahole was aggressive) and I couldn't make my dad walk back to the car to get the disabled card to show to the ahole, and my dad was already exhausted from walking through the carpark he just said, leave it. \n\nBeing able to walk doesnt mean someone is not disabled. My dads problem was in his hips and legs but it could be anything. There are a lot of invisible disabilities, I dont understand how people can be this ignorant. But they are.",

The majority of the public are more than willing to accept the need to accommodate people in a wheelchair or someone who is blind because they see themselves as decent people and would like to think that they live in a society that helps disabled people.  But not all disabilities are right there to see.\n\nWhen it comes to the \"invisible\" disabilities, the really impairing disabilities that aren't immediately visible, people are just as judgmental and dismissive of those individuals as they were of *cripples* and *idiots* in the early/mid 20th Century.  Autism?  Bah!  Just a child misbehaving!  Chronic depression?  Stop feeling sorry for yourself!  A homeless man with untreated schizophrenia? Must be a drunk!  In a country that pretends to support its veterans, it's shameful how many people dismiss and how many veterans kill themselves due to PTSD. \n\nBut the girl in the video doesn't give a shit about people with disabilities.  She revealed it early on when she complained that disabled parking spaces mean other people (i.e. her) need to park further away.  She cares about her own convenience and wants to cloak that pure selfishness under the idea that she cares about disability rights.\n\nFuck her.",

That day, every normal spot she would have parked in was taken, but hey, the handicap space was open. And wouldn't she be in luck, because her brother has a false leg (lost it in a motorcycle accident which is crazy on it own because the guy was a mountain of a man and was indestructible everywhere else). So they park, and start unloading groceries. Her brother takes in a couple of bags and this guest comes out SCREAMING about how dare she do this to him, he has diabetes and can't walk the long distance he had to now and how he was going to get her fired. Never let her get a word in to explain the situation or offer to move her car now that her brother was inside the unit. \n\nShe was shook, and told the GM of the resort what happened and man did she let the guest have it. I think if she could have, she would have kicked him out for that stay. The guest was lucky that her brother wasn't with her when he started talking to her either, because he would have absolutely lit him up like a Christmas tree. \n\nFuck people like him and this idiot who think they have ANY idea what someone is going through or what their situation is.",

Sometimes it is not apparent, but it is important for anyone in need. Some of us can't walk long distances without a very disturbing pain. So, just be kind to one another. Let the authorities judge what is right or wrong. People shouldn't try to take on their own hands... This often leads to injustice more than it should.

      "text": "PSA: Blue zones (in CA) aren't just for those with disabilities. They can also be for people caring for people with disabilities or illnesses. \n\nIf you have a blue card or license plate the person you are caring for doesn't even need to be present when you park in a blue zone. If you are running an errand for the owner of the blue card you are allowed to park in a blue zone with the card. \n\nReal life example: I was a caretaker for someone with terminal cancer. I have the capacity to easily walk across a parking lot. They had the capacity to walk as well. They were still approved for a blue card by their doctor and the DMV. To run errands, I often had to leave them behind; either at home to rest or in treatment or at an appointment. They would, often times, not be at my side when I was running errands for them. \n\nHad someone confronted me they'd be partially right - I am not a person with a disability. At the time I was in my early twenties  But as a caretaker it is within my legal right to use the blue parking card for these reasons. Plus there are good reasons for why people have advocated for caretakers to have that legal right. If you've been in that position then you know why it's needed. \n\nYou really never know the situation for why someone has that card.\n\nTLDR: A caretaker can park in blue zones with a blue card even if the person with disabilities isn't with them.",

While I have led a relatively assimilated lifestyle, the birth defect hasn't been without years of being called peg leg, and self-consciousness.

If, for example, you lost the use of your hands due to an accident you are clearly disabled, probably even at a 100% level. You're *still* not allowed to use the disabled parking slots because you can clearly walk normally without problem.\n\nOn the other hand, of course, not every mobility problem is visible, so asking for the disability card if you think someone is blocking the space for others who might need it might feel like a dick move but is legitimate ... IF you know how to read the card.",

Also, they were a different color if it was temporary, such as due to an injury. So people may be temporarily disabled and use a placard as they recover and regain their mobility. \n\n In order to get a placard, you had to get a note from a doctor and, while it might be possible to cheat the system, it's super rare and also not worth it just for a closer parking spot.

Physically he's fully capable... however mentally he is not, he has autism and is an extreme flight risk with no sense of personal safety, ie without hesitation he'd run right into traffic. We have double sided deadbolts with autolocking mechanism on every external door at home, he got out once and we ended up calling the police in less than 5 min, after they found him it took 2 officers to hold him until i got there to put him in his seat... So it's very important we either get into a building quickly with doors, or he's in his chair with his 5 point harness, etc. I often carry him myself, he's a 60lb+ 8 year old and I can't do that forever... I've requested at airports that we board early and been hassled by airline staff as well as other passengers.. like I'm trying to sneak on the plane to sit there while my son screams bloody murder (he hates sitting still) due to entitlement or some BS... it's demeaning and infuriating but there really are people like this. I could care less about what other people think, but it makes it much more emotionally draining when you have to deal with people who don't believe disabilities exist because you can't see them. \n\nOn another note, I also see people who don't have the placard who pull into handicap spots to run into Starbucks almost everyday.\n\nEdit: I will add that 1 time our AA plane was delayed and we went back to the gate, the pilot came and spoke with me because it was clear my son was not having a good time as we were sitting still stuck for about an hour at the gate. He told the flight attendants and the gate personnel to let me and my son use the gate walkway with the door in the airport locked (at my request) all we wanted but no one else was allowed to de-plane. I don't think that man knew how much that meant to me even though I thanked him.",

If you're not exposed to it, then you're not going to understand even a fraction of what it is to be disabled, and the complexities and nuances when it comes to the multitude of conditions that can impact people's lives. I'm 30. When going to school, I was forced to hide it my disabilities and go without my mobility aids (I use a cane, a wheelchair or a walker, and can go without all of them for brief periods of time, but it absolutely sucks ass) because other kids teased the shit out of me for it, and the school didn't have accommodations.\n\nWhere I am, a 'blue badge' or disability parking permit can be issued for a HUGE number of reasons, including:\n\n- An autistic child that needs the car close in the event of a meltdown, and requires full parental support for things like walking, buckling up, guidance, etc. Having a wide disability parking spot means the child is in less danger in a traffic setting.\n\n- Amputations of limbs that impact your ability to walk or function. A lot of the time, as folks have mentioned, you can't actually see these due to amazing prosthetics and clothing.\n\n- Neurological conditions that mean you need extra space or support getting in or out of your car, or shopping. Things like Parkinsons or MS seriously impact fine motor skills and your ability to self-manage at times, and the specific spots mean you're less likely to hurt yourself while getting in and out, or dealing with shopping, as well as closer distances to locations.\n\n- Chronic pain conditions that impact the amount of movement you can take without injuring yourself further. This doesn't just mean breaking bones, but conditions like EDS mean your ligaments, tendons and muscles simply don't work as they should, and movements can cause tears, dislocations and huge amounts of fatigue as you're required to hold yourself together.\n\n- Cardiac issues that cause a person to be low on energy or short on breath, and can be hugely impacted by excessive activity.\n\n- Wheelchair and mobility aid users (for whatever reason) who need extra space either with an electric lift on the back of the car, or manual assistance at the passenger doors.\n\nAt the end of the day, I know it feels right to try and enforce the use of these spots, but as you can see above, there are so many reasons that someone might use one of these spots, that aren't immediately visible. And harassment, threats and abuse are just another thing we have to put up with on a near daily basis because people like the woman in the video think that they're doing the right thing.\n\nIf you're concerned about someone parking where they shouldn't, the best thing to do is contact your local law enforcement and let them handle it.",

Wheelchair for many months, then knee scooter, crutches and then physio to learn how to walk again. She would get this so often that she refused to use disabled parking unless I was with her. \n\nPeople wouldn't even check the front of the car before calling us out. Personally, i enjoyed it a bit. It's not often you get to have an argument that you 100% know you will win, with the other party being very embarrassed and sometimes even apologizing. \n\nThey would lecture and rant and I would let them and barely speak other to say i don't understand why you think we shouldn't park here, until they run out of steam. Then I simply showed them the badge, explained that my partner is disabled and people like you are making her disability magnitudes worse for her.",

While there were on my car the disable card easy to spot. I usually do not care about rude people, It is a waste of time, but this time I couldnt because I know the relative of mine how much work he putted and he still does to these days to appear \"normal\". So I took the disable card in my palm, and I slapped him so hard that he felt down. I shouldnt, but I was too livid for what he said. When he saw that he just walked away without saying anything more. \n\nI hate people like him that without any knowledge or background feel entitle to harass people that rightly have the right to use that spot.

That's a disabled space for disabled people. People like me. I've fought in wars. Show some respect\"... and so on...\n\nMum looked him straight in the face and asked him about his service... you could see him getting all proud and self centred as he listed off his resume... until mum said \"oh no way me too!\" And asked him his base etc and then described it in detail...\n\nShe then proceeded to explain that she was injured in service and it left her physically disabled (legs).\n\nThe switch this guy did from stuck up self importance to apologetic was shocking... I'll never forget it... reminded me that we don't just *have to* respect our elders, we should respect everyone (even those younger)... we don't know peoples lives and they don't know ours...\n\nThe gorl in this video needs to go to hell...

Many times there were morons who complained that \u201cno one is using it anyway\u201d or whatever, but often they go and park somewhere else. \n\nOfc it has happened a few times I addressed people who had a disability. Those times they usually show me the card and say they are allowed, in which I always appologize. Every time that happened, they all were very thankful for me (of me?) for doing that. \nOfc, in comparison to this lady in the video, I know that disability does not equal not walking alone. Im both glad she says something, but horrified that she goes that far without even acknowledging her limited knowledge over disabilities. It would have been a good moment for her to learn more, but she really made an idiot of herself. Hopefully that older lady isn\u2019t taking it personal and feels bad about her disability.",

I've had people pretend to hold doors open only to slam them in my face, Ive had people try to kick the cane away from me, countless \"You're not disabled!\" from strangers....\n\nYeah, I can physically walk. I have a birth defect in my skull that restricts my spine and causes pain and fatigue. I'm very prone to heat stroke and absence seizures. The cane helps relieve pressure from my spine.\n\nBut on the outside I just look like a thin woman. People interpret the malnourishment as dieting. It is literally impossible to see my disabilities without medical imaging. So strangers think I'm faking, get offended by benefits that I do not receive (disability is very hard to get on) and decide I need to be \"taught a lesson\".\n\nNote the woman's language; \"while all of us have to park over here\" - because the person *looks* unlike the image of a disabled person in her head, she has decided she does not deserve the \"special treatment\". She resents her because she has to park farther from the store than her, despite *never being able to park in that spot, regardless of if the woman was there*, and decides to harass her about it. She is angered by the existence of someone able to use the disabled parking.\n\nI've taken to wearing a back brace under my clothes, which helps, but it's not the cane and eventually I will *need* to use it. This is a viral video, but this interaction happens daily with any disabled person when they venture in public. Harassment for harassment's sake under the guise of wokeness.\n\nEdit; gender, didn't watch with sound oops.\n\nEdit 2; after about 30 seconds of this I'd just start actually banshee screeching at her. I'm so over \"uh IM DOING THE RIGHT THING BY YELLING AT A DISABLED PERSON\" that I'm just gonna actually screech at the next one, I've decided this.",

I still take public transport, and it is hard and painful, but it is only for a few minutes.

She had her disability card on her, her disability wasn't necessarily visible to everyone, but she had the card, it was issued by a doctoral committee, who am I to say anything? So, this guy goes on about how I should have the spot, that she should get up and give it to me. Umm... No? I don't have a disability card, my current situation is only temporary, and I'm getting off in two stops anyway. If someone else wants to give me their spot, I'll be happy to accept and say thank you, but I'm not talking a spot from someone who has a real disability, whether she can walk or not.\n\nOn a side note, this accident has been eye-opening. In general, people are much nicer to me on transport and in the shops, but as soon as you get to a checkout queue, you become completely invisible, and no-one ever looks at you, in case they must give up their spot.",

Ever since then he always has a cane with him because his back sometimes hurts and he needs something to help him.\n\nAt  the security lanes in front of six flags the lady told him he couldn't take it inside because he looked like he didn't need it and it could be used as a weapon, he told the lady that he did need it and the lady still said \"it could be used as a weapon\" we got in after my dad and the rest of us went off on how stupid it was that he can't use his cane. After a little bit of this awkward situation that was turning some heads we got in, but we had security following us the whole time. we could see the same two guys following us made us uncomfortable we figured they were security because they followed us to the gates and always kept there distance while they watched us.\n\nAnd I know your gonna ask yes we did go two times prior to this and they let us in no problem, but I'm never going back \" tbh I'm scared of most of the rides anyways\" but that kind of experience ruined it for me.\n\nEdit: spelling :P",

The cartilage in my knees started showing signs of wear by the second deployment by making small pops and progressively got worse. My Dr. says I need both my knees replaced if I want to walk long distances and workout like I used to, but I\u2019m not ready to go down that road just yet unless I\u2019m at a daily ten in the pain scale (currently at a tolerable 5) And that\u2019s just one of my non visible misfortunes.\n\n\n\n\nI bump into these people all the time and just ignore them since I have nothing to prove to them.

All I do is calmly state that isn\u2019t what you just go around asking someone being that he could be sued because they\u2019re in the process of violating the HIPAA act. \n\n\n\nI just point to my lil wheelchair dude in the placard and say that should be enough.

Instead of being self-righteous brat and creating a scene, I'd have minded my business but one feeling would have lingered during that time - what a lazy asshole you have to be to take up a disabled parking spot! To say of now, I'd now come to realize that disabilities can be present in all sorts- visible or invisible.

      "text": "It seems that there are a lot of well-meaning people who spend a bunch of time being offended on other people\u2019s behalf.\n\nThis is just an observation, not a judgment so bear with me.\n\nIn my people-watching experience, there are a ton of white people who preach about the pitfalls of being black. There are a ton of straight people who preach about the difficulties that people of other orientations face. There are a ton of able people who are warriors for the disabled. I am even seeing a modest yet increasing number of men who are outspoken for women\u2019s rights. Then there are people who have never been abused or assaulted who stand up against abuse and assault.\n\nAll this is incredibly important, and it should be happening. It is a good sign.\n\nHowever, I have observed many people going so overboard about it, to the point that they are clearly talking about something they don\u2019t fully understand. And sometimes it seems that some of these people take these injustices and treat them as though THEY themselves are the victim.\n\nThat is where I begin to cringe, because as someone who has experienced having my issues commandeered by another for their own emotional gain, it pains me to see a person who has never been damaged in a certain way acting as though they have.\n\nIt also happens at times, as is demonstrated in this video, that the \u2018I get it\u2019 people make a stink about things that the people whom they are arguing on behalf of would not take issue with.\n\nI am betting people with disabilities probably get (at least to a greater extent than this lady) that there are different levels of disability and various reasons for needing to park up front. Many of us here realize that maybe someone with COPD might get winded walking from the back of the parking lot, someone with a brain tumor or seizure disorder, vision impairment, chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, recent surgery, or pregnant women on modified bed rest have a need that is not easily seen. Granted, someone with vision impairment or a seizure disorder probably shouldn\u2019t be driving, but they often go places accompanied by an able driver, and that does not eliminate their need to park up front.\n\nWhen I took my grandmother to her appointments, she had a mirror tag and we used my sporty car. But if I decided to sit in the car on a phone call while she was at her appointment, you can bet I was met with some looks. Of course I usually would avoid that scenario and just walk around the building to make my calls, but on a cold rainy day that is a crummy thing to deal with. Yeah I could drive somewhere else and give up the spot, but then I don\u2019t have the spot when my grandmother needs to return to the car...\n\nWell that trailed off on a tangent a bit, but I guess my point is that if someone is going to be offended on behalf of someone else, at least try to get it right and don\u2019t add embarrassment to the world dialogue on the matter. \n\nSay, for example, a white person is arguing about race issues with someone who said something bigoted. If they make extreme or ridiculous statements, all that does is cement in the other person\u2019s mind how right they are.\n\nGetting it wrong does more harm than good.",

I didnt think it was impossible for him to say Polio but it was basically the bottom of the list. \n\nGenerally we dont feel like discussing our medical history with random strangers we'll never see again- especially if they're being all Karen-like.",

Like he could have literally parked 10 feet away and not used up a wheelchair spot. \n\nThere needs to be a two tier system; Wheelchair users only and then people that can walk but still have issues. \n\nI saw one slim older gent use up a wheelchair bay, blue badge and all, get out with his cane and it never even touched the ground, he was swinging it back and forth while striding forth.",

He showed me his leg and he was screaming that he had a surgery. \n\nI just said \"Okay, I'm sorry. However, you should be happy that I'm guarding your right to park there by asking people that has no permits or signs on their cars not to park that spot.\"\n\nHe erupted.\n\nSo instead of all that bullshit, the ancient lady could just say that I'm disabled and this is the sign that says I can park here. End of story.\n\nAnd it is logical to ask someone if he/she is disabled if they are using privileges for the disabled. It's not for being rude. It is for safeguarding their rights.\n\nBut no. They would have lost the chance to record a video for the internet points. Sigh.",
