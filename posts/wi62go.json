We are the last country to keep our guns and when our government eventually loses its shit and comes after its people (they've been going down that path in recent years) there is no one coming to help us and nowhere for us to run. If you think it's a good idea to give up our guns in the name of safety, please remember what the US government did to the Indians after they gave up their guns in the name of safety and protection and you can also look at what happened to the undesirables in Germany and the Soviet Union after they gave up their guns. It never ends up well for people, especially in times of an economic crisis. Why is the government pushing for gun control? It's not going to do much with the criminals with guns so why are they coming as our government has been trending towards totalitarianism little by little? \n\nIt also doesn't help that a lot of the left doesn't know dick about the guns they want to ban. Either ban them all from literally everyone even the government, police, and military, or don't ban them at all. Because if you do end up banning them it might not be you who is subjugated, but it might really be your grandkids or great-grandchildren. \n\nLastly, why does our IRS have so many fucking guns and ammunition? Why the hell do they need that?",
