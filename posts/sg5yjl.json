  "text": "TIFU by silencing my wife\u2019s phone.\n\nMy wife went out with work friends tonight. I knew she would be back late but stayed up anyway just in case she needed to be picked up or whatever. Well she rolled in about 1:30 drunk af. I promptly turn off the movie I\u2019m watching and we head to bed. I barely have time to get undressed before she says goodnight and rolls over. Now this struck me as odd because this woman gets RIDICULOUSLY horny when she been drinking. But I guess not tonight. Rather frustrated I climb into bed and try to write it off as her just being over tired and over served. Well I\u2019m just about asleep when her phone loudly goes off startling me back into consciousness. Seeing no reaction from her, and knowing her notification will go off at least one more time unless it is dealt with, I reach over and grab it to flip the silent mode button. And here\u2019s where shit gets fucked up. You see the notification was triggered by a text. A text from a guy who picked her up tonight, from some other random guys house bc random guy was super drunk and she was scared. His text, \u201cGoodnight darling.\u201d \n\nWhat followed was me doing what I\u2019ve never done, but obviously should have, a deep dive into her phone activity. What I found is as follows: she\u2019s fucked at least one of my, now former, friends. She is involved in an emotional affair with a friend of hers from college (also married) who seemed VERY eager to take advantage of his wife\u2019s absence so that he could spend time with mine (He was the noble knight who rescued her from rando drunk guy) And she has an impressively active tinder profile. Oh yeah and at one point this evening it seems she briefly considered hitching a ride with a stranger to Colorado. The texts, snaps and dms took about an hour to get through. \n\nSo now I\u2019m sitting here, house quiet, nauseous and internally raging, drinking cheap beer, trying to figure out how we got here. I\u2019d wake her up to confront her, but the kids are asleep and I just don\u2019t have the energy to fight tonight. There\u2019s 6 years down the fuckin drain bois.\n\nTL;DR - Found out my wife\u2019s been fucking other dudes when I tried to silence her notifications.\n\nEdit: Just wanted to say thank you to everyone for the kind words of support and mostly sound advise. Y\u2019all are the best.\n\nUpdate: Since I\u2019ve been asked a few times I\u2019ll try it on this thread. Idk if anyone will see if since it was taken down but oh well. I confronted her Sunday night. Eventually she admitted what I already knew. I assume there\u2019s more I don\u2019t know about. I got set up to start counseling next week. Broke down at the office today and left early to save myself the embarrassment of crying at work. Staying with at a friends while I figure out which way is up.",

The EPO is then good for 7 days, in which time the prosecutor usually has to either file charges or decline to file charges, and then request a formal longer term protective order.\n\nIf she was arrested and kept in custody (i.e. she didn\u2019t post bail) then she would be required to have an arraignment (usually within 48 hours), and at that arraignment then the prosecutor usually requests the longer term protective order, and the victim can provide their opinion as to the order, but then usually the judge makes the call depending on the circumstances.",

Step brother recently had broken up with his girlfriend of damn near a decade, and immediately jumped into the next relationship which was already forming during their time together. All the typical signs of cheating were there (making up excuses to see her, lies about where they were to the ex, the iconic \"don't worry about her\", etc). No *true* confirmation, but they spent alot of time together and shortly after they grabbed a hotel room because they had nowhere to sleep and lied about where they were, he broke up with the now-Ex (likely out of guilt something happened? I don't know for sure).\n\nConflicted as I was personally towards the situation (and I know I'm overwhelmingly in the wrong morally), I didn't intervene to tell the ex. Neither did anyone else in the family which we suspected it. It's... an odd position to be in. You know what's right and yet you hold out some type of reservation that \"no he can't be that stupid, can he? He's a good guy...\". Ultimately, I viewed it as their business but, if asked, I wouldn't lie about anything I'd had speculated. And yes, again to reiterate, I know I'm a terrible person for going about it that way.\n\nAll that is to say to OP: If they're good friends with both of you, don't assume they didn't know. It's much safer to assume they did know or atleast had an idea.",

Typically, one of the two partners has not noticed what was going on, and very often that is due in part to their personality type.\n\nI'm not advocating being either a controlling type, or suggesting that her behavior is acceptable.\n\nAll I'm saying that is that there is a reason why you did not notice this kind of behavior which apparently has been going on for some time - and frequently personality types tie into it.\n\nIf you look at this objectively, and depending on your age, it could actually be a positive thing for you, as it will allow you to find the right person - someone who will treat you  (and your family) with more respect (as it should be).  The worst thing you can do in life is waste your time - because, trust me, the ride is much, much shorter than you think it is.\n\nThat's all I'm saying.

Or did the strippers go with Clinton and Biden, meaning at least four people went to the store (Clinton, Biden, and multiple strippers)?\n\nThe issue here is that as it's written, the word \"lawyer\" seems to be an object of the preposition \"for\" instead of an object of \"into.\" I mean, it could be read the other way: \"into counseling for yourself and [into] a lawyer, but without a second \"into,\" it's awkward and ambiguous. It could be more clearly written by moving \"lawyer\" closer to its intended object: \"look into getting a lawyer and counseling for yourself.\"",

Once she knew the gig was up, she tried to take house, cars, money, kid, etc. The best part, all the lawyers told her she could eat a bag of dicks. I moved on. Have had shared custody with one of the best kids ever. Found the partner of my dreams. Have a successful career. Etc. Meanwhile, her boss/boyfriend told her to get lost once his wife found out... wife took him for everything. My ex has never moved on. Miserable. No partner. Limited money. No job (only wanted the old job back she blew). Sits around blaming everybody else for her situation. Zero accountability.\n\nYou'll be good bud. It took me a year or so to work the back half out.

It was so fucking strange. I don't understand it to this day. Luckily, my dad still ended up with custody of us. He was not perfect but he never did anything like that.",

My ex and I had a big vacation in plan. I had put a solid chunk of money into it as it was going to be abroad etc. During mediation this line item come up for consideration as we were dividing shared assets etc. My ex asked about it. Obviously I had canceled everything. Though I immediately walked into a jewelry store and purchased myself a fucking Rolex. I'm not the kind of person to do something like this. But I felt I deserved something for myself in the moment... Especially considering she was on her bosses dick. And had all the jewelry, her own Rolex (I gave her), etc. Anyhow. When she asks about the vacation monies (mediation happened in person back then) I lifted my arm and very smugly introduced her to my new watch. The mediator had to hold back her smile. The look of disappointment on my ex's face was fucking priceless. My ex even told me later in the process that that move was well played on my part. She actually admired it. 100% felt good in the moment. 100% not on the list. 100% would do it again... And anytime I put that watch on, I wear it with more pride than you can imagine.",

Because as soon as she knows you're loading up on legal ammunition, there's a very good chance she will close off any opportunity she can for you to learn or know anything to help your case.\n\nA huge help when I went through basically the same thing (our son was just over 1yo), she was doing all sorts of drugs, partying, sleeping around for fun and for drugs,  stopped paying bills, and completely failing as a mother. She thought I was doing just the bare minimum to get by, and that I wasn't going to be able to have any legal footing against her. \n\nWell 5 months later I dropped a bomb. She was served. She thought this was a basic \"let's go to court, have custody on paper, and be done of it.. thing was... my lawyer and I had already gone through a smallish phone book worth of paper evidence. Texts and stuff between us, texts and recordings of our mutual friends proving all she was doing, pictures, letter from her landlord (we both lived in the same block of apartments) and when she was evicted, there was a loophole regarding an abandoned cat in the apartment which ended with my now wife going in with the landlord and animal control as a witness, taking pictures of everything\n\n\n5, almost 6 years later, I've had sole custody for years now, with no contact whatsoever or visitation for almost 4 years now. Yes, I believe a child should have both their parents in their lives for sure! Which is why we also offered supervised visitation to her, with the chance that if it went well, it could be more frequent, etc. But she visited twice and then disappeared into the wonderful world of meth without a trace, so it is what it is.\n\n\nBasically, OP I'm sorry all this is happening, and it's an absolute PILE of stressful stuff to keep track of. Just remember to take a breath, make time to sit and review, and plan/execute things in the smartest way possible. Don't even send her a text without thinking about wording, context etc and how if this interaction was somehow brought up in court or whatever,  that it's not going to bite you in the ass in any way shape or form\n\nBe careful. Be smart. And be cool, calm, collected, and wise through all this",

She\u2019s been stealing from me (also her friends, family, stores etc.) so I had to change the locks, but I rented a mobile storage unit, parked it outside the house, and moved all of her stuff into it. Gave her she had a month to grab her stuff from it., at her convenience. I probably spent half my time with my lawyer reiterating that I had no desire to be punitive, or seek revenge, but I\u2019d fight if she made me (thankfully she didn\u2019t; though she tried to bury her head in the sand and pretend the divorce could just happen with no work on her part. She claimed she didn\u2019t have enough money for a lawyer, even just for an hour so he could witness her signing the documents, so I had my lawyer contact her affair partner and got him to pay. NGL, that was fun.)\n\nI feel for the OP. The year(s) ahead are going to be hard.

You're surrendering a large portion of your claim to the house, which is usually a couple's largest asset.  \"Possession is 9/10 of the law\" and all that. It's much easier to assert a claim to a house that you currently legally occupy than one that you don't.\n\n2. Assuming the children still live in the house, you're abandoning them. Simply by moving out, you're abdicating everyday parenting duties, and that will reflect poorly on you in custody arguments.\n\n3. Cynically, you're also allowing your soon-to-be-ex to craft whatever narrative they want in the kids' minds.  It's a lot easier to sell \"Daddy/Mommy left us\" and poison that relationship when one party has literally left the house.",

You're surrendering a large portion of your claim to the house, which is usually a couple's largest asset.  \"Possession is 9/10 of the law\" and all that. It's much easier to assert a claim to a house that you currently legally occupy than one that you don't. 2. Assuming the children still live in the house, you're abandoning them. Simply by moving out, you're abdicating everyday parenting duties, and that will reflect poorly on you in custody arguments. 3. Cynically, you're also allowing your soon-to-be-ex to craft whatever narrative they want in the kids' minds.  It's a lot easier to sell \"Daddy/Mommy left us\" and poison that relationship when one party has literally left the house.",

There are also many other factors that will come into consideration w/ division of all assets including the house etc. This is why some people do prenuptial agreements when they get married. Especially if the partners enter the marriage with disproportionate assets. In my case, we did not have shit when we started, so when we split, it was all on the table to consider.",

Even if no-fault is assigned for the divorce, alimony and assets can often be divided differently based on whose \"fault\" the divorce was. I know from a lawyer friend that in CA, the worst thing a stay-at-home parent can do is cheat on their spouse or cause alienation through their actions because the alimony will almost always be reduced to the absolute legal minimum instead of using the discretionary calculations the courts prefer (because the legal minimum is regarded as too low by them). Similarly, if the non-stay-at-home parent causes the marriage to collapse, courts will often award even more alimony and give preference in asset division to the other party. Also, just because the law says that assets will be split 50/50, that doesn't mean the valuation of the assets is well known. The judge can easily agree to take the lower valuation of items being given by one party over the valuation given by the other party based on how they feel about the case.",

                              "text": "I got a divorce in a no-fault state (Indiana) in an eerily similar situation to this one.\n\nIt sucks because your life changes drastically because of their actions and there's nothing you can do about it. Even worse, if the cheater is the breadwinner, you could be screwed because the division of assets will be pretty close to a 50-50 split in most cases. \n\nHowever, keeping that information could be important depending on the state. It is clear she has bad judgment and there are kids involved. While I don't advocate for taking people's children away from them because they are a whore, I'd be willing to bet that this narcissist is going to go for primary custody. That is something he can fight if he truly wants primary custody of the children.\n\nAlso, even in no-fault states, there can be exceptions for things like alimony. I don't have children, but if I had, I would have hesitated to put my children through a child support battle. However, there's NO FUCKING WAY I would pay my ex-spouse a dime in spousal support if I didn't have to.\n\nFinally, chronic liars and narcissists lie A LOT. They also think they're super smart and everyone else is super dumb. My ex thought he could lie to everyone else, including his lawyer, about why our marriage was ending. His lawyer made REALLY STUPID DECISIONS because of that. I mean we're talking they made such monumental stupid decisions on wanting to leave me with NOTHING that fault actually could be introduced into a no-fault state divorce proceeding. It forced him to settle out of court... and that's what you want. You never know which way a judge will decide the divorce. Keeping that information would definitely help in a situation like this.\n\nIf the OP is reading this, I'm so sorry for you. This is going to be a painful journey. I wish there was something I could say that would make you feel better. Here are my two cents, for what it is worth:\n\n* If you want to get divorced or if she's insistent on divorce even if you wish it wasn't happening, file quickly and let the lawyers handle this. This is for two reasons. (1) In most states, your assets will be frozen, which means any huge withdrawals of cash or movement of investments are big no-nos. If she does something like empty an IRA or run up credit card debt, she's going to be responsible or you can use that as leverage. Put a freeze on your credit too that only YOU can lift just in case she tries any shenanigans like buying a new car or home jointly with your SSN. (2) Your pain is going to be palpable. You may do stupid things to try to win her back or get revenge. Nothing you do will do that and could weaken your position. The ONLY thing to discuss with her directly is the children and their welfare. You're going to have to swallow that bitter pill to do right by them, but everything else... that's the lawyer's job. They can handle this without emotion and following the law. And get the best one you can afford. Ask around. You'd be surprised at what people have gone through and who helped them the most (or dropped the ball).\n* Stop digging around now in her affairs. There's only more heartache ahead. I thought it was just one woman. Turns out, the SOB had been cheating on me since before we were married. He may even have a child with someone else conceived in the second year of our marriage. None of this is going to give you answers and the lying narcissist will NEVER tell you the truth because it will make them look bad and hurt their fragile ego. When my ex walked out, he completely cut off all contact with me - after 15 years. I spent a lot of time wondering what I did to deserve all of this. The answer is absolutely nothing. My ex couldn't face what he had done, so that's why he never talked to me again. I even had to sue him to divorce me. A divorce that HE wanted.\n* Don't let people tell you not to feel this pain. People are going to want you to move on. Forget about the bitch, they'll say. Listen, I don't know you, but I'm sure you gave this woman your heart. She took that precious gift and shredded it. On top of that, your own friends were involved. It was the same for me. You're not going to know who to trust and that sucks. How you heal from this is up to you. I would recommend finding someone to talk to so you don't spiral, but don't think you need to just \"move on\" because people think you should. You'll find your support tribe because your true friends will show themselves.\n\nI wish you all the luck OP.",

She got berated by the judge in the courtroom for not taking marriage seriously, and then she was awarded NOTHING. She got nothing, no alimony, no money, not a piece of the house - nothing. Not a single thing other than the boxes of her stuff I left outside for her to pick up prior to the poceedings. I'm not sure I even needed to give her that but whatever. It was viewed like a breach of contract and the judge seemed very unhappy with that kind of behavior. We didn't have any kids so child support wasn't in the equation.\n\nAnd that's the story of how I had the perfect divorce.",

So when lawyers, meaning hers get involved and try to prove your incompetence, you have detailed noted of every day.\n\nThat also said, if you think she's done things at your house, however painful it might be, there are spycams you can buy (granted I don't know about their legality and usage as evidence against her).

Its best to avoid the emotional torment of eventually catching them in the act again (as evident by your family member being cheated on more than once) and cut your losses while you are ahead.\n\nI can say for myself, I believe that if I stayed in a relationship that 'allowed' cheating, it would eventually come to a breaking point for me and I would do something which no longer makes me the victim (think straw that broke the camel's back).

If you treat them like shit, they are more likely to continue their shit behavior. If you treat them well, they are less likely to repeat the behavior. Also, to head off other potential misunderstandings, never said they shouldn't be punished, but that punishment should focus on rehabilitation and therapy for what is going on that led to the maladaptive behaviors (note that I do believe that therapy and rehabilitation does not work for all offenders). Basically, we should be trying every day to make the world a better place, and one thing we can do to work towards that goal is to give unconditional positive regard.",

If it turns out to be too much to know that the kids are a product of cheating wife's lies and betrayal then thats also perfectly valid and not his fault. He would not be the one being unfair to the kids as this situation would be entirely the responsibility of the mother. You're not beholden to a child just because you've taken on a caregiver role for a few years, just as there wouldn't be an expectation that a step-dad continue to fulfill a parental role to his young step kids after leaving a relationship with their mother. Men have a right to choose whether or not to raise another person's children. Being deceived by a bad actor doesn't strip a man of that right. What you're advocating for is entrapment via emotional blackmail.",

The only difference between a step parent and a victim of parental fraud is that the step parent had informed consent when agreeing to take on a caregiver role to a child that is not their own, and they can very much wash their hands of the entire situation if the relationship ends.\n\nImagine thinking advocating for following the lead of the infamously unequal and unjust treatment of men under the family court system is a good argument. Also, ascribing your opinion to \"most uninvolved parties\" is as arrogant as it is disingenuous.\n\nTry making an argument that stands on moral or ethical grounds instead of one that relies on people being forced to submit to outdated and sexist social expectations and a precedent of injustice under the law.",

I started noticing increasing monthly and after audit realized something wasn\u2019t ok so convinced her to move all spend into individual card so we know where spend is coming from. That resulted in some clarity over time that it wasn\u2019t household but her own personal expenses nothing to do with household. She then started paying it off on her own in the side which I was ok with as it didn\u2019t come into the joint accounts but when I dig deeper there was quite a bit piling up. I dodged a bullet there. Usually folks like this don\u2019t just lead a secret life in one aspect it trickles into everything hidden cards, bank accounts, phones that you may not know off. All came out for me as I started digging deeper. Eventually the evidence was strong enough that she moved out and I got primary custody of the kids as she was in position to raise kids.",

If that's true she definitely could've stated she wanted a divorce and started the process. I promise, I'm not a robot, I made it through the captcha test. The fact that you're trying to say OP's wife cheating is okay and that it's partially on him is a trash way to gaslight. Read the comments, multiple people, probably hundreds have told OP to not up and leave.. why, because that's COMMON.\n\nAlso, I've been with my SO 10 years and have a 4 year old; I'm becoming familiar with \"life\". Reality definitely is complicated, but dealing with shitty people who are willing to cheat multiple times isn't. There will always be problems in this world but time will do just as you said, it will sail on and it will wait for no one.",

      "text": "Sounds scarily similar to what I went through 15 years ago. I handled a few things wrong. I confronted her, naively tried to work things out for the sake of the kids. Her response was to say I was delusional, paranoid and obviously had some things of my own I wanted to hide. She demanded I leave which I refused, a week later there's a knock on the door and I'm ordered by a court official to get out that day, and appear in court a few days later. She claimed repeated domestic abuse as her reason for wanting me out which came out of nowhere! Despite her having zero medical evidence of multiple alleged broken bones etc. I was advised to not fight the order to leave, to avoid any findings against me. She immediately started divorce proceedings while I was still trying to process everything, find somewhere to live with no spare income, etc. These allegations made anything I had to say about her behaviour in the marriage irrelevant, and repeatedly forgotten about even by my own lawyer due to being nothing to do with the legal fight. It was HER divorcing ME, over MY alleged behaviour! To cut a long story short, I lost the house and the life savings I'd invested in it. After a further 4 years constantly fighting in court to see my kids she managed to turn them against me with some seriously underhand tactics. They're at the end of their teens now and I've not seen/heard from them for 10 years. \n\nWhat I'd do now (with hindsight) in your shoes:\n\nDo NOTHING without getting legal advice first. Good advice in one region can be illegal in another. If nothing else, the lawyers have seen these situations, and how they pan out, countless times.\nUse your \"undercover\" time to gather more evidence. Once she knows you know you'll lose this opportunity. Local laws MAY prevent you using screenshots etc but that doesn't stop you quietly saving them in case they're useful in a non legal setting in the future (shared friends etc).\nKeep calm and rational. I know how I overwhelming this feels right now. But one day this will just be a brief period in your past, try to make it one you'll be proud of.\nAvoid the booze. I was lucky I didn't get caught up in the drinking but looking back it was a close thing. Life isn't great now but would be a while lot worse with a drink problem. Also it's just a matter of time before a drunk you acts against all advice/common sense and wrecks everything.\n\nYou're one step ahead at the moment, do everything to keep u that way and best of luck.",

I knew she would be back late but stayed up anyway just in case she needed to be picked up or whatever. Well she rolled in about 1:30 drunk af. I promptly turn off the movie I\u2019m watching and we head to bed. I barely have time to get undressed before she says goodnight and rolls over. Now this struck me as odd because this woman gets RIDICULOUSLY horny when she been drinking. But I guess not tonight. Rather frustrated I climb into bed and try to write it off as her just being over tired and over served. Well I\u2019m just about asleep when her phone loudly goes off startling me back into consciousness. Seeing no reaction from her, and knowing her notification will go off at least one more time unless it is dealt with, I reach over and grab it to flip the silent mode button. And here\u2019s where shit gets fucked up. You see the notification was triggered by a text. A text from a guy who picked her up tonight, from some other random guys house bc random guy was super drunk and she was scared. His text, \u201cGoodnight darling.\u201d \n\nWhat followed was me doing what I\u2019ve never done, but obviously should have, a deep dive into her phone activity. What I found is as follows: she\u2019s fucked at least one of my, now former, friends. She is involved in an emotional affair with a friend of hers from college (also married) who seemed VERY eager to take advantage of his wife\u2019s absence so that he could spend time with mine (He was the noble knight who rescued her from rando drunk guy) And she has an impressively active tinder profile. Oh yeah and at one point this evening it seems she briefly considered hitching a ride with a stranger to Colorado. The texts, snaps and dms took about an hour to get through. \n\nSo now I\u2019m sitting here, house quiet, nauseous and internally raging, drinking cheap beer, trying to figure out how we got here. I\u2019d wake her up to confront her, but the kids are asleep and I just don\u2019t have the energy to fight tonight. There\u2019s 6 years down the fuckin drain bois.\n\nTL;DR - Found out my wife\u2019s been fucking other dudes when I tried to silence her notifications.",

Screenshot any apps like whatsapp/Snapchat where the info isn't stored on the phone itself. If the phone is in your name or you have access, get a copy of the call records to show contact in court. This will help you with the custody fight should you want to go down that route.\n\nIt fuckin sucks man. I had a similar \"off\" vibe a while back with an ex. She was forever on her phone texting and told me it was her mum. Couldn't sleep one night & went through her phone, didn't find anything. Decided to uninstall WhatsApp & reinstall to restore a backup & found shit loads of messages to some guy she'd been \"getting to know\" that she'd deleted but her phone had backed up. Luckily we didn't have kids and everything was in my name (she moved in with me). Woke her up at 3am knowing she had work at 7am & tore her a new one, threw her out & never looked back.\n\nYou'll come out better off at the end even though it fuckin sucks right now.

Couple of things I wish I knew:\n\nFirst, it's good to have those screenshots - the people here have given good advice here about that, and not leaving the house, talking to a lawyer, etc.\n\nSecondly, there is no shame with walking away from your marriage - you are not the one breaking up your marriage, or family, or your vows, she already did that.  There is nothing wrong with trying to make it work either, but know that it is not an easier path to take, and that it can lead to a lot more pain than a clean break would.\n\nThirdly, your wife is likely about to say some very nasty things about you, or things that you did or didn't do which caused her to cheat.  Do not listen to that.  She did not do any of this because of you - she did it because she's selfish.  She did something terrible, and will say whatever she can to try to make herself feel less terrible. \n\nLastly, things are going to suck for a bit, but they will get better.  The pain that you feel now will be there for a long time, but it will lessen over time, and you'll learn to deal with it better.  No matter what you do over the next dew years, make sure that you have a support system of people (family, friends, a therapist) that you can talk to.  You may want to shut yourself off to other people, or you may think you can do this alone, or don't need help.  That's what I did, and I regret it.  \n\nBest of luck.  Take a bit of time to clear your head and think about what you want.  Send the kids to the grandparents for the night if you can.  And talk to her about this whenever you feel ready.",

You're gonna need to do one very important time and two optional but highly recommended things before confronting her:\n\n1. Find a well-reviewed divorce and family law attorney in your area. The very important part is shopping around. As ironic it may sound, don't take advice from Reddit strangers because an attorney may advise you to do something completely different. Proceed with confronting her when the attorney tells you to. \n\n2. Find yourself a good therapist. Start as early as you can. They will help you cope, keep your head on straight, show you the light at the end of the tunnel. \n\n3. Find your children a good pediatric therapist. As soon as your children find out, send them. I could have saved my kid years of mental health issues if I had done this sooner.\n\nAnd for god's sake don't drink shitty beer in such a vulnerable time. You just got your world rocked.

I knew she would be back late but stayed up anyway just in case she needed to be picked up or whatever. Well she rolled in about 1:30 drunk af. I promptly turn off the movie I\u2019m watching and we head to bed. I barely have time to get undressed before she says goodnight and rolls over. Now this struck me as odd because this woman gets RIDICULOUSLY horny when she been drinking. But I guess not tonight. Rather frustrated I climb into bed and try to write it off as her just being over tired and over served. Well I\u2019m just about asleep when her phone loudly goes off startling me back into consciousness. Seeing no reaction from her, and knowing her notification will go off at least one more time unless it is dealt with, I reach over and grab it to flip the silent mode button. And here\u2019s where shit gets fucked up. You see the notification was triggered by a text. A text from a guy who picked her up tonight, from some other random guys house bc random guy was super drunk and she was scared. His text, \u201cGoodnight darling.\u201d \n\nWhat followed was me doing what I\u2019ve never done, but obviously should have, a deep dive into her phone activity. What I found is as follows: she\u2019s fucked at least one of my, now former, friends. She is involved in an emotional affair with a friend of hers from college (also married) who seemed VERY eager to take advantage of his wife\u2019s absence so that he could spend time with mine (He was the noble knight who rescued her from rando drunk guy) And she has an impressively active tinder profile. Oh yeah and at one point this evening it seems she briefly considered hitching a ride with a stranger to Colorado. The texts, snaps and dms took about an hour to get through. \n\nSo now I\u2019m sitting here, house quiet, nauseous and internally raging, drinking cheap beer, trying to figure out how we got here. I\u2019d wake her up to confront her, but the kids are asleep and I just don\u2019t have the energy to fight tonight. There\u2019s 6 years down the fuckin drain bois.\n\nTL;DR - Found out my wife\u2019s been fucking other dudes when I tried to silence her notifications.\n\nUpdate: Just wanted to say thank you to everyone for the kind words of support and mostly sound advise. Y\u2019all are the best.",

The \"state\" is supposedly vested in the welfare of the child (which they should be), but their hamfisted \"help\" is sometimes like a bull in a China shop.\n\nI am old, and I have a great relationship with my kids, but they each in their own way are struggling with the fallout of their mom making very bad decisions and then treating them badly after the divorce.\n\nIt's a minefield that you will be forced to navigate, because if you don't put in some effort, things will be worse. \n\nGo to the ATM and take out the limit in daily cash ($300?). Immediately go to a post office box, or private mail-box and open an account. (I had box number 21 as an example) and I wrote the address of the private mail-box business with \"Apartment #21\"  (half of their customers do that). Check with them first, of course.\n\nGo to a completely different bank than your wife and start a checking account with $100, have the checks, ATM card and credit card sent to the new mailbox. Start a new Gmail account with a completely different password. \n\nShe has your mothers maiden name and social security number. Start a new account with lifelock, and lock your credit score at the three credit agencies.\n\nIf your paycheck is direct-deposit, change your deposit address at the first opportunity. You didn't mention if you own a house or rent. You didn't mention if she works. Until the divorce is settled in court, you have to show a good-faith effort to pay the mortgage/rent. It's not for her, it's for the kids and the court.\n\nFigure out which car she will want and which one you will want. Sometimes people lash out and do things they regret later, so get her name off the title of the car you need, so she can't get drunk one night and sell it.\n\nDepending on what you might respond with, I have more advice, but...the main theme is to prevent a bad situation from getting worse for both of you.",

Betrayal is some of the worst pain to go through. \n\nAlong with this, as everyone is immediately telling the OP to arm up, this is war, etc. etc. I wonder, what about the marriage? What was it like? Is there respect, care, love? Has something been happening recently to drive the two of you apart? How do you imagine she'd respond if/when you confront her about the affairs? Affairs are alarm bells that something in the marriage is not right, but affairs are typically only symptoms, not the cause. \n\nI'd say, yes, follow some of the advice people mentioned. Being prepared for the worst is smart, particularly when kids are involved. But also this can be a time to reflect on what you want: do you want to fix things, or are you out? Can you see yourself working through this pain together with your spouse? As the pain settles a bit, what would you want to do?\n\nI know in our culture is easy to cut people out when we get hurt and peace out. And that is a completely justified response if that's what you truly want. But there are also also other ways to handle it without going to war, just saying. Good luck to you either way.",

I knew she would be back late but stayed up anyway just in case she needed to be picked up or whatever. Well she rolled in about 1:30 drunk af. I promptly turn off the movie I\u2019m watching and we head to bed. I barely have time to get undressed before she says goodnight and rolls over. Now this struck me as odd because this woman gets RIDICULOUSLY horny when she been drinking. But I guess not tonight. Rather frustrated I climb into bed and try to write it off as her just being over tired and over served. Well I\u2019m just about asleep when her phone loudly goes off startling me back into consciousness. Seeing no reaction from her, and knowing her notification will go off at least one more time unless it is dealt with, I reach over and grab it to flip the silent mode button. And here\u2019s where shit gets fucked up. You see the notification was triggered by a text. A text from a guy who picked her up tonight, from some other random guys house bc random guy was super drunk and she was scared. His text, \u201cGoodnight darling.\u201d \n\nWhat followed was me doing what I\u2019ve never done, but obviously should have, a deep dive into her phone activity. What I found is as follows: she\u2019s fucked at least one of my, now former, friends. She is involved in an emotional affair with a friend of hers from college (also married) who seemed VERY eager to take advantage of his wife\u2019s absence so that he could spend time with mine (He was the noble knight who rescued her from rando drunk guy) And she has an impressively active tinder profile. Oh yeah and at one point this evening it seems she briefly considered hitching a ride with a stranger to Colorado. The texts, snaps and dms took about an hour to get through. \n\nSo now I\u2019m sitting here, house quiet, nauseous and internally raging, drinking cheap beer, trying to figure out how we got here. I\u2019d wake her up to confront her, but the kids are asleep and I just don\u2019t have the energy to fight tonight. There\u2019s 6 years down the fuckin drain bois.\n\nTL;DR - Found out my wife\u2019s been fucking other dudes when I tried to silence her notifications.\n\nUpdate: Just wanted to say thank you to everyone for the kind words of support and mostly sound advise. Y\u2019all are the best.",

      "text": "I'm going to echo a lot of different people here. In order of course.   \n    \n - Hold off on drinking any more for the immediate future if all possible. If you start increasing the amount you drink. You run the risk that she might see that as a way to try to divorce you herself under the claim that you're a drunkard.   \n    \n - Before doing anything, talk to a lawyer and with his/her guidance. Come up with a plan with their help of how you are going to address this. If you're going to go the route of divorce of course. Definitely check on the legality in your state about using the screenshots while you are there. Right now she doesn't know you know and you want to keep it that way as long as possible.   \n    \n - If you were going to be talking with friends about this in the meantime. Please make sure they are someone that you trust. If you have any concern. Just keep them in the dark until things are ready.   \n    \n - Do not do anything with joint accounts and joint property in the meantime. Again, she doesn't know you know. Only start doing things with them on the timeline/plan you and your lawyer have come up with. If you need to start opening up a separate accounts for yourself to prepare for things in the meantime. Find a way to do so with money outside of your normal finances if possible. Obviously just make sure the extra money is sourced from legal ways. Opening yourself up a PO box in the meantime might not be a bad idea either. That way you have somewhere you can have mail sent that you don't want her to see.   \n    \n - As for the people she is sleeping/having a relationship with. If they too are in a relationship. Hold off on letting their significant others know what is going on. Again your wife doesn't know that you know. So if you inform their significant others what's going on now. She's going to know that you're on to her. Wait to drop that bomb until at least papers are served. It may seem cruel not to let their significant others know right away. However you need to protect yourself at the moment. At the same time. When things are ready, you should definitely let them know.   \n    \n - Get tested for STDs. However try to do so in a way that doesn't end up with your wife knowing. Pay for the visit in cash if there's a copay if possible. Use my suggested PO box idea if you are concerned about the mail reaching the house.   \n    \n - As for the paternity test idea that was shared by someone else. I would only go that route if you have legitimate concern that they may not be yours. That is an entirely different can of worms. If you do choose to go that route. Consult a lawyer before even doing it.\n\nAt the end of the day, IANAL. Just someone offering suggestions a clear and level head.",

Do not speak ill of your soon to be ex wife to them. If you work hard to be amicable, your kids can be spared some of the uglier parts of divorce.\n\nStart working out whenever you have free time. Forget the beer. Instead drink a pre workout and hit the closest 24 hr gym. If you\u2019re angry, even better. Blast some music and hit it hard until you can\u2019t anymore.\n\nBoth of my parents were divorced several times before they had me. Life isn\u2019t over, just a relationship with a single person. If you put yourself out there when you\u2019re ready, you will find better. My dad had me at 50 years old. My older siblings are both nearing that age right now. I\u2019m in my mid-20s. \n\nDon\u2019t do anything stupid. Also, don\u2019t do anything your kids will look down on you for doing when they\u2019re your age.",

It's only a temporary solution that will make you feel worse afterwards, and could potentially be used against you when/if you go to court for custody of the kids.\n\nLast, try not to think of her having sex with other guys. It's easy to do, and it's natural, but that's just your brain torturing you (I always think of the scene in High Fidelity when the mail character first finds out that his gf has been cheating on him).",

      "text": "When filing for divorce, it's important to remember that the main goal of divorce proceedings in many states is strictly to settle the distribution of assets and custody. In these states, evidence of cheating makes no impact on the result.\n\n\nDivorce has nothing to do with justice. What often happens is the partner who got cheated on ends up having to write the cheater a big fat check for half the value of what they had together. A big dump of salt in a gaping wound. We often refer to it as \"the price of freedom\".\n\n\nPeople on Reddit like to pretend that evidence of cheating is some kind of magic bullet in divorce, but your lawyer will no better. By all means gather the evidence, but don't be surprised if the only satisfaction it brings is being able to throw it in her face. And if you get to do that, expect her to go for the throat and take you to the cleaners.\n\n\nSorry for what you're going through and what's to come, wish I could give you more comfort.",

Before I could gather myself, my ex wife spent all my money, refused to move out of the house, leaving me basically homeless. She totaled the car I had bought for her, leaving me with payments on a vehicle I no longer possess. Then a month before we got divorced, she got pregnant with dudes baby, which, in the state of Texas, means we cannot get divorced until paternity is determined. So I was stuck like this for over a year total. Because of the custody order, I had to sacrifice my good job for one that pays 1/4 of what I got before, due to being unable to travel any longer and having to take kids to school and do homework with them in the afternoon, etc. Im struggling like a MF and she's getting all these grants to get free food and free college, plus child support, she doesn't work at all. It's just insane. But one thing I can say through all of this, I'm happier than I've ever been. Youl get through this bud. Check out r/survivinginfidelity",

I knew she would be back late but stayed up anyway just in case she needed to be picked up or whatever. Well she rolled in about 1:30 drunk af. I promptly turn off the movie I\u2019m watching and we head to bed. I barely have time to get undressed before she says goodnight and rolls over. Now this struck me as odd because this woman gets RIDICULOUSLY horny when she been drinking. But I guess not tonight. Rather frustrated I climb into bed and try to write it off as her just being over tired and over served. Well I\u2019m just about asleep when her phone loudly goes off startling me back into consciousness. Seeing no reaction from her, and knowing her notification will go off at least one more time unless it is dealt with, I reach over and grab it to flip the silent mode button. And here\u2019s where shit gets fucked up. You see the notification was triggered by a text. A text from a guy who picked her up tonight, from some other random guys house bc random guy was super drunk and she was scared. His text, \u201cGoodnight darling.\u201d \n\nWhat followed was me doing what I\u2019ve never done, but obviously should have, a deep dive into her phone activity. What I found is as follows: she\u2019s fucked at least one of my, now former, friends. She is involved in an emotional affair with a friend of hers from college (also married) who seemed VERY eager to take advantage of his wife\u2019s absence so that he could spend time with mine (He was the noble knight who rescued her from rando drunk guy) And she has an impressively active tinder profile. Oh yeah and at one point this evening it seems she briefly considered hitching a ride with a stranger to Colorado. The texts, snaps and dms took about an hour to get through. \n\nSo now I\u2019m sitting here, house quiet, nauseous and internally raging, drinking cheap beer, trying to figure out how we got here. I\u2019d wake her up to confront her, but the kids are asleep and I just don\u2019t have the energy to fight tonight. There\u2019s 6 years down the fuckin drain bois.\n\nTL;DR - Found out my wife\u2019s been fucking other dudes when I tried to silence her notifications.\n\nUpdate: Just wanted to say thank you to everyone for the kind words of support and mostly sound advise.

          "text": "It\u2019s reposted over at r/wellthatsucks\n\nTIFU by silencing my wife\u2019s phone.\n\n\nMy wife went out with work friends tonight. I knew she would be back late but stayed up anyway just in case she needed to be picked up or whatever. Well she rolled in about 1:30 drunk af. I promptly turn off the movie I\u2019m watching and we head to bed. I barely have time to get undressed before she says goodnight and rolls over. Now this struck me as odd because this woman gets RIDICULOUSLY horny when she been drinking. But I guess not tonight. Rather frustrated I climb into bed and try to write it off as her just being over tired and over served. Well I\u2019m just about asleep when her phone loudly goes off startling me back into consciousness. Seeing no reaction from her, and knowing her notification will go off at least one more time unless it is dealt with, I reach over and grab it to flip the silent mode button. And here\u2019s where shit gets fucked up. You see the notification was triggered by a text. A text from a guy who picked her up tonight, from some other random guys house bc random guy was super drunk and she was scared. His text, \u201cGoodnight darling.\u201d \n\nWhat followed was me doing what I\u2019ve never done, but obviously should have, a deep dive into her phone activity. What I found is as follows: she\u2019s fucked at least one of my, now former, friends. She is involved in an emotional affair with a friend of hers from college (also married) who seemed VERY eager to take advantage of his wife\u2019s absence so that he could spend time with mine (He was the noble knight who rescued her from rando drunk guy) And she has an impressively active tinder profile. Oh yeah and at one point this evening it seems she briefly considered hitching a ride with a stranger to Colorado. The texts, snaps and dms took about an hour to get through. \n\nSo now I\u2019m sitting here, house quiet, nauseous and internally raging, drinking cheap beer, trying to figure out how we got here. I\u2019d wake her up to confront her, but the kids are asleep and I just don\u2019t have the energy to fight tonight. There\u2019s 6 years down the fuckin drain bois.\n\nTL;DR - Found out my wife\u2019s been fucking other dudes when I tried to silence her notifications.\n\nUpdate: Just wanted to say thank you to everyone for the kind words of support and mostly sound advise. Y\u2019all are the best.",

We've been at it for 6 years like this and everything seems pretty damn good in his little world. \n\nBe the better person when shit gets hard. Never talk shit to your kids about mom.

Sadly, many people never see the 'oncoming train' until it's right on top of them.\n\nAs the others have said, don't leave your family, stay the source of responsibility, as it should be relatively easy to paint your wife's behavior for what it is: a serial adulterer.\n\nAdditionally, if you're up for it, you may also wish to consider suing your friend for their impact/dissolution of your marriage.  I don't know what state you're in, however many states would consider such an affair by a known party to constitute 'marital interference'  - making them civilly liable.\n\nAs for your wife - your call (given your kids state), however given your wife's level of involvement, I would really be ready to torch the entire marriage, and go all in on a divorce, and sue for custody.\n\nThere is a woman out  there for you - one you can honor, trust and have as a life-long partner.  No one deserves this kind of disrespect, especially someone who has children (as they are the real victims here).\n\nGood luck... =(",

Find a marriage counselor. Have at least as many sessions as years you were married. Figure out if your family is worth saving and if your wife can do the heavy lifting of doing it. \n\nI stayed married after an affair, but my husband was contrite, it was a single/short event, and he was remorseful and worked very hard to fix things and help me heal. It took me 5 years to feel normal again. Some cheaters can do that, and some can\u2019t. The counseling will help you figure out if that is possible for you. Remember, the kids are #1, otherwise I\u2019d say head for the hills. It is a shit sandwich no matter what way you cut it, but my son is graduating from high school this year, and we have an intact, happyish family. So, it can be done, and I am immensely grateful, but a lot depends on her character and doing the work. If you are religious at all, you may want to look into Retrovaille. (We aren\u2019t, but it still helped us).\n\nI also suggest survivinginfidelity.com and not the sub here.\n\nThe affair was about her and her issues and not you or your marriage \u2014 be clear on that. It is like someone choosing to snort coke\u2026 not your fault.\n\nAlso, final bit of advice \u2014 don\u2019t out her to everyone. At least not until you decide. Again, this is your kids\u2019 mom\u2026 and, if you do decide to reconcile people can be judgy. Plus, it affects kids to hear their parent is a cheater, especially when young.",

Just screenshot and upload to a cloud or similar storage that only you have access to.

Once you have all evidence in a safe location, contact a family attorney who is experienced with cases of infidelity where children are involved. Do not tell her you know anything unless the lawyer confirms you have a case and can start legal proceedings (I am of course assuming divorce is the endgame here, because you'd be batshit insane to stay with someone like this, kids or no kids).

If someone is likely to confront her on your behalf don\u2019t tell them. Honestly, she deserves whatever is coming her way, I know the kids make things so much more complicated, you have to be strong for them now. Just don\u2019t do anything stupid. And STOP DRINKING.

This will probably be buried, and I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll read it, but here goes. \n\nFirst off: get a therapist. Talk to them. Be honest. Cry. Every single emotion you\u2019re feeling is normal and allowed. \n\nSecond off: if you seek reconciliation, set a line with her. What will it take for you to be truly done? If that line is crossed, even once, even a little, then you\u2019re done. Don\u2019t move it back for anything. My wife cheated. We discussed and agreed on rules. She broke those rules the day after I found out. I said it was fine. Repeat for an additional three months (of her continuing to cheat on me) until finally I held strong to my convictions and we got divorced. \n\nThird: this is the one no one told me about. You will still find yourself missing her from time to time. You\u2019ll think about the good times and have some longing for her. That\u2019s allowed. You can have those happy memories. Don\u2019t think you\u2019re broken or weak for missing her. It\u2019s okay. \n\nFourth: find a new hobby. Something you\u2019ve always wanted to do but always pushed to the side because you wanted more time with your wife. Mine was archery. It was never a priority, but I has always wanted to try it. I poured myself into it to try and cope. I learned that it\u2019s probably one of my favorite activities. Hopefully you can find something like that for yourself. \n\nI\u2019m two years post finding out about her affair as of yesterday. I\u2019m doing well now. Some days it still hurts when I hear some random songs or think of random things we did together. Most days for you will be absolutely shitty for a while. Then it goes to some days will be shitty. Then, slowly, you\u2019ll become a whole person again. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this, and if you need some support, feel free to DM me.",

You found out about this shit before hearing it from someone else which likely would have also resulted in her knowing you found out before you could take action, and you found out before your kids did so now you get to control how they find out.\n\nSpeaking of kids, focus on what's best for THEM. In a divorce it's always the kids who get screwed the worst, whether they think it's somehow their fault or whether they have to pick (or don't get to pick if the court decides for them) which parent they stay with and which one gets visitation. Don't get into revenge or trash talking, it will only make you look bad and will be worse for your kids. If she does it then it makes her look bad and puts you in a better position.\n\nLike so many others have said, the best thing you can do is document the evidence, contact a lawyer, and don't let on that you know until she has been served. Don't talk to family including your kids, don't talk to friends, don't talk to ANYONE aside from a lawyer because that risks her finding out from someone else and you don't want that. Act normal around her, or if you can't bring yourself to do it then tell her you're sick. Get yourself a family therapist so you can bring your kids too as soon as it's over.\n\n.....And if you're in a no-fault divorce state, pray you get a sympathetic judge who doesn't just divide everything down the middle.",

She's engaging in outrageously risky behavior and could bring an STD straight tf back to you, your kids, or anybody who uses your bathroom. I know that sounds like I'm being dramatic, but I have friends with HPV for that exact reason - their SO brought that shit back to them after doing what your wife is doing. She's not respecting you or your family in general, and frankly, you deserve better. \n\nBy the way, a good way to get all the evidence on her phone at once is to use the screen record option and scroll through the evidence while it's recording everything on the screen as a video. You don't have to take constant screen caps, it's quicker, and you only need to air drop the video to your phone when you're through. \n\nI hate cliches, but the bright spot here is your kids. Sometimes a person doesn't come in your life to stay, but to bring other, and better, people to you. \n\nIf it's any consolation, once she gets with her college buddy and that marriage ends, she'll do the same to him. He picked up another man's wife he is actively trying to have a sexual relationship with from some rando's house to play. He 100% knows the type of person she is and deserves any misery she brings him. I'm sorry you're going through this. If you have family that can take the kids for a few days, ask them. This won't be pretty when it hits the fan, but it will be worth it in the end. You sound like a good guy, I wish the best for you, dude.",

She's not sorry she did the things, she's only sorry she got caught.\n2. Cheating usually isn't spur of the moment, it usually stems from many weeks or months of entertaining flirtation and attention from guys and it was wrong from the start.\n3. If the person could do this to you once they're always going to be able to do it to you again.\n4. If you do decide to give her a second chance make her fully own and confess to everything. If she is reluctant about anything she's not willing to quit doing those things yet.\n5. Put her ass on probation for a long time. She doesn't go out without you, you're free to check her phone whenever you want, she has to show that she wants the relationship as much as you do. There's no third chances there's no slipping, there's no 'oh I forgot...'. people can be reformed but a cheetah rarely changes its spots.\n6. Don't spend more time on a mistake just because you already have a lot of time invested in it. Let that shit go and go find people to be around that genuinely want the best for you.\n7.

I knew she would be back late but stayed up anyway just in case she needed to be picked up or whatever. Well she rolled in about 1:30 drunk af. I promptly turn off the movie I\u2019m watching and we head to bed. I barely have time to get undressed before she says goodnight and rolls over. Now this struck me as odd because this woman gets RIDICULOUSLY horny when she been drinking. But I guess not tonight. Rather frustrated I climb into bed and try to write it off as her just being over tired and over served. Well I\u2019m just about asleep when her phone loudly goes off startling me back into consciousness. Seeing no reaction from her, and knowing her notification will go off at least one more time unless it is dealt with, I reach over and grab it to flip the silent mode button. And here\u2019s where shit gets fucked up. You see the notification was triggered by a text. A text from a guy who picked her up tonight, from some other random guys house bc random guy was super drunk and she was scared. His text, \u201cGoodnight darling.\u201d \n\nWhat followed was me doing what I\u2019ve never done, but obviously should have, a deep dive into her phone activity. What I found is as follows: she\u2019s fucked at least one of my, now former, friends. She is involved in an emotional affair with a friend of hers from college (also married) who seemed VERY eager to take advantage of his wife\u2019s absence so that he could spend time with mine (He was the noble knight who rescued her from rando drunk guy) And she has an impressively active tinder profile. Oh yeah and at one point this evening it seems she briefly considered hitching a ride with a stranger to Colorado. The texts, snaps and dms took about an hour to get through. \n\nSo now I\u2019m sitting here, house quiet, nauseous and internally raging, drinking cheap beer, trying to figure out how we got here. I\u2019d wake her up to confront her, but the kids are asleep and I just don\u2019t have the energy to fight tonight. There\u2019s 6 years down the fuckin drain bois.\n\nTL;DR - Found out my wife\u2019s been fucking other dudes when I tried to silence her notifications.\n\nUpdate: Just wanted to say thank you to everyone for the kind words of support and mostly sound advise. Y\u2019all are the best.",

I know how hard it might be to get through the next few months, especially with kids, when things feel the way they do now. Counseling can help work through all the heavy stuff that makes it hard to breathe, whether you choose to try to work it out or call it quits. An attorney is a valuable asset if you choose to divorce. Try your best to remain civil. You aren\u2019t alone, and I hate that someone else is experiencing this. I know how embarrassing it is. I know that stupid feeling like you need to protect your unfaithful spouse. It\u2019s not your fault. She chose to do things she knew would hurt you. She made those choices, repeatedly. She didn\u2019t accidentally sign up for tinder. She is responsible for her actions, NOT YOU. She knows the difference between right and wrong. I know how hard it is to accept that. It\u2019s easy to blame yourself for whatever shortcomings/mistakes you have made and keep replaying it over and over in your head, wondering if you had done something different if you could have avoided it. It is NOT your fault. You cannot make someone choose to do the right thing. Sending positive support your way. You will get through this. Hang in there, and don\u2019t forget to brush your teeth. Small accomplishments are still accomplishments. I hope your pain subsides sooner than later. Take care",

She is the person who cheated on you, there is no reason to skew reality.   \n\n\nSimilar story happened to me.

Screenshots, conversations, receipts, take everything. Erase your tracks so that she doesn\u2019t know the jigs up. \n\nMeet with every high powered divorce attorney in your region. This will serve you two fold; it will help you find the nastiest pitbull willing to go to the mat for you and it will prejudice any attorney she could possibly meet with. This will leave her with a 70yr old retired real estate salesman who\u2019s doing this as a hobby. They will outline the legal in your region steps to take while you have the initiative. They have seen it all before and will happily be the Virgil to your Dante as you navigate this  personal hell. \n\nYou will have an emotional task in front of you; devoid of yourself of any emotions for this person as you setup a scorched earth campaign of biblical proportions and perform an Oscar worthy performance of a normal husband in the meantime. \n\nMany people get to the moment of truth and have second thoughts, that maybe they can work it out. They think they can salvage some degree of the love they felt before. It\u2019s only natural, humans are gamblers willing to take long shots. \n\nThe person you loved is gone. \n\nWhether they ever existed is beside the point. They aren\u2019t that person anymore. This isn\u2019t a substance abuse issue or drifting apart. This person lied to your face and dishonored you with wild abandon. They relied on you fulfilling your oath to them, while abandoning it themselves. You are free of whatever promise you swore to them. \n\nThis person is now nothing more than a business partner who\u2019s trying to get one over on you. This is a person you will after a point not have another conversation with that isn\u2019t by text/email or witnessed by an impartial witness. If it wasn\u2019t for the children you would never have to see them again. \n\nWhile this emotional disengagement is going on you have to perform the almost schizophrenic task of acting like nothing has changed. Don\u2019t become more loving or let your resentment shine through, any deviation from the norm will raise her suspicions. This jeopardizes every other machination you have set in motion. Time is on your side if you\u2019re a good actor, she has a sweet gig where all her needs are met and she gets to do what she wants. \n\nRemember that you must have patience in this endeavor. Michael Corleone slowly maneuvered his enemies until his victory was assured, Sonny Corleone was struck down in the street. One allowed his emotions to control him and the other controlled them in turn. \n\nI\u2019m sorry this happened to you and the emotional turmoil you will endure, but the steps to strengthen your position you take today will save you pain in the future tenfold. Do not act in anger but in purpose. \n\nGood luck and god speed\u2026",

She should have had the common decency to tell him she wants to go fool around with other people and that he wasn't enough long before it turned into cheating. A real woman would have pulled up her big girl britches a long time ago and been honest rather then acting the fool and screwing around. There are zero situations where cheating is okay and every situation (minus abusive ones) where honesty is better.\n\nEdit: If anyone reads this thread the conversation has been deleted by user Nayajenny, whom was not fond of being called out. Their initial argument was that any \"real man\" would have satisfied the wife to the point she didn't want to cheat and that she had hardly any blame in this. They then stated that women have biological drives that lead them to cheating which lends them an excuse to cheat while men do not have said genetic markers which means they have zero excuses to ever cheat. They refused to link me to any studies that may have proven or disproven their point but instead linked me to dig for a year old post in r/FemaleDatingStrategy. When I first started arguing I was referred to as an \"incel-man child\" initially simply for defending that cheating is not a binary gender thing and that he didn't _make her cheat_. When I pointed out that they were arguing with a woman, they stated I must be a self loathing person who is \"part of the reason women are still opressed\". Yikes.",

                              "text": "Gender aside, why is it acceptable for any human to cheat on another? If you're in a committed relationship and you feel unsatisfied with it, isn't it your job to speak up or leave (again, assuming no abuse is involved- that can get really hairy)? I mean why be married at all if you're the kind of person who enjoys poly? Or is just someone who likes sex with multiple partners? You can have your cake and eat it too, but you have to be honest about what you want and nearly all cheating issues come down to a total lapse in communication. \n\nSo, you are right that there is definitely a side we haven't heard. There was probably events leading up to her decision to cheat. Her decision to cheat was the nail in the coffin when she didn't have to lay one down in the first place. Leave before you cheat. Marriage isn't a 90's American-high school-teen made-for-television-drama; it's a very tangible construct that once broken down to its parts, is very messy. Lawyers, court, mediators, therapy, housing, finances, children, custody, child support, visitation rights, assets, insurance, schooling...everything that makes their world go round now up in the air because someone acted childish rather then speaking out for help, working it through with their spouse, or just flat out filing for divorce. \n\nNow that he can file with evidence of her cheating, she has no credibility and will most likely be the pariah of the court. Even if she is being abused it will be hard to prove unless she has photographed and dated evidence because it will be seen as a retaliatory argument rather than her actual logic for cheating. Also, when you're being abused, your first thought usually isn't to cheat- it's to escape so there's a thought (speaking as someone who has been beaten in a relationship).",

      "text": "\nScenario 1 (Catch her in the act the legal way), and I mean truly catching her literally having sex and it will be hard for you to  see this but it can work.\n\nYou can be on the winning side without losing almost anything but that \"*****\" of  yours. Sorry OP I didn't mean to call her that, but I just hope that your feelings for her don't cloud your mind. Here is a plan. The \"Catch Her in the Act Plan\" which can be done  with the right moves. Furthermore, You can get everything and anything and since you didn't say anything about a prenup, I am sure you can hopefully do this or pull off one of my other scenarios.\n\n1) Use Google maps and track her history and where she is going. You will need to be a bit secretive about this one because this can be a true \"catch her in the act situation\" if you can pull this off. Get one truly trustful and close friend that really doesn't know her too well if you can. This is one of your witnesses so you really need to know them like a brother or sister or something.  Most of us have at least one . \n\n Now Google will sometimes send her emails to let her know someone else is accessing your phone so it's time for new phones  with a different company.  Icloud is not your friend in this situation but Google can be.  I would also say honey \"lets get some new phones\". Make a excuse. The new phones need to be Verizon or ATT; I recommend Verizon if you don't have it yet and ATT as second option. Place the Verizon account in your name and get two lines. Give her her new phone but both of these lines remains l truly in your name . You do not give her account access and limit her to seeing her data usage and minutes and say oh honey or babe this is a Verizon thing but everything is still the same. Now you track her habits through Google maps and get the information you need from this so you know everywhere she goes especially when it's her nights out etc. Also, being drunk in front of kids can be seen as of act of neglect if it comes at right time at moment. If y'all ever get into an argument, do it away from kids from now on.\n\nAdd on: Like the people said above. Make sure all of your \"priorities' are in order to protect yourself and your kids. I grew up as a kid that saw my parents divorce and throughout my life, I dealt with some mental things that started from that. Try your best to leave the kids out of this and once the divorce etc is finalized, that recommendation of child therapy is a definite \"Must\" since kids and even teenagers can do some unexpected things and start to become more secretive and isolated from you and grow up to have mental health problems. Therapy is also recommended for you as well of course. Dude you are sort of traumatized so you need to act on your therapy first and foremost \n\n2). The other thing you need to know. Sadly especially if you have female kids, they will side with their mother most likely. Your sons if you have any would maybe side with you. This is why you get them involved last (when court dates are about to happen and do this a few weeks before those dates to prepare their minds) \n\n\n3). I say act normal for at least 2 to 3 months to get this squared away the right way. You seem like a good guy and you was honest and brave to tell all of us your story and I don't mind helping you draft a plan that can save yourself some additional heartbreak but take your current heartbreak and throw it out the window and be strong. You are a father and you are a good man. Tell yourself this to get you through this and if you do have that friend who doesn't give a rats @$$  about her then utilize them too to help you get through this and allow them to become a witness if and when necessary.\n\nEnsure the Verizon or ATT new  lines are purely in your name and ensure you don't add her anywhere in that account and just place the line you give her as wireless caller #2. She won't think nothing of it  if already on Verizon, use ATT instead and transfer your same numbers so she won't be suspicious. Also ensure you are using Google Maps and not apple maps if you have a iPhone. You still need to be able to track her where abouts and essentially make a plan with a good friend to catch her in the act. \n\nAdd on: you can get one of those apple smart tags or Samsung tags to track her if she keeps her Google map where abouts private\". You should act like it was just a way to protect your wife and you wanted to know where she has been to ensure her safety but don't let her know at all.\n\n\nShe literally is a true \"you know what\" and if you can catch her in the act with a witness. You become even more  iron clad. I hope you also looked at the locations she has been in past several months because Google does record this stuff. Go through her location history and map everything out by time and date and when she usually heads out if you can.  You want to eventually go somewhere where she normally goes and then figure her out a little more . Sorry to say, but people like her can have sex in some weird places so catching her in the act may not be too hard.   \n\nAdd on: Not trying to be mean about your wife, but basically she has done too much to save any part of this relationship you have with her (excluding the kids). The kids are always the true worry and holding on to your finances, job, and your life .  Do not give up on yourself and please stop drinking and figure out a way to be even better. \n\n\n4) If you start therapy yourself now, you have a advantage . \"This maybe may be the most important advice I'm giving you.\" You remember, your therapist cannot give out any information without your approval but this therapist can eventually become a key asset for your court case when  you do give her approval . You will not tell your therapist you saw screenshots or any messages. You sort of have to swing it like this  with the therapist.\n\nA.  First, tell your therapist you are going through some highly emotional situations that involves your wife. Most importantly, TELL the therapy about all the good things you do for your kids and tell her about each of your children like a true father and that you only want to LOVE and continue to protect their overall well-being.  Remember this needs you to be good at faking some things and you must present yourself as that  All-American father and get some feelings out. Tell the therapist you only suspect her cheating initially and only say it because she comes home drunk, parties  etc. \n\nB. Start weekly sessions so that the therapist can keep a record of everything. Tell your therapist how much you love your kids etc  so this is all in his/hers notes or audio recording. Please sound very sincere  once you do catch her in the act. \n\nC. Once and if you do catch her in the act let the therapist know what happened and act like  It was by chance along and you needed to go out to just  to reduce stress and be with your real friends.\n\nD. Track her either by Google maps, air tags or Samsung tags similar to this or any of the other one if you can't track her. The tags must only be placed like under the seat or somewhere in her car where she can't be find it.  If she says  she wants her friends to pick her up when she goes out. Just say honey drive your car and if anything happens, just park it and let a friend drive you homw. Remember you can only legally put one of those tags on her car for court purposes so start letting her use her or your car more often when she goes out and say what I told you to do.\n\n5). If you need a different scenario because you already did some things out of order to make better progress. Please just let me know. Others here can offer input but this has worked for a friend of mine and he is in a good place and did not have to go through even higher loads of stress in his future . Carrying the stress is the worst thing so you want this out the way as soon as possible  but some things take time and cannot be done in one day or even one month especially cases like yours.\n\nFor any one who has read scenario 1, thank you. Scenario 2 if the OP needs it will come next if he asks. This may involve dashboard cams or using a home front and back entrance cameras because there is that slight change she may be doing this in your home while kids and you are away as well. From what you stated, I'm sure this may happen sometimes especially if she uses Tinder. I also have a 3rd, 4th and 5th scenario if you have already started up the fire that burning and trying to reduce that flame because you are still heartbroken or angry. \n\nAlways remember the kids come first so please don't involve them or tell them anything until its time and until you have schedules them to see a family therapist with you and them alone after all has been said and done.\n\nAnd get that therapist, it can be your true defense. Come off honest, sincere and as a caring and loving father and husband and present this like something you could never thought would happen. \n\nAlso, if you are not doing so yet. Just start doing more things with your kids to bring the tension down. Try to not involve the wife. This would be a stress reliever and if they have brought joy to your life, they can only bring more and help your mind stay clear.\n\nSorry for no summary because it's a lot here guys and any typos.\n\nBelieve in yourself and do what is necessary and don't doubt yourself.",

      "text": "You have a tough ride ahead of you. It will be painful and tough but even though you don't see it now at the end of it there is a sun and happy fullfiling life where you thank God that you are not with this woman anymore. All of the advices here are pretty good but I will add another important one:  \nI have been cheated on(much different story but nevertheless affected me a lot) and I did a terrible mistake afterwards so let me describe it for you to not do the same:  \nGet ASAP to least emotional and most rational state you can. If needed ask for help an intelligent and understanding friend or a therapist. While in that rational state make a decision if do you want to end this marriage or not. If you decide that it's over then just end it. You will have plenty of things you want to tell her, question to ask etc. but do none of it. It's your mind tricking you because you are in the state that you love and hate at the same time and your \"loving part\" just want to interact with the girl. You will always rationalize that \"it's our last meeting to ask last questions and say farewell and then I am gone\" but as soonest it happens you will feel need for another meeting. Eventually you will start saying yourself \"ok at the end of this month I am breaking up for good\" and stuff like that but it never ends.  \n\n\nI wasted literally 2 years of my life in such purgatory that we kinda a broke up but were still behaving like a couple(toxic couple). This was terrible 2 years long relationship with my constant stress and nested hate toward her for what she did.  After a real break up I had a tough time that lasted some time but it could have happened much earlier. I kinda wasted the best time of my life(university time) for this one toxic relationship.   \n\n\nI will also mention that today I don't remember any of these \"important\" talks and questions I had to have with her before breaking up and I don't really care. It was waste of the time and my mind tricking me into spending time with the person. If that is necessary write a letter(without possibility to response) or something but whatever happens cut this relationship fully as soonest as possible. It will be painful but believe me or not; single life is like 10 times better than poor relationship. It is actually fun and it's hard for me to give up on it now even though I've met person that I could call as \"wife\" in the soon future. The only thing better than single life is relationship with person that actually respects you but for you to have a chance to meet such a woman you need to cut the poison out of your life first.  \n\n\nThat was my main advice. Let me add some minor too:  \n\\-After break up give yourself some time to mourn. Allow yourself to cry, think, watch your old photos or whatever you need(be careful with alcohol etc. meanwhile) but it must be a short time. 3 months is max you can give yourself. After that start a new single active(!) life.  \n\\-engage in some hobby that forces you to interact in people(in real). Preferably sport. Martial sports are amazing environment for man and you can try it.   \n\\-If the one above is not a sport then do some sport on top of it. You wont believe how refreshing for you will it be to see yourself active and in form when compared with your old you.  \n\\-Don't instantly get into new relationship. This will be extreme toxic. Get into relationship only after you feel happy with how your life is going.",

Consult with a lawyer. Document as much as you can. If you can,build yourself up some cash reserve. Lots of good advice here.  Let her know when your ready. You have the power now.

No. Women who get drunk in groups encourage each other to do all types of disgusting immoral behavior. The same can be true for men but I honestly see it less when it comes to cheating. Maybe because women can more easily attain multiple partners, I don\u2019t know.\n\nEither way you should have put your foot down years ago and stopped this foolishness. This is your wife, your woman. You should not have allowed her to begin this pattern of behavior.\n\nI\u2019m really sorry you have to deal with this man, but hopefully it keeps you aware of what modern women are really like once they are given social permission to let their inhibitions go and you can protect yourself next time you start to see a woman going down this path.\n\nYou seem like a pretty understanding guy from this post, the post doesn\u2019t even seem ANGRY, just SAD, and I\u2019m sorry someone you trusted hurt you that way. \n\nBest of luck going forward",

Long story short, she talked me into taking her back after the first time, then the second, third... The pattern continued until it ruined my self confidence enough to really trap me. There was another catalyst that finally made me file for divorce, but don't be me. There's heat of the moment mistakes, then there's active disregard for you as a person and partner with all the premeditated serial cheating.

      "text": "Been there. 7 years in a dystopian nightmare, thinking it was real and.beautiful - 'doing what I\u2019ve never done, but obviously should have' was exactly how I discovered the serial cheating too, messages, people who you thought were your friends. It's one of the worst experiences in the world. There will be alot of pain, a lot of just existing and not living. Do what you gotta do and forgive yourself for it, even when that feels impossible. It is a long journey, potentially a lifetime of hurt will now burden you. Mistakes will be made from the feelings, and that's ok. This is a psychological gauntlet that non victims of cheating will ever understand. This is not a breakup, the glutinous cheater is no longer an issues, they've become trash, trash that you'll have complicated feelings for since you're love was at least genuine till the end. The end of this relationship is more one sided on your end in the form of betrayal and trauma, a  million daggers that weigh on you. It feels very heavy in the beginning. Each day will vary in the amount you decide to pull out from your back, and from your heart. If you can't pull any out, just living to see another day is a victory. It will be a long time before you will come a day where you can function again. We unfortunate souls fell in love with monsters, and they'll always have something of our hearts we cannot take back from them. All the while, they will move on with life like it's nothing, for they had every opportunity to say no to the temptations that lead them astray from a stable loving partner. They already separated themselves from you when they chose to betray you. It will always be your battle, while they have already moved past it for sometime.",

My wife spent 10 years telling me she loved me, she was so happy to be with me, and she was content with our life and didn't ever want it to change.\n\nThen one day, with no prior warning, she tells me she doesn't love me any more, she's not sure she ever loved me, and she's been unhappy for years and wants a separation. Next thing I know, I move back to my home town to restart my life and 5 months go by with barely a word from her, I tell her we need to talk about this situation, and we do. I find out she basically decided I was a huge loser because I lost my job to COVID and decided it was time to use that as an opportunity to switch careers because I hated my career. I was apparently a drug-addicted alcoholic in her eyes who would never be good enough for her.\n\nThis from the woman who never once had a complaint about anything for 10 solid years.\n\nShe also spent months prior to asking for the separation having an emotional affair with a guy online, spending every evening sometimes well into the morning hours chatting with him on Discord.\n\nWhen I told her I was uncomfortable with that, she gas-lighted me by letting me think I was just reliving past trauma (my previous girlfriend cheated on me after having an emotional affair with my best friend and they grew close because we all played World of Warcraft together and she would stay up all night talking to him while I was asleep).\n\nNow, as you can imagine, I have massive trust issues and I don't know if those will ever go away.\n\nSorry for what happened to you man.

I let her leave with him and got the next flight out of the country. 3 years later it still hurts me to know I did everything I could and lost it all anyway. These bitches aren't worth shit. I'm sorry you had to go through that man. You're not alone, and I promise you can rebuild better than before.",

      "text": "Man... That is shit hits really hard.\n\nBeen there, you should check the dedicated subreddits - If I'm not wrong it's r/survivinginfidelity\n\nMy advice:\nDrop the booze for now and stay sharp. You will need it - try to stick to the booze for when you are having a good time.\n\nGet tested and DNA test the kids. That's not an option - you just discovered your life is full of lies and you do not know your partner. It's a hard fact to admit when for 6 years you were fed a narrative while other dudes actually knew her for who she really is. \n\nDon't fall for the sunken cost fallacy. It's not 6 years down the drain. You are now at a crossroad that either lead to the worst of the best time... But you are the one who needs to make the path you want.\n\nDo not simp. Do not try to find excuses for her or for the relationship. \nThe \"for the kids\" is a lie - the kids will notice and know when there is conflict, it's better to walk away for two reason: a stable and sane environment - they also need to learn what a real relationship can not be replaced by poor acting. Bipolar isn't an excuse, drunk isn't an excuse. \n\nHopefully you made copies and got the evidence needed, but once it is done, do not go pain shopping.\n\nThe most important aspect when facing this situation is to not lose yourself - you are about to lose all your innocence and genuine feelings of appreciation - this is why you need to stay sharp. This is why you need to not go look for more proof or ask for more.\n\nShe cheated - it does not matter why because regardless of the reason there is only 2 outcomes; she takes the blame or she doesn't. If she doesn't take the blame, she's gonna blame shift and make you carry her own sins - as an example if you work 12h a day and break your back for her, it will sound like \"you were absent and I felt alone\" - even if the reality is that you sacrificed yourself whilr you had zero support from your wife... But it's just an example.\nIf she takes the blame, from what you wrote, she's a serial cheater and trust can never be really recovered because from now on you know she's capable of this.\n\nI'm gonna be blunt. If you wish for reconciliation or make it work, you will have to sacrifice your happiness, self-esteem and probably become a depressed paranoid man for the years to come. Leaving would hurt a lot but it would allow you to find yourself faster.\n\nRegardless of your choice: you need to make use of the AP.\nIf you wish for reconciliation, she needs real consequences. Don't fall for the tears - she's not a victim even if you leave her. Make her destroy the AP's life if she wants a chance to reconcile.\n\nYou will read a lot of people talking about No contact with ap - this doesn't work. You can't enforce a no contact, if she wish to go underground she will. What you need to do is pin them against each others so the NC idea comes from them. If the Ap has a wife, make your wife come clean to his, if there's a non fraternisation policy at work and it's a coworker, make her go to hr to report the dude for sexual harassment. Make them go at war and destroy each others - it doesn't matter if she lose her job or get beat up by AP's wife - the goal is for them to be at war.\n\nIf you wish to leave - use the info of her cheating to your advantage in the divorce. Threaten to make it public, threaten to destroy her reputation and her lover's if she doesn't comply to your demands.\n\nThere's so much to say...\n\nAnyway, I hope you manage to get out of this situation a better man.\n\nCheers bro. My thoughts are with you.",

He is a co-worker who broke up his family(wife who got breast cancer during this dust up and left his two young daughters) to be with my ex. This started for me May of '19, we were officially divorced Sept.of 20 and I only found out about the dude Feb of '21. All three of the others knew and the other ex wife never told me what she knew and she knew it all. You bypassed all that. Thank whoever you thank when you dodge a huge bullet. She was just a minute away from realizing she could make it your fault when it isn't. It's all her.",

It's not too late to have an open marriage. You might be able to  have  some kind of arrangement without throwing everything away. We can't pick and choose the qualities of our mates. She must have qualities that are important to you. She wanted to have a family with you. Fidelity is obviously not her strong card. Lots of subtleties will guide your decision. If she is just a shitty person then definitely sever your relationship. First, talk with her. Don't go collecting weaponry that you can attack her with. You don't have to blame yourself for anything but, you guys decided years ago that you both are in this together. Good luck.",

I'll make sure to try to keep this on the down-low for a while so she doesn't know you are on to her.

Won\u2019t she be suspicious if you suddenly stop wanting to sleep with her?  I don\u2019t have the best advice here, but you don\u2019t want her snooping through your things thinking you\u2019re cheating if you all are normally intimate on a regular basis and it suddenly stops. I can just see her finding the saved text messages in your phone or noticing that you\u2019re suddenly interested in working out and wondering if you are getting fit for someone else. Unfortunately I think business as usual means you should act as closely to normal as possible. \n\nIf you don\u2019t normally go to the gym, I don\u2019t know that I\u2019d pick up the habit now. I definitely would find time to get some counseling. I\u2019m certain you can get away for an hour once a week without her suspecting anything. I\u2019d also keep copies of anything you get from her phone or credit card bills/bank statements with your family if possible. A brother or a father will be your best secret keeper. \n1- Find a safe place to keep the evidence (out of your house)\n2- Find a lawyer\n3- Find a therapist\n4- Beat of luck my friend.",

I suspect that she's not trying to get out of your marriage, but trying to get her needs met, whatever they are, and yet stay married to you. \n\nNo one person can meet all the needs of another person. And think of the children. It's going to be a rocky time no matter what, and you'll both need a lot of therapy and time if you decide to stay married, but figuring out her issues and figuring out how both of you can get your needs met in your marriage will require effort. \n\nI wish you luck...",

I honestly feel like most people are mad because they wanted to cheat but didn't...hence revenge cheating. \n\nNot saying its a good situation, communication is key and she was obviously lacking something that you didn't notice, even of it was just excitement. And there's a lot pf sexy humans out there. Live a little. Monogamy doesn't work...everybody has cheated before. I don't believe any ody who says they haven't...maybe some asexual person but that's different.",

The relationship is the prize...and of that's all it took to end it... wasn't real anyways. \n \nNon monogamy isn't the future, it's just a part of human nature that has always existed. I'll admit it's easier to deal with in a same sex relationship since we are usually checking out the same people. But yes it requires communication....and being open without judgement.

Can\u2019t have it both ways. \n\nThat the wife is an awful person is why they\u2019ll likely get divorced. Anger, hurt, fighting for his rights is all cool. Vengeance and revenge is a dark path and will have consequences on their ability to co-parent and will harm the kids. But hey, double down. It\u2019s an awesome look.",

Depending on how long ago this happened, you might not be thinking super clearly.  I would urge caution about making big life decisions while angry, which I most certainly was. This is much easier said than done, but, no matter what you decide to do, proceedwith care and try to think through your decisions first before going forward with anything.  For context with us: we ended up separating for about a year, going to counseling together and separately, but we kept things amicable during our separation and ended up getting back together. However, leaving her is also a viable alternative. My path isn\u2019t yours but I would urge conversation and keeping things as civil as possible.",
