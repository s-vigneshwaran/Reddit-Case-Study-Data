Have you actually looked at the [primate phylogenetic tree](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article/figure?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1001342.g002)? Apes are sister to the Old World Monkeys, and the ape/OWM clade is in turn sister to the New World Monkeys.\n\nApes are derived monkeys.

If you go back all the way to when the common ancestor of both humans and salmon lived, and you take whatever group that animal is categorised as, you can say that humans evolved from that group, as well as millions of other species. But if you have to go back that far, and take a group that large, why even categorise in the first place? The group of animals that look humanoid and is characterised by many human-like traits is a clear category. Within that group you can make a distinction between tail and no tail, but why? What difference does it make? It's supposed to signify an evolutionary step, but that step is smaller than going from ape to human. So it's rather meaningless.",

I myself think we should keep the term monkey, and call apes a type of monkey. I however do not think we need to keep the term fish in the science/cladistics part of our vocab and should use other terms instead.

Traditionally, all animals in the group now known as simians are counted as monkeys except the apes, a grouping known as paraphyletic; however in the broader sense based on cladistics, apes (Hominoidea) are also included, making the terms monkeys and simians synonyms in regard of their scope. Monkeys are divided into the families of New World monkeys (Platyrrhini) and Old World monkeys (Cercopithecidae in the strict sense; Catarrhini in the broad sense, which again includes apes).",

Great apes are part of the infraorder Simiiformes, which contains all animals \"traditionally\" called monkeys and apes. While there's been an effort to remove the word 'monkey' from definitions like Simiiformes and Catarrhini, it's hard to escape the fact that the great apes are fairly derived descendants of monkeys.\n\nIn the same way, all mammals are therapsids, and all therapsids are synapsids, and all synapsids are Amniotes, etc.",

Which is what i was implying.\n\n>You aren't \"tied down by the animal...\", you are an animal.\n\n\"Tied down by animal behaviour..\" doesn't mean humans aren't animals.\n\n\"Tied down\" doesn't mean \"not being\"\n\nIt means bound by, or shackled by.\n\nI can see the confusion which can arise, but that's only if you treat \"animal\" as a taxonomic category.\n\n\"Animal\" here can mean a less noble existence.\n\nHowever, even if you treat it as a taxonomic category, the sentence still works.\n\nAs an example-\n\n\"Humans are bound to their physical forms\"\n\nIs a correct sentence, even if humans are always a physical existence.\n\n>There's nothing special about it.\n\nThat's not true. Humans are unique amongst all life, like sharks or jellyfish are.\n\nIt also depends on your definition of special.\n\nLastly humans are the only animals capable of moral reasoning, which is a distinctly unique feature amongst all animals.",

But I sense this discussion is not amounting to anything, so if you want to write a rebuttal feel free, but I am signing off for the night. Feel free to send me your scientific source on how vaccinated people are spreading at the same rate as unvaccinated, if you find one. Goodnight mate",

Of course the whole driving factor of fear of Galileo was due to the growing Protestant scare, I don\u2019t think anyone is going to deny that, but it wasn\u2019t as if the church was going around throwing scientists in prison and executing them, they were the leading sponsors after all.  His book after the inquisition was endorsed by the pope at the time, who actually was against the earlier trial and supported Galileo, but only under the condition that it didn\u2019t directly advocate heliocentrism, only gave arguments for and against each system.  The ensuing mess where his book was interpreted in different ways is still somewhat unclear, but yeah I\u2019d 100% agree that some people were using the whole process as a way to get Galileo to shut up and thought of the whole thing as challenging the Bible.",

The parallax question isn't exactly found in the Bible.\n\n>His inquisition\u2019s debate was mostly focused on mathematical and not scriptural arguments, and Galileo could not prove heliocentrism\n\nThe inquisitions judgement explicitly referenced scripture, calling heliocentrism \"foolish and absurd in philosophy, and formally heretical since it explicitly contradicts in many places the sense of Holy Scripture\". They outlawed it.\n\n>Galileo could not prove heliocentrism\n\nHe wasn't trying to. Galileo didn't even support heliocentrism until his astronomical observations. But he did provide some very compelling evidence for Copernicus' model, which greatly simplified the prevailing Ptolemaic model at the time that simply accounted for discrepancies with the geocentric model by adding individual orbital circles for planets.\n\n>some people were using the whole process as a way to get Galileo to shut up\n\nNot some. The prevailing body of the church leadership at the time. There were many critics of the church but not all of them were famously tried and died of imprisonment.",

I don't believe in God, but I can see the logic in that idea.  The problem with that is, however, that not everyone gets to use their free will.  Throughout human history, there have been billions of people who lived terrible lives and died due to circumstances that were entirely outside of their control.  They were little children who never had the chance to exert their free will, so it didn't mean shit to them.  If God allows that to happen, then his justification for not creating a more welcoming world is nonsense.",

He knows if you are going to heaven or hell.\n\nHe literally lets people who he knows will just end up in hell be born. Which completely defeats free will. He knows everything we will do in our life so how do we have free will if something can just read our life like a script?\n\nEven if he didn\u2019t know the future (which again invalidates free will) then concept of both heaven and hell are ridiculous.\n\nHell you burn for eternity. Literally billions, trillions of years and even then it doesn\u2019t stop. To the point in comparison your life was just a speck of time in your existence. All you know is hell at this point, barely able to recall the life you supposedly lived all that time ago. A live that you can barely recall, but what you can recall is that you were a good person who donated money to charity and helped people around you and just made people happy. But you didn\u2019t believe in this \u201cloving god\u201d so all you know now is pain...forever. Yeah that seems fair.\n\nNo finite crime deserves an infinite punishment. Which is also not even punishment, it\u2019s just torture. Punishment implies learning a lesson, how can you apply that lesson if you don\u2019t get another chance?\n\nHeaven isn\u2019t much better. No pain or grief in heaven. You could be Christian and your partner could be another faith or atheist. You both get murdered and the murderer repents later on in life. You go to heaven your partner goes to hell and your murderer goes to heaven. And you are just totally fine with it. Because there is no grief in heaven, so you are stripped of your human emotions. You aren\u2019t you anymore. Heaven removes your ability to be human and you just have a grand ol tome with your murderer while your partner burns in hell, and you don\u2019t even care. That is just as terrifying to me as hell.\n\nBoth options are terrifying and make absolutely no sense, regardless of the fact that we are already predestined to go to heaven or hell since the beginning.",

I don\u2019t want to be forced to be happy. The sad moments in our life is what gives happy moments their glory. Life is a balance and if you take away one side, then the other loses its meaning. Plus the Bible says there won\u2019t be any suffering in heaven. And even if there is then that means I would likely have to live forever knowing some of my loved ones are burning in hell forever for really no reason.\n\nAlso the Bible says heaven is a city built for worship. I have no desire to worship anything. So what if he created me? My parents physically created me, I\u2019m not worshiping them. Plus there is thousands of religions and over 200 denominations of Christianity. How do you know you follow the right one? Everyone from every religion says they feel like they have a connection with their god. There are near death experiences from each religion. You have the same chance of being right about god as a Muslim has about Allah.\n\nI just fail to see how you can follow a religion that has an infinite hell, that\u2019s like supporting the death penalty for every crime on earth. Absolutely insane.\n\nI also fail to see how you can follow a religion that promotes slavery, is sexist towards women, and even says that if a man rapes a woman then he is to pay her father money and forced to marry her.

Most of them had churches as their patrons, because historically churches supported scientific endeavors. And yet, along with them, there have been plenty of scientists and natural philosophers who doubted or disbelieved the religious theories of the day. Giordano Bruno is one who's probably most worthy of being remembered, as his beliefs on religious matters are clear, whereas we're not entirely sure what ancient natural philosophers believed.\n\nFaith has nothing to do with one's intelligence level. There are plenty of pigheaded and ignorant religious people, just as there are plenty of pigheaded and ignorant atheists.\n\nFor example, you think having faith makes someone less intelligent, and yet can't spell the word \"your.\"",

Albert Einstein believed in Spinoza's pantheistic idea of God, which is one I find attractive.\n\nArthur Compton both won the Nobel prize in Physics, and lectured on religion, writing books from a Presbyterian perspective.\n\nFrancis Collins, who led the Human Genome Project, is extremely devout, and was friends with Hitchens.\n\nNobel Laureate John Eccles who helped develop our understanding of the Synapse was a devout Roman Catholic.\n\n[Pew research recently did a study](https://www.pewforum.org/2009/11/05/scientists-and-belief/) showing that about 41% of scientists are some variety of non-theistic, with 33% being religious and another 18% holding some other spiritual views about a higher power.\n\nThe majority of American scientists are theistic. Certainly, there are more atheists among them, and that shouldn't be surprising based on the way a lot of scientists think.\n\nBut even among scientists, non-theists are not the majority. And interestingly, younger scientists (18-24) are more religious than older ones, with 42% being members of some sort of religious group, 24% expressing some other form of spiritual belief, and only 32% being non theistic.\n\nThe scientists of today and tomorrow still include a very large number of religious people.\n\nLots and lots of scientists famous and not absolutely do continue to have religious beliefs. But they also believe in science.\n\nThe two things are not incompatible at all.\n\nThere are certainly some religious people who are pig headed and ignorant who refuse to accept science, but I've also met atheist anti-vaxxers. So there are pig headed and ignorant atheists too.\n\nYou're not inherently more intelligent or moral because of what you believe about religion and spirituality.",

The Bible is full of holes and people *will* use selective passages and disregard others. Of course if you look at the Bible from a sensible standpoint there are good values preached in it. But too many people approach it with bad faith and too many people already have accepted that the Bible states or allows for some of their shitty beliefs. You can be right all you want but it's not going to change the minds of the crazies in the US at least. It's too engrained and widespread. It's a big problem.",

The quick answer is I don't know if I believe in God, which makes me closer to agnostic, although I don't really think giving it a label addresses the complexity of the issue.\n\nThe slightly longer answer is that a disbelief in God is incompatible with religious Judaism, but not cultural Judaism. Since Jews are bound by more than religion (community, traditions, ethnicity) there are a fair amount of agnostic and even atheist Jews who self-identify as Jewish, though they may not be practicing in Judaism at large. Even when I was entirely secular I still partook in religious holidays like Passover and Rosh Hashana. For many it's part of their identity, and thankfully there are enough of us that it doesn't feel strange for me to have doubts about these kinds of things. Judaism also is a religion that is built on questions and debate (I watched a a long tiktok recently about whether or not Furbys are kosher) so I feel somewhat comfortable bringing up these types of questions.",

For one there are plenty of places in the world where you lack access to quality healthcare. But even beyond that, and you can Google for yourself it's more fun that way, but every time we change our lifestyle we also change biologically. One huge source of continuing evolution is our immune system, which has actually lead to a decrease in average body temperature in the last 200 years. But there are other things like losing our wisdom teeth, body hair and shrinking brain size for example and I'm sure others. And humans lifestyles will continue to change.\n\n\nNow you are right that some \"bad\" mutations might stick around longer than they would in a more brutal society but I would argue that just shows that evolution is continuing. Look at sickle cell for example, that is a \"bad\" mutation but it actually confers a benefit in a specific circumstance. Maybe someone will have a \"bad\" mutation that makes life on earth difficult and would normally be weeded out but actually makes them more able to adapt to life in low gravity? Maybe as the atmosphere burns up and we are all living in domes in 130 degree heat maybe we will evolve to be smaller. \n\n\nThe thing about evolution is that it never ever fucking stops. The conditions of what is \"fit\" might change, and maybe it can appear stagnant to the outside observer, but if you judge every kind of \"fit\" against the brutality of the wild then you're missing the point that it doesn't have any objective or purpose but is a mindless and continuous process that creates incredibly wonderful things.",

They're, at this day and age, both theories that can't be fully proven or disproven and both parties see their theory as absolute truth  because the theory was made by someone who excelled at their work.

No commandment says \"believe,\" just don't believe in any other gods - which I think is a very cool concept and highlights that Reform Judaism, especially, is much more about following the *spirit* of the Tanakh rather than the *word*. Religion can help us commit to upholding certain values, like environmentalism (Tu Bishvat, Sukkot), resistance to oppression (Purim, Chanukkah), and social justice (Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur). And believing in \u05d9\u05d9 isn't necessary to the belief in those values - religion can so many different things.  \n\nEdit: confused by your comment - I know very few people raised Reform who have \"defected\" (for a lack of a better word. Don't love the negative connotation there). I know lots of people raised Conservative or Orthodox who are no longer observant, though",

Some people hold out faith that there is more to life than what we can see/observe. Not to say that science is by any means wrong. But science is based off of what can be seen and observed. Faith is not. Also faith doesn\u2019t have to be linear.\n\nIf on day one you have a belief in a creator that created humans in 6 literal days.. but that as you start to understand science you begin to realize how that just doesn\u2019t jive with reality.. and subsequently your faith might change. Maybe that change just means our beliefs change over time.. or better yet our understanding of our own faith changes over time. You can use science to help better explain your own faith, for example accepting the possibility that the Bible used \u201c6 days of creation\u201d as in since \u201ceras\u201d of creation. \n\nI know that\u2019s a tangent but I\u2019m trying to help explain that by definition faith should be flexible.. although I understand that for many their faith is fixed and inflexible.. which is where you begin to see the negative aspects of faith and religion as practiced throughout human history.",

Not all people who \u201ccling to religion\u201d as you say are living life in fear of death and the lack of what comes beyond it.\n\nSome people cultivate faith and are completely reasonable and balanced people who understand that life is short and it\u2019s best to spend time caring for your family and friends and generally working to improve the lives of the people around you. \n\nWhat comes beyond that is always going to be a mystery until it\u2019s not. \n\n\nAlso, the strongest argument in my opinion for some sort of creator is the presence of altruism that you find in nature that has seemingly no evolutionary benefit for the individual persisting his/her genes. How does an ant have any possible concept of what it means to sacrifice himself to build that bridge of ant corpses you see when they\u2019re working together as a unit.\n\nOr the sheer crazy abilities of some animals to somehow grow appendages that look like other animals\u2026 like how does a tree stick with barely any eyes/vision evolve from some sort of lesser bug into a shape that looks 99.99% like a stick in nature. I understand the theory that natural selection guided it and after millions or billion of iterations it developed into that.. even that one example seems improbable\u2026 now multiply that by the millions of seemingly perfect circumstances we live under. Our sun is placed perfectly in the right place. Our moon pulls the tides in just the right way. It becomes more and more improbable with every single living creature that has these wild developments.. let alone the things that are not living per say.\n\nI\u2019m not saying science is wrong. Its one of the noblest pursuits man can strive for and I believe it is nearly the single most important thing for humanity to be driving. But the idea that faith is a waste of human brainpower is in itself a close-minded mindset.",

It's very difficult, if not impossible, to prove a negative, especially when the opposing typically includes omniscient and omnipotent beings.\n\nIt's rather dishonest to pretend that both possibilites have equal value- Nothing could ever *disprove* the existence of god, making the claim of its existence worthless, but it would be (theoretically) possible to *prove* the existence of god, making the claim that god does *not* exist falsifiable and therefore more valuable.

You can prove that something exists, but proving that something *doesn't* exist is practically impossible; If something exists you should be able to see some effect(s) of its existence that can't reasonably be explained by other means.\n\nYou've also hit the nail on the head with that question without realising it- A positive claim that is impossible to prove has little to no value and should be disregarded. \n\nI hope that even though you don't continue the discussion that you at least look at Karl Popper and epistemology.

Genesis states that God creates the world from chaos, so is our 1 in a trillion existence coincidence, or did some supernatural power want it to happen? We can only wonder until we have the technology to further explore the universe.\n\nI think more groups of Christians and Jews should use this line of thinking, and accept what scientists have observed. After all, even though scientists have discovered much, there is still an insurmountable amount of knowledge in the universe that can only be interpreted in our lifetimes through belief.",

The English professor not liking this analytic view and thinking he was clever said \u201cso, you\u2019re telling me, this woman beside you, the love of your life. That love is not anything but a scientific reaction?\u201d  The psych professor simply replied \u201cyes\u201d\n\n\nThe English professor went on to say how he didn\u2019t want to live like that, without the beauty and Romance of love as an ineffable magic. At the time I completely agreed with him\n\n\nAt the end of my fourth year I completed my degree in psychology and I completely agreed with the psych professor because after learning how the mind works I found a deeper understanding of self and life. I am more moved everyday by the Miracle of chemical/electrical reactions in my mind that after countless generations of evolution allow me to love. Thinking of the many stars that lived and died to produced the elements that became our earth, that eventually became the \u201capes\u201d that became your ancestors, who lived and died so that now you can experience this chemical reaction is incredible. I don\u2019t believe this negates the existence of a god or higher power,  but I feel bad for the people who\u2019s religions close their minds to this knowledge of the beauty that is their life.",

It\u2019s a logical argument based on our lack of understanding how the universe began and what came before it. But instead of recognizing that it\u2019s simply a lack of understanding, he jumped to the conclusion that it must have been god. People thought the same thing about lightning before scientists did the work to understand it. \n\nI actually wouldn\u2019t be surprised if one day we find out there really is / was a \u201cgod\u201d. A creator of everything. Science is certainly not done learning and increasing our understanding of the universe. But so far, there\u2019s no direct evidence that comes close to proving it.",

Not only does he not prove anything by it, it also shifts the burden of proof away from theists(where it belongs) and on to the atheist position\n\nThe funny part is that OP wants to use Russel's Teapot but essentially ends up comitting the same error in reasoning that was pointed out in Russel's Teapot.

It\u2019s impossible, because you can\u2019t disprove non existence.

That also is a bit of a contradiction of your narrative of \"its just these folks\"\n\nI agree with you that the people in the original post are daft. No problems there. The problems I'm having here are with the fact that it really, really seems like you just have an issue with religious people, because you can't resist but make some belittling comment every time you speak.

All of our science is based on these similar enough perceptions, that we hope allows us to see things the way they really are. But, we also know there are things our mind keeps us from noticing, remembering, or focusing on (for example the ways magicians pull off their tricks). Who is to say that a chemically altered perception may not produce a more or less accurate view of the truth or even provide access to hypotheses we didn't know could have been possible? \n\nI would say it may, and we often use chemicals to alter peoples' perceptions to be closer to what we think is truth (think schizo meds). Obviously though, an extreme amount of caution has to be taken with stuff like that and I think we're still several years away from seriously researching the interaction of perception and high doses of psychedelics. Though steps are being taken to quantify psychedelic experiences in order to be able to more easily study them, see \"the hyperbolic geometry of dmt experiences.\"",

Mainstream Christianity is corrupt I agree. And very hypocritical.  Race, sexuality, ideology and religion doesn\u2019t matter I\u2019ll treat everyone with respect even if I don\u2019t agree with their opinions or life choices bc that\u2019s what Jesus did he didn\u2019t judge those different from him he loved and loved all and that\u2019s how i try to be. Hopefully that clears up some stuff but I definitely agree that mainstream Christianity can b extremely toxic. I may not agree with homosexuality but I\u2019ll never be homophobic or rude to someone bc they are gay. I might not agree with them but I\u2019ll treat them with human decent and respect as everyone should",

Due to the fact they follow the \"rule of two\"(there have to be at least two witnesses or its thrown out.) And the fact that when sexual crimes are proved to the elders it is usually hidden to prevent controversy and if they do deal with it it is always internal and calling police are discouraged. Therefore it is impossible to know the sexual assault rates of the JWs. Which makes it all the more sketchy. I am not even getting into the fact the the \"new personality\" implanted into members tends to be made to ignore stuff like that. And lastly, you may wonder where I get my morals from. Simple answer, evolution. And no, nobody believe we magics from monkey's, the way it works is over millions of years animals better adapt to live in the situation they are in, and they can't devolve to be something better. Imagine it like climbing a hill, once you climb.the hill to where you are at you can't go down. It's why humans don't grow wings. No matter how useful the end product is, for a while we would have useless hands. While us and monkeys have a common ancestor, we split in different paths from each other millions of years ago. Now, morals. See, humans are social animals, and we need to work together. In the early days this was hunting together for food. Now, if you kill your hunting partner, you now have a lesser capacity to get food, and are more likely to get pushed away by the tribe. So by cooperating and not killing, each other, we developed an innate detail in our brain that realized that killing gets us less food, and less mates. So we got empathy. This is a really simple explanation, but it explains why animals like dogs,  monkeys, and apes can feel emotions and feel bad for what they have down, as well as angry without needing to teach them how to read the Bible. Think, monkeys have a social heirarchy and they know not to kill each other. If you need the Bible for morals how come animals that can't understand English have empathy  and morals?\nLook, I understand what you are in, and you are going to label me as an apostate(Greek for runaway slave), and that I hate you and am a spawn if the devil, but I just feel I need to say that I don't hate you, or your family. I dont \"hate\" any JW. I hate what your book has done to you. Turning good people into cogs in an industrial religion.",

I've been in and out of believing in God or not, it comes from my own doubt and reflection, and being shamed for something I believe in is just toxic.

I've seen so many beautiful things in this world that, in my own opinion at least, seem to be impossible without some intelligent design out there. I don't know if it's Odin's doing when he formed the planet and all its beings and wonders out of Ymir's remains, or maybe it's the doing of some other celestial being. But I just can't rap my head around the idea that everything in our world, our intelligence, the animals that surround us, the beautiful mountains and glacial fjords we have today, all came out of chance. I do believe that time has it's effect on our planet, I can see that everywhere I look. I've seen glaciers caving while I was in a sea kayak only a few hundred yards away. I've felt the force of the waters that come with it. I've felt the spray of a humpback on my face. And when I see and feel those sensations, I can't help but thank a greater being that put those animals on this planet. I believe in dinosaurs and all that cool stuff. I just don't believe in evolution. We don't know the reasoning the God/gods have. And I'm not saying the earth isn't as old as science says it is. Because for all I know, the dinosaurs could've been \"nuked\" because they would've interviewed with the plan to add humans into the world with the formation of Ask and Embla or Adam and Eve or whatever you want to believe. I don't think it to be arrogant or egotistical to have a belief in place about how the world came to be. Because of my beliefs, I choose to thank the animals I hunt for giving themselves to me. I respect the animals of the land and the fish of the seas.  And overall I have a high level of respect for this planet that we get to call home because of that.",

You forget about the tolerance paradox. Allowing too much nonsense from trying to be accepting only begets more nonsense. People always say let them do as they please so long as it doesn\u2019t hurt people, and that\u2019s fair, but then we end up conversion therapy and tons of abused children because the \u201cjust let them believe what they want\u201d stuff. Being too tolerant leads to other groups not being tolerant of people who don\u2019t fit their idea of what a person should be. Hence the situation in the US with evangelical nut jobs yeeting themselves and a chunk of their community into the grave because people let them peddle their nonsense.",

You just chose a much harder one to defend. \n\nThe logically correct claim to make against theists would be that God doesn't necessarily exist. For example I say my car is red and you say it isn't. If I don't have any pictures and we aren't near my car I can't prove it. However this does not mean that my car isn't red. It might be or it might not. \n\nAs for the inability to prove something doesn't exist: that's literally my point. If you can't prove it, how can you claim it for sure? How can you say for certain that God (or god's) isn't real?",

I read that as atheists at first, but I don't think it makes much of a difference.\n\nAn invisible pink cow is a silly stand-in for any entity that can be argued to exist though we have no means to detect it. Wittgenstein used a similar rhetorical device in a discussion with Bertrand Russell, refusing to accept there was no rhinoceros in their room. Which could be analogous to a reply that I cannot disprove the existence of an invisible pink cow and that, as any good empiricist, I ought not to deny the existence of any undetectable entity on the basis that I cannot detect it alone. \n\nHowever, I believe the credence tied to beliefs outweigh the importance of rather metaphysical concerns. I can attach a vanishingly-small credence to a belief rather than reject it entirely, which would be the proper thing to do. I can do so with the invisible pink cow and I can do so with the notion of god. Given the lack of empirical evidence of some creator, benevolent or otherwise, it would be sensible to afford the belief little credence.\n\nRejecting metaphysical claims that are rooted in tradition rather than evidence does not put one in a confounding position. Rejecting the belief does not require the same level of faith as accepting it. Which means that atheism, anti-theism, or whatever label you prefer is not as equally confounding a position as the reverse.\n\nHaving said all that, I believe religion to be important for cultural and psychological reasons and I have no interest in trying to persuade anyone into giving up their religious beliefs. I do, however, take issue with the norm whereby empirical/positivist stances are claimed to be the same thing as non-empirical/non-positivist stances.",

When it comes to the notion of the scientific process, I think Pierre-Simon LaPlace's almost-surely apocryphal answer to Napoleon's question as to where god could be found in his cosmological models will suffice: \"I had no need of that hypothesis.\" It feels rather indignant to excise god with Occam's razor but the fact remains that at least in \"his\" conventional image, god remains a rather shoddy hypothesis and there is no phenomenon that is best explained by reference to such a divine figure. So there's no need to even talk about using scientific methods to \"disprove\" god, because god is not a scientific model of any natural phenomenon.\n\n> I really like how you explained this and plan on copying it if you wouldn't mind.\n \nFeel free!",

The only sufficient method that could sufficiently demonstrate the validity of their claim would be the scientific method. If god is hidden outside of the natural, then they are barred from using the most reliable way to finding an answer to the validity of their claim.

Because if humans survive another couple thousand years they will be able to compare archived footage of animals now to new traits in animals present in the future.

      "text": "Can I just point out that since the bible was understood for about 1700 years of Christian theology as a largely metaphorical work, that the stories of Adam and Eve and Cain and Abel are actually an evolutionary metaphor about the agricultural revolution, and the switch from a hunter-gatherer way of life to a settled agrarian one, and the violent conflicts which came along with that. So evolution is sort of baked in to the stories here.\n\nAnd this has been widely understood for a relatively long time to be a story of human social evolution written in a time when humans tended to communicate ideas with myth and metaphor.\n\nBut in the 1700s people started getting mad that the Muslims had a literal holy book and started arguing the bible could be interpreted literally - when it was never meant to be - and that led to this giant mess where the majority of Christianity and its leadership believes in science and pretty much always has ^1, but we've got these religious fundamentalists who believe deeply heretical things that most Christians have always opposed who've gained power and influence in the United States and through mission work spread their insane death cult nonsense worldwide in exactly the same model that wealthy Saudis have used to spread radical fundamentalist Islam.\n\nRemember the Scopes Monkey Trial? John Scopes was a Methodist, and his own church enthusiastically funded his defense team. The fact that a church spent a lot of money to *defend* the teaching of evolution, because that church believes in building schools wherever it goes, is a largely forgotten part of this story.\n\n1 Galileo for example was arrested for being incredibly rude to the pope, not for any scientific theory, and the opposition to him was on scientific grounds. He was bringing in new science [which was being challenged by other scientists](https://aeon.co/ideas/opposition-to-galileo-was-scientific-not-just-religious). The reason this was happening is that the Catholic church had a tradition of finding all the young bright men out there and bringing them to cities to join universities so that superstitious people wouldn't accuse them of witchcraft under outdated Roman pagan laws and murder them. \n\nOh and by the way, the Roman Catholic Church always opposed the persecution of people for witchcraft because its official stance since the beginning, when it tried to get rid of Pagan-era laws banning witchcraft, was that \"Witches do not exist and Christians shouldn't believe in them.\"\n\nBut most of us from majority protestant countries have both seen people in the protestant tradition be anti-science and engage in witch hunts, so we've seen that in our own history, but we've also absorbed enlightenment era slurs against Roman Catholicism being anti-science. When in Italy doctors were being trained on donated bodies given special dispensation from the church, while in Scotland doctors were being trained on bodies obtained by Burke and Hare style grave heists.\n\nAlso, I'm not trying to pretend that Roman Catholics committed fewer atrocities or something. They opposed killing people for being witches but were pretty okay with killing people for being Jews, Muslims, or Protestants. Their whole inquisition thing actually banned inquisitors from questioning people about witchcraft (unless it was related to something like Catharism) because there were real things that the powers that be wanted to murder people for.",

I am here to inform a few others that might be interested to learn more. \n\nReading material involves The Private Science of Louis Pasteur (to understand his flawed experiments), in general read about Bechamp vs Pasteur and Terrain theory. What really makes you ill (Lester/Parker) is a good summary on how medical science knows very little about disease, only symptom suppression. Reading about exosomes/extracellular vesicles in particular (these are the actual viruses, which do not make you sick) is key, this is all new science of the last 25 years, proving Bechamp slowly right. Understand the Flexner Report, and its impacgt: how Rockefeller deliberately killed all natural medicine to pave the way for his chemicals: big pharma. Pleomorphism is a another fascinating subject, on how viruses-bacteria-moulds can morph back and forth into each other. \n\nBut first, apply the scientific method to virology. It will crumble at once. But of course, since germ theory is the basis for western medicine, and vaccines, this is a total no-go area. As said, truth is only for the few willing to research it, and able and humble enough to accept the conclusions. This requires letting go of your ego, and the idea that you know something. I know all too well. I was once filled with the false pride of knowledge.",

We don\u2019t know what drug caused it, but we are working vigorously to figure that out.\u201d",

He was put to death because he was perceived as a threat against Roman order by the high priest Caiaphas. Jerusalem was known to be a place of political uprising against Roman authority because the Jews were oppressed by the Romans. Jesus was viewed as fuel to that fire. Why would Jesus be viewed as fuel to that fire if he never advocated for violence against Caesar and he never disrespected Moses or the God of Israel?

Although no one observed those transformations, the indirect evidence is clear, unambiguous and compelling.\n\n\n       All sciences frequently rely on indirect evidence.

People can believe what they want and believing creationism by itself isn't likely to have much of an impact in anyone's life.\n\nBut the mindset that takes decades of extremely solid scientific work and throws that out of the window can be dangerous. Amongst the vast majority of experts evolution is a non controversial idea, the controversy exists almost entirely amongst a niche religious group and their non expert target market to whom they tend to sell alternatives to mainstream scientific ideas packaged up with moral and religious guidance. \n\nThe same way that something so solid as evolution can be denied, so can the science that impacts all of our daily lives like healthcare and the environment.",

Your arguments have to be in line with the religious narrative for them to accept it. And that is what makes the most sense. If you really believe that a book has been send to all of mankind by the one and only (but kinda three?) god than you should be consistent with the information you get from the book. \n\nSince I am Muslim I don\u2019t accept it either. Sure god could\u2019ve done it, but he chose not to. God could\u2019ve created us in anyway and there is nothing to be offended about. It doesn\u2019t matter what he created us from, because in comparison to him we are pretty much nothing anyway. The problem would be insulting gods way of creating.

So the simple description that objects attract each other with a force proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to their distance is a scientific law.  You are simply describing a natural phenomenon.  When I drop a rock, it falls to the ground.  This is a scientific law.  An idea for how/why that thing happens is a scientific hypothesis, and when a hypothesis has been demonstrated to be consistently accurate it is a scientific theory.\n\nSo saying \u201cdifferent species naturally developed over time\u201d is a scientific law.  We can observe their development in the fossil record.  Evolution is a scientific theory that describes exactly how that happened through natural selection and survival of the fittest, which has been tested and observed to be accurate.",
