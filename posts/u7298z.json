Which is different from castration which is only removal of the balls. But that's obviously not what we're talking about, we're being all metaphorical, of course. Metaphorically speaking, emasculation is a real thing insofar as The Patriarchy is a thing. So The Patriachy gets inside of you at an early age, like a penis! And even when it's gone it leaves a long lasting residue and possibly some (in this case psychological) diseases in it's wake, also like a penis!. These concepts being internalized in such a way lead them to be a centralized component to many male identifying peoples' (hence forth referred to an men) core psychology. In which case having that piece damaged (said men's feelings get hurt) can feel to some men as to be a removal of thier ability to be \"manly\" or thier projected image of masculinity. Thus we conclude that, metaphorically speaking of course, a man's feelings of emasculation can be and are completely valid. None of which actually matters in the case of this tweet (or whatever media it is, i forget) though, because they used the concept incorrectly. Any way I'm just rambling because of the narcotics I'm taking after being hurt at my very manly job. Please blur my name in the r/badphilosophy post. Have a great day!",
