I'm not crippled by the state of the world I live in; but to see a person above you offering a hand to \"help\" pull you out the pool they're screaming that you're drowning in, all the while hiding the hand that's holding you down in this faux emergency is exhausting and infuriating at times. \n\n\"Hello, sir! You're a victim, and for both of our sakes, I have a vested interest in ensuring you stay that way!\"",

Most of the music I've always loved has centered around unity, respect, energy, enthusiasm, comraderie, progressive politics, inclusiveness, and the working-class.\n\nWhat do you move onto from that to better yourself or \"grow up\"?",

That counter-culture is inherently fruitless and that people are ridiculous for associating punk identity with counter-cultural behavior? \n\nPunk is a part of \u201ccounter culture\u201d, but is more about the \u201ccounter\u201d than the \u201cculture\u201d. Punk is the music of dissent, it breaks down more than it builds up, and while I like punk music, it\u2019s more of an outlet for impotent rage than anything I\u2019d think of wearing around as an identity or culture of its own. \n\n\\> That classic punk subculture was just as stupid and backwards as current \"punk\" subculture? \n\nI think the nature of authority changes over time, and as culture becomes less ideologically homogenous punk becomes more confused and pointless, but I don\u2019t think that means all of it is stupid and backwards (many of its varied and inconsistent criticisms are often valid, though it rarely offers solutions). I think the idea making what you hate a significant outward-facing part of your identity is stupid and backwards, which punks often do.",

As people have said, my gay friends steer clear of all the parades and stuff, I asked some of them if they'd be going to any of the parades and their responses were all a form of \"fuck no, those people are weird.\" \n\nI also think that there's a feeling that all the pride stuff is kinda offensive to them, because you get a bunch of people defining their whole personality to being gay. My friends are so much more than just their sexuality and I don't think they like being completely defined by being gay.\n\nI get that it's hard for some kids to come out because there's such a stigma behind it, or at least was a stigma, do it might be helpful for them to not feel so alone, but it so very easily and quickly guess over the top, from \"we just want to be seen as equals\" and \"it's common enough and nothing to be worried about\" to the cringe and laughable shit like \"we need more rights\" and\"we deserve handouts\"",
