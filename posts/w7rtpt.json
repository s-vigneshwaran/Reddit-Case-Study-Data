I've never met a black person with dreads with stinky hair. In fact they usually smell fantastic.

It also helps with thermo-regulation and protecting your skin with a sort of buffer layer. These glands are right next to hair follicles, which is how the sebum gets out of your skin and onto your scalp, into your hair. When you wash your scalp with a detergent like shampoo, you are stripping your hair of sebum, so the sebaceous glands in turn produce more sebum. If you don't strip your hair of sebum every day, your sebaceous glands will produce less. There are many other reasons why your sebaceous glands could overproduce sebum, like for instance puberty, pregnancy, and hormonal imbalance. \n\nIt's not a myth. It's biology.",
