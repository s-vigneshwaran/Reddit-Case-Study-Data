They lead lives full of misery and don't like that other women have freedom to pursue their own dreams without being tied down. They have miserable sex lives and have never had an orgasm from their husbands so all women who enjoy sex are whores who need to keep their legs closed. They have had to struggle raising kid after kid when they really didn't want too so women who get an out are \"selfish\". They are infertile and wish for millions of orphans so they can go baby shopping more easily and hate that other women aren't serving them with their wombs. They don't like women's freedom because they missed out on it. And they don't like young women living their lives freely because it makes them angry at all the life they missed by being born in the wrong generation. So like a typical self centered narcicist they have to restrict and punish others to lift themselves up and control their negative emotions.",

War, death penalty, hell I've had conversations with Redditors who think trespassing is grounds for killing someone execution style.\n\nSo why do you care so much about these deaths? Do you remember being a fetus? Or being a globule of cells? No. Why is it wrong to nip a life in the bud and spare a child from being born into an overpopulated, suffering world where it was never wanted? Why should we force women to carry out a taxing bodily function that ends with her potentially having to care for a child she never wanted?\n\nI'll tell you why. Because people genuinely believe that women should not be able to have sex as frequently, pleasurably, and with as many partners as men can without consequences. \n\nAccess to abortions mean women have control over their destinies and lives. That they can be more than just potential baby factories. That all the pleasure and freedom men experience by not having the weight of a potential pregnancy hanging over their head can be theirs too. And that is what makes a just and fair society.\n\nYou will never convince me that abortions are not a moral death, that can be executed humanely and under safe conditions. A death that we as a society can and should become comfortable with.",

Even California restricts abortion after the fetus is viable to live outside of the mother's womb. Which is around 25 weeks or 6 months. \n\nLate-term abortions are typically only undertaken when the fetus is determined to be nonviable well into the third trimester and would die upon birth, or if the mother's health is in danger. \n\nFrankly, I'm fine with six months. Viability in my eyes should be the cut-off. And it gives women, particularly ones who are underaged or from an underserved community, who might not have adequate access to family planning and OBGYN services time to seek the help they need.\n\nAgain, I think this is a moral death and a net benefit to society and women's equality to have common sense abortion laws. I don't believe in a society that uses forced birth as a punishment for women who enjoy and seek out sex.",

He fared less well in the cities, averaging 32.3 percent in urban centers with populations over 100,000. However, in towns with fewer than 25,000 inhabitants he scored better, averaging 41.3 percent of the vote.

The federal government will continue to be infiltrated in order to be crippled from within, and may not be able to keep enforcing many laws nationwide (in my view there are fairly even odds with regard to which party is technically in control at that level, but their power will be diminished by increasing polarization regardless).\n\nMost likely long term scenario as I see it is that we'll have to start thinking of certain states as semi-hostile & mostly independent nations.  It's kinda always vacillated this way to some extent every so often, but I think it will get more intense.  I personally doubt the USA as we know it can hold together with the levels of division we're facing.

I know this story is about a crazy Gen Z, but the Boomers are pulling the strings behind this. I wouldn't be surprised to find out that their voting locations are only open middle of the day on Thursday and no mail ins. 50% of the population is not even represented in the votes. I think I read somewhere, on average only like 30% or less of the population votes, even in major elections. For state wide and local it varies, but in some places it much worse.",

There\u2019s a common narrative that Republicans are small-town hard-working religious people \u201cjust like you!\u201d and Democrats are rich city elitists who think we\u2019re all inbred morons, and want to take all our tax dollars and give it all to cities. So they\u2019ll vote for whoever has the R.\n\nProblem is, there\u2019s a kernel of truth is us not getting much for our tax dollars. Many small towns have neglected infrastructure. But that money is actually going to the military and tax breaks for the rich and their companies. But they purposely obscure that fact.\n\nSome will go further and claim Democrats kill babies, or use stereotypes of welfare queens or illegal aliens. But the bottom line is that more rural towns often feel like Republicans are the only ones who give a shit about them. They don\u2019t. But the condescending vitriol the left often spits at them isn\u2019t winning them over. I say this as someone who is now a left-wing atheist.",

The hate is what causes them.  Go after hate, spiteful political figures/commentators, not the tool used.\n\n46% of ALL GLOBAL FIREARMS owned by civilians are in America. Ban them and demand hand ins and you'll get a load of boat accident type runours.  There will be a black market and it will be worth a lot of money, just like how grandfathered in full auto weapons are\n\nThe nutjob in this post speaks for itself when talking about loss of freedom, whereas reddit is heavily left and heavily anti gun.  That's why my explanation for the latter was so much more detailed. Ultimately, I'm heavily left by American standards anyway, but I enjoy firearms and I feel like I should be able to enjoy them at the range **once I have proven myself proficient to a reasonable degree to the goverment** (shooting tests, loading/reloading/making safe tests, safety tests, theory exams etc)",

By the time of Christianity, the divide between the divine and the mortal had already been blurred to a great extent in Rome. The emperor was considered divine due to Julius Caesars supposed lineage from Venus, a connection that was further blown out of proportion to the point where the emperor's words were considered divine.\n\nAn atheist in such a climate for Rome was equivalent to an anarchist because the only reason the people follow a single man over the Senate (which still technically was the governing body) was because of Caesar and his supposed divinity.\n\nWe have to remember that Rome wasn't technically a theocracy, a lot of the educated, moneyed people of Rome didn't really believe in Caesar's divinity and only bestowed deification as an honor. A plebeian who didn't believe in the core system of governance of Rome was dangerous and was to be removed.\n\nThey thought atheists were dangerous not because of their atheism (a lot of writing from the time already espouses a type of indifference to the divine) but because of how antithetical it was to the emperor's power (who was still dictator by an act of the Senate, a position that can be revoked).",

You even had a jubilee at the Vatican in 2000. \n\nNow it\u2019s 2022 and JC doesn\u2019t look like He\u2019s coming back and you\u2019re NOT gonna make it to 3000 so your ship sailed to be around for the Rapture. This is why they\u2019re struggling to keep the crazy behind the eyes in check. It\u2019s also why Christianity is largely anti-environment and pushing policies that ultimately will hurt the planet: if they can make the planet uninhabitable then they can force Jesus\u2019s hand and force Him to come again.

Police having insane funding allowing for essentially militaristic resources increases the divide between police and non-police, perpetuates an army culture of being constantly threatened, and allows them to abuse and murder minorities with near-impunity. It also decreases available funding to psychological programs to help mental health, rehab programs to get people off drugs, and anti-poverty programs to allow people the funds to avoid crime. Making prison sentences lighter allows people in prison for non-violent crimes (which is the majority) to not have their lives destroyed, and a shift in prison sentences to focus on psychological treatment and skills building would decrease recidivism.\n\nLiving in a police state doesn't make society safer, it makes crime fester and get worse.",

So the majority of people in prison are in prison for reasons that aren't even violent or harmful to anybody. This is the understanding that drives an effort to make a rehabilitative justice system.\n\n3) Again, from a purely pragmatic point of view, a deterrence/punishment-based view of justice objectively leads to worse outcomes in terms of amount of crime because people leave prison and commit crime again because they haven't rehabilitated, so if you actually care about having a safer society with fewer criminals instead of jacking off over the concept of making the Socially Designated Bad Guys\u2122 suffer for the sake of it, you should want a rehabilitative justice system.

Better back ground checks,  in conjunction with better gun responsibility from gun owners. Most gun are stolen from people's homes and cars, and then end up on the street, which is irresponsible. Guns are a responsibility, if you own a gun you should have them locked up in a safe, that's just common sense, so people don't steal them, and so your kids don't take them to school, or play with them. This myth the left wants to bam gun or repeal the 2nd ammendment is just stupid. People need to be more responsible. Gun violence has gotten so much worse in the last decade. Just this year, the last I checked which was like a week or 2 ago, there's been 22 school shootings, which works out too one every ~6.8 days this years.\n\n>having medical care by raising taxes instead of making people pay for it thsemleves.\n\nUniversal Healthcare is totally doable, you think orr current system of for profit healthcare really works? Where people have to pay $60,000 just for having a baby in a hospital? God forbid your child has to spend a day in NICU then you have to pay upwards of $1,000,000. These prices are inflated, and aren't true prices. It sounds like a hippy thing to say, but you're literally being ripped off by the system.",

The Buffalo shooter did drill out the extended magazine lock on the ar15 he bought. \n\n>Why should say somebody unemployed and not paying taxes benefit from a system paid for by taxes?\n\nSo an unemployed person isn't deserving of medical care, that could potentially put him into a working position? \n\nThe system is broken.\n\nYou also ignored the statement regarding the fact there's  been at least 22 school shooting so far this year. Working out to one every 6.8 days. And That's from data 2 weeks ago, and the year isn't even half over. And that's only school shootings, I'm not counting mass shootings. There's a gun problem in the US. Charging gun owners after the fact is pointless. We have to start being proactive about the problem.",

Attempts need to be made to keep guns in the hands of only responsible gun owners. If they have any domestic violence, mental health issues, PTSD, anger issues, or anything else that would otherwise be deemed at risk, would need to be cleared by a state board or certified mental health professionals. We are all tired of seeing shootings. \n\n>People who pay for their medical care deserve medical care.\n\nThis is pointless, what good is paying your insurance, if you have a 8,000-11,000 dollar deductible that you don't even reach at the end of the year. The insurance I had at my last job was supposed to be \"good insurance\" and I don't see how anyone would ever actually be able to use it unless you actually had major surgery. \n\nGo speak to any Canadian, or people in European countries, and ask them about their Healthcare. They just goto the doctor when they need an X-ray. And they don't even get billed. Here? It costs me ~$500 just to get an x-ray of my shoulder.",

Also as I beleive many states states don't require youvto register your guns depending on your gun. I know texas is on the list for handguns and long rifles/shotguns \n\n>Europe or canada is great for people with high medical costs.

You don't complain about 250 million people who went through the US public education system because we're all better off for it. You would benefit from universal healthcare as well. It's not like it's something that you wouldn't use as well. I would pay you to use it. You would pay for me to use it. We all pay for each other.",

The US military budget for 2021 was 801 billion. Thats a massive amount over years that's been put towards weapons instead of public health projects.  Thats more than like the next top 19 countries put together. So the people that are closer to poverty, aren't able to properly get a hip replacement surgery? Or get they're ankle fixed and walk without pain because they don't have enough money. They would be better workers and be able to put more into the economy if there body was in better shape. \n\nJust wait until you fall down and shatter your knee and don't have the money to fix it, or you shatter your collar bone. If you have the money, great, congratulations, you're talking from a place of privilege and money people don't have that. Many people live paycheck to paycheck, they live in fear of breaking a bone, or getting into a car accident.",

You think you're better than somebody you know nothing about, based off a hypothetical conversation, because they're poor. \"They're poor so chances are, getting a surgery for them that they need is a bad idea.\"",

You talk about poor people like they're a third class. You talk about private schools like it's a possible goal for you to send kids their. Most people don't have the extra 10,000-30,000 laying around a year to send their kids to a private school. \n\nLet me guess, a lawyer? Banker? Doctor? Surgeon?

Why do you have a problem paying for public education. \n\n>More about if you do have kids you can pay to send them to school...whether its for politocal reasons or just a better education i have no interest in.\n\nAgain, for the people in poverty, who are already working, they don't have the money to send children to private schools. \n\nYou're out of touch dude",

Not to mention many give free meals because parents refuse to pay or provide a lunch. They are the selfish ones. How do you fix that issue? How would for profit be a mistake?

If you beleive private schools do it better, which they probably do, but that's what you pay an extra $30,000+ for a year for, you have the option of doing that. Your logic is outstanding on this issue. You think people with kids should be forced to pay to send their kids to private school. But at the same time, if they're unable to pay for surgery that would keep them from walking again, all you can say is \"sucks, they probably don't deserve it anyways.\"\n\nThis is the Dumbest hill to die on. Like honestly, I don't want to sound like some fucking cheese lord, but you sound so unpatriotic that you don't even want to pay taxes towards public schools so kids can goto school. So what? It's just lame. There's nothing you can say that's going to make me change my mind. How many people on the right are like this? I know youre not \"left\" because you said some jargon about the left \"banning\" guns earlier.\n\nAlso \"everyone paying their fair share\" includes you paying your taxes towards public schools so.....quit whining.",

The one thing the conservatives were spot on about years ago was that a second civil war is coming. The two versions of the future of the United States and by extension the future of the west are polar opposite\u2019s. Only one will be allowed to exist and one will be violently crushed and consigned to the dust bin of history. \n\nDo we want to be a truly free, compassionate, and educated society. One based on democratic socialist values where like Western Europe and in particular the Nordic countries people still create wealth and prosperity though not at the expense of the less fortunate and the wider world in general? Or are we going to be a dystopian christofascist oligarchy nightmare. A place where the top 1% of the 1% control everything. A society where conformity and religion imposes itself upon every aspect of society violently? \n\nThose are your choices people. Pretending you can simply vote these degenerate subhuman scumbags back under the rocks they crawled out from is the height of naivety. They\u2019re ready and willing and have already repeatedly demonstrated their willingness to use violence to meet their stated goals. Are you simply going to hope the right people are in positions of power to protect you are are you going to insure you have the means to protect yourselves and your neighbors?",

Sometimes people cause bad things\n\nHe literally said he wanted people to fight, during the trials, the people said \"I felt this is what trump wanted me to do.\" Or \"I felt like trump was going to come support us on this,\" they thought he was going to pardon him.\n\n>Let\u2019s just be thankful that the amount of destruction they incited was only 7%.\n\nThat's not how that works. They didn't incite the violence, after the protests, only 7% turned violent.\n\nJanuary 6th, was a direct event meant to stop a regularly held political process. It wasn't a protest March that lasted until curfew, that then dispersed, then the remaining dumbasses decided to get violent with the police, giving the entire movement a bad name. January 6th was all about stopping the election process, you literally can't compare BLM and January 6th in what their end goal was. People went in their with zip tie hand cuffs. They broke into a goverment building in the capitol of the nation, with the intent of stopping the certifying of electoral ballots. With threats on Pelosi, and Pences life. You really think BLM and Jan 6th are the same thing? And you're calling me bias? Lmao You're a clown. Funny man over here. Also, you didn't see any of bidens lawyer friends out there saying anything along the lines of \"trial by combat\" about BML.",

Facebook is designed to contain a lot of private and personal information, usually found in comments in the form of photos and names. This basically makes Facebook incompatible with the [rules of reddit](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205183175-Is-posting-someone-s-private-or-personal-information-okay-). \n\nHere are some alternatives...\n\n * if it's a photo you want to show, you can download it or screenshot it and upload it to an anonymous image file hosting website like imgur.com or minus.com. If it has some personal info on it, you should probably block that out (blur, black rectangles).  And don't forget to read the image rules on /r/atheism before posting.\n \n * if it's a special Facebook page, you can just mention its name and remind users to use the inner Facebook search engine\n\n * if it's a discussion, you can take a screenshot (and color out or blur names and faces) and upload it to some image file hosting website...  or you can copy/paste the text content\n\n * if it's a video, try looking for a copy of that video on some other website, like YouTube, it may already be posted. If you can't find it and can't download and upload the video somewhere else, the best idea is to summarize the points in the video or describe the relevant parts of it.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/atheism) if you have any questions or concerns.*",
