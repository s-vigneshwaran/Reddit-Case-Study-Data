  "text": "TIFU by masturbating after my wife had our son, now she thinks the house is haunted.\nSo I have recently become a father. My son is a week old and I have been home with mom and baby the whole time. Needless to say I was getting a little restless at home even with the lack of sleep that comes with a new kid. \n\nFor obvious reasons my wife and I couldn\u2019t pass the time in the bedroom as normal. Mainly due to the expected impact of childbirth. My son\u2019s huge head didn\u2019t help things. So I decided not to bother my wife and sleeping baby and slipped off to the bathroom with phone and lotion to discreetly take care of business. \n\nPerusing my go-to site I find the video of choice. First thing that pops up is an ad of a girl yelling \u201cOh Baby\u201d with the volume on my phone at full blast. I quickly turn it down and proceed to business. \n\nI return to my wife in the living room and all I see is shock on her face as he holds my son looking worried. I ask \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong\u201d fearing she is mad at me for taking care of business solo. She looked at me dead serious and said \u201cSomething whispered \u2018Hey baby\u2019 to our son after you left and now I\u2019m freaked out.\u201d\n\nFor some background my wife believes in ghosts/spirits as crazy as it sounds. She has told me about seeing odd things in our house and believing she heard people talking before. So this did not help and she is even more worried with our new addition. \n\nShe is currently burning sage through our house to \u2018remove the spirits.\u2019 I don\u2019t have the heart to tell her I was just horny and she overheard me watching porn. \n\nTL;DR: I tickled my pickle with no volume discipline and an ad played where the actress said \u2018baby.\u2019 Now my wife thinks our house is haunted and ghosts want to talk to our baby.",

It's fine to not be okay with that, it's also fine to not want to be in a relationship with someone who isn't. What's not fine is to conclude that that's stupid and to do it anyway while simply hiding it from your partner (even if that goes to the lengths of leaving them extremely anxious because the woman who just gave birth to your child a week ago thought she heard a ghost and you refuse to fess up). \n\nIt's creepy how many men in this thread are jumping to solutions that allow OP to keep hiding his porn usage, as if it's assumed that his wife isn't okay with it and also assumed that it doesn't matter what she's okay with because he can just lie about it.",

I also know women who resumed sex shortly after birth - usually because they felt they had to, or worse. There have been women raped by their own partner while still in the postnatal ward here.\n\nWould you want to have sex so soon after pushing a baby out of your genitals, still passing blood and lochia (that\u2019s bloody discharge, by the way), possibly having your genitals cut open or torn, possibly having stitches, still struggling to open your bowels without pain? It\u2019s hard to believe there are many women who are so horny while dealing with bleeding, leaking breasts, healing grazes, tears, episiotomies and caring for a fully reliant crying infant 24/7 and possibly also being their food source, that they simply must have PIV sex despite the risks. I mean Christ, if your wife has recently given birth and is that distracted by her sex drive, maybe you could just give her a few orgasms without sticking your penis in the exact source of pain?",

In regards to her organs still needing to heal I agree with that but it simply wasn't the case it seems at that time. She initiated things because she felt comfortable and had the desire, things started slow until she told me what more she wanted. A few weeks later at her follow up things were all good from the doctor.  We communicate very well and she knows exactly what I'm doing when I take 15 minutes alone so her feeling any sort of pressure I don't think was part of this decision making.\n\nEdit, I just want to add I agree with you btw",

I have definitely clogged >!your mom\u2019s!< drains with my cum\n\n\nEdit: joking aside, I once came in the toilet, flushed, and saw there was still cum stuck to the bottom of the bowl. I shit you not. I was pretty dehydrated at the time, and I think that made it thicker and stickier. I\u2019ve also cleaned the shower after I came in there and the residue was practically glue.\n\n\nI don\u2019t think cum would be enough to clog a shower drain that drains well. But if you cum in the shower every day, and there\u2019s also hairs and soap scum going down there, I think cum could be a contributing factor to a clog",

Sometimes, when I'm staying up late but she's ready for bed, she will sleep out on the couch while I play games on my computer. Not usually an issue, but sometimes I just wanna be in my own zone and maybe group up with some friends on Discord, so I just say \"can you go sleep in the bedroom?\" and she comes to my desk, says goodnight, and gives me my alone time.\n\nIf you and your partner enjoy being together all the time, that's fantastic for you. Some of us like to be alone or have our own time sometimes and that is OK too. That's exactly why I'm married to my wife and not yours. We all have our own preferences",

If you seem like you're having a mental break and saying you see ghosts everywhere... well, that would be something they'd want you to stay at the hospital for.   \n\n\nThe judgement is really similar to how we'd judge a religious person. Just because they say they talk to God doesn't automatically put them in the crazy category, but if that conversation seems a little less spiritual and more like it's actually happening, again, we'd want to do some evaluations to rule psychosis or schizophrenia out.   \n\n\nThere might be a personal feeling that people who believe in ghosts are not well and others make the same argument about the religious. It isn't the medical community's job to question the person's spiritual beliefs until it seems like it might be something medical. If we were to rule belief in ghosts as psychosis, we'd be treating 45% of Americans.

One of my best friends went into a hospital with postpartum psychosis believing she was Mohamed and that \u201csomebody\u201d was chasing her because her husband didn\u2019t take her seriously. They found her standing naked in the middle of the street in 8\u201d of snow, holding her new born baby because she was trying to get away from the the \u201csomebody\u201d who was chasing her. She spent 6 weeks in a mental hospital on all sorts of psych drugs. She\u2019s had 6 breaks with reality since then, and it\u2019s been 12 years. PLEASE show some humility and be gentle with your wife\u2019s mental health. You love her enough to be married and have a child. Love her enough to take responsibility for your mistake so she doesn\u2019t lose her grip on reality or potentially her mental stability for the rest of her life. I\u2019m begging you.",

That part just doesn't sit right.\n\nI've got a spicy take, but I'll challenge it with some generosity at the end.\n\nThe *instinctual* lack of openness is concerning enough to me (e.g. if it happens here, where else does this happen? Do they both do this? Etc.). I'm not talking, *\"red flag, relationship doomed, divorce.\"* I'm just talking *\"yellow flag, this sounds sad.\"*\n\nBut also, OP playing into the joke of her superstition in the comments?\n\nThe bit from OP about not having the heart to tell her feels like a disingenuous explanation. I'm curious how OP would respond if pressed on that. Like... why not just tell her? What is he actually concerned about? If she would be totally cool, and especially if it would relieve her superstitious trigger, then why the fuck not tell her? If she wouldn't be cool... why not? She doesn't approve? So OP has to jack off behind her back? OP even said he was initially scared she'd be upset about knowing what he was doing. Why? And why haven't they talked about and worked that out? \n\nI'm not asking for a perfect marriage. But, I don't see myself being totally happy if this is the type of dynamic that crops up in an intimate relationship that I commit my life to.\n\nBut, on second thought, this is how I might think about it in a vacuum. Context is probably important here, right? New baby, lack of sleep? That's life-changing chaos, I imagine. All hell could break loose in that state without actually being personal. Parents on edge, perhaps. I'd probably write off almost anything in this state of mind.\n\nEh, idk.",

Yes, her burning things is an act to repel what she believes are malicious spirits away from her home to protect her family.  But really, shame on yall and OP for thinking that's crazy.  One person's ritual acts are just as nutty as another's (my mother has routinely taken it upon herself to anoint every place I have lived - just because you don't subscribe to it; doesn't mean it doesn't work for them). \n\nSecondly!  Not everyone is cool with their SOs even the slightest bit masturbating to anybody  else other than them (porn).  Or even doing it solo thinking of them at all.  And also, recently given birth, could set that trigger and response to a much greater extreme.   We don't know, and OP didn't specify. The only person that can weight those 2 things are the OP.  \n\nSo, for some real advice, either you can simply fess up to your activities; or you can take it upon yourself to double protect the house in the manner of her choosing (face it, you called it crazy so you don't believe what she does) to ease her mind.\n\nEither way, you should support her and ask her how she'd like the house to be spiritually protected and do it.",

Experiences are also extremely subjective and not reliable or consistent from person to person.\n\nBecause of its subjective nature, someone's \"experience\" is not sufficient reason to believe in something like \"ghosts/spirits.\" The fact that ghosts *could* exist is not sufficient reason to believe that they do.\n\n> I wonder how many things we accept as fact now that were once something someone believed in without any evidence at the time\n\nThis is an interesting thought, but it doesn't really mean anything.

The mind is a wild, wild ride, sleep deprivation definitely did not help that. \n\nLike the others have said, just tell your wife that it wasn't a ghost. It will be the best thing you can do to reassure her. A mother's mind is totally bonkers and in ultra protective mode after birth. It's really the least you could do to make her feel ok, after what sounds like a traumatic birth. She's going to be feeling extra vulnerable and she will just want logic (some form of the truth) and protection to feel safe inside your home. \n\nWhat really helped me was imagining a golden protective bubble around our son and then extending it to further the boundary of the house. Whenever I felt scared that something was after him in my sleep deprivation, this made me feel in control of the situation and safe again. \n\nSeriously though, I would just tell her there was a random advert playing that said Oh baby which is why she heard hey baby. It can be totally innocent. \n\nThis is the ideal time to join in, in protecting your child together, whatever way she feels is necessary. It's a WILD ride being a first time mother. So scary and amazing all at once.",

One of his friends who was also into all that woo-woo shit and claimed to be a psychic/medium came over and did a \"reading\" after he moved in, and reported back that the house was full of good vibes and auras and all that jazz. My brother was none too happy when I told him the only reason my in-laws were able to afford buy that house as a rental property in the early 1990s was that a very, very gruesome murder-suicide had gone down in it right before they bought it, and the price was rock bottom. Needless to say, him and his Wiccan woo-woo friend ran around burning lot of fucking sage in that house for the next few days.",

No I didn't lie and said \"this rock does that\" I told them which rocks ward away negativity which would ruin a relationship or boost confidence, etc.\n\nDm me if you are interested.",

The movie trope of 'she lost her baby and now wants to steal mine' falls apart when you count how many actual real life people you know who've had miscarriages stillbirths etc without going completely off the rails. Dead people don't immediately go insane. They're still just people. Ghosts 'talking' to the kid is nothing to be worried about anyway, especially since the kid isn't old enough to even say whether he's hearing things or not. Even for a believer, shes overreacting.\n\nAnyway, you should tell her the truth. These things can very easily spiral otherwise. \n\nIf she still wants to take precautions to ease her own mind (my specific religious group does that with babies if there are dead relatives who might do harm, since we focus on ancestor spirits a lot more); clap three times in every corner, while having all doors and windows open. Sweep all the dust in the house over the threshold. Keep some protective crystals, amulets, religious symbols or whatever around the crib, although obviously not where the kid can grab anything. If she prays, just pray over the kid.\n\nUnless I'm mistaken, sage is actually pretty controversial due to something with the native americans. Just something to consider or research more, since idk the details. Also probably not great for the baby, and if she's worried about spirits attaching to him, saging the house wont really do anything.",
