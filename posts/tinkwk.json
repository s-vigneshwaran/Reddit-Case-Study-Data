  "text": "Tifu by eating candy in such a childish fashion that it caused my husband a panic attack and a 911 call\nThis is so stupid and it happened last night and I'm SURE we'll both laugh about eventually but husband is still kinda ticked... So I was being a trash goblin last night and staying up into the wee hours to eat easter candy and play video games, which I don't do that often.  Anyway, does anyone else enjoy robins eggs? Those neon colored malted milk ball eggs they sell this time of year? Well, as a kid I used to do this stupid thing where I would lick them and smear the color all over my lips because hey, free lipstick! Do not ask what compelled me to do this, but i did this last night with a blue one. Then of course because I am a trash goblin i forgot all about it, fell asleep slack jawed upright on the couch with the lights on and TV still going. Next thing I know theres shouting, panicking sounds, and I'm being shaken violently, and by the time I come to I see my husband fumbling with his phone? I kind of... flapped my arms angrilly and said something like \"whazwrongwitchyou?!\" Yeah, he had been about to call 911 because he just walked out on his wife passed out with blue lips, he thought I was choking. He was pretty incensed when I told him it was candy, it's the dumbest thing I've ever had to explain in our whole marriage.\n\nTL;DR: I accidentally did a candy coated immitation of the recently deceased causing my husband a panic attack and a near summoning of an ambulence.\n\nEDIT- Didn't expect this to be so popular, thanks for the awards, and the discussions on different candy eating rituals! My husband has steadied his nerves and is now just ribbing me mercilessly- not just for scaring him senseless, but also because I've been training for a triathalon and eating really healthily, so this lapse was extra grotesque.",

Aspiration pneumonia (inhaling anything that isn\u2019t air into your lungs, including drinks, food, etc) is a real thing that can & will kill you if the more immediate threat of literally choking to death doesn\u2019t get you first. Both of those things almost killed my little bro growing up cuz my parents aren\u2019t the brightest bulbs apparently. Checking on your mom in that situation was definitely good, the insides of your lungs really don\u2019t like anything that is not air (obviously lol) & with chocolate having such a high sugar content, aspiration pneumonia would have been real easy to develop if she had accidentally inhaled any of that M&M in her sleep.",

That way you can spread the budget around and still get a lot of quality. The best part of sci-fi is exploring intriguing concepts. Why spend 10 hour long episodes on 1 idea, when you can get 20 different stories with the same budget?\n\nI wish more sci-fi shows would go with the short anthology route. Black Mirror does a good job, but each hour has to have enough content for an hour. Some of the episodes just aren't worth the initial watch. \n\nMeanwhile, LD&R can made an episode about Santa being a lovecraftian monster who vomits gifts when children are good, and will eat them if they're bad.",

He specifically asked Netflix if he was safe to have a cliffhanger, and they said yes. \n\nNetflix did them dirty. \n\nThey released season 3 with no announcement or fanfare\u2014 they didn\u2019t advertise it AT ALL. Most of the show\u2019s fans were shocked to see it up\u2026 and, because The Santa Clarita Diet got next to no views in its first week, Netflix used that as an excuse to cancel them. \n\nI can appreciate the third season for what it is\u2026 and I think, in a lot of ways, that it was the best season yet. But I\u2019m still incredibly upset that the show-runners AND fans were fucked over so spectacularly. We have to be happy with what we got, but I\u2019ll always wonder *how* it would have ended, if Victor Fresco got his chance to do so.",

About 3 years into our relationship i am pregnant and hormonal and having a hard time sleeping and ask him if he minds sleeping on the couch so I could sleep better. He asked why and I said \"your snoring is keeping me up more than usual\". He laughed and said \"I dont snore!\". Dude was 100% convinced that he didnt snore at all.\n\nI laughed it off but didnt argue. He willingly moved to the couch and fell to sleep. About 20 minutes later his snoring starts up. And this man snores loud enough to rattle windows. So I start recording a video of me sitting in bed saying stuff like \"whats that sound? Are we being robbed? Is our house haunted?\". Then slowly walked out to the living-room. With night vision on, getting closer and closer to his sleeping face and bulldozer snoring.\n\nMessaged him the video first thing in the morning. He watched (and listened) to it over a bowl of cereal and ended of knocking his bowl over from laughing and his arms spazzing in surprise. Now he praises me as a superwoman for putting up with that for years without a single complaint. Occasionally when im super tired and not sleeping well he will offer to sleep on the couch just to help me out.",

Saw there was a loaded bowl on the shelf, sat down and toked a single toke. Coughed a couple times and right back up the stairs.\n\nWell, between the cough and quick pump up the stairs, my blood pressure went wonky and I made it to the sofa where I watched the world slow down and my vision pinhole and I went down into the sofa. I honestly couldn't have been there for more than 30 seconds, but they swear it was minutes....\n\nI woke up to my face stinging, my wife over me, and my eldest son on the phone with 911 telling them to \"SEND AN AMBULANCE NOW!\"\n\nI snatched the phone from his hand and beleyed that order explaining this is cool, I got this, it's a normal thing. Crisis averted.... \n\nMy face still fucking stings! \n\n\"Babe, why does my face hurt?\" \n\nWell, the only thing she could think of to wake me up was to slap the fucking shit out of me, and when that didn't do jack she screamed at my son to call 911.\n\nMy wife's only recourse to me being dead was to fucking slap me with all of her fear and make me come back!

I can usually tell right before it hits and grab something, my arms maintain their strength, at least enough to help hold me up, but my legs just go complete spaghetti. Always fun when other people are around IE at school working under the dash of an airplane. Got out and up, about to get off the wing onto the ground. Good thing I caught it or I probably would have fallen off the wing (small plane, would have been less then 3 feet, but that's still a 3 foot drop onto concrete)\n\nAFAIK there isn't really a good fix for it other then \"don't get up so fast\". You can probably get medication to help stabilize or change blood pressure, but I have no interest in that personally so I just deal with it. (I haven't really looked into a whole lot, so take that with a huge grain of salt. Actually make that grains of salt.)",

So I reached over to turn my lamp on and it didn't work. \"Damn, I'm still asleep.\" I can usually \"jolt\" myself awake when I realize that it's a false awakening, so I did just that. Then I reached over to turn my lamp on... didn't work. Still asleep.\n\nRinse and repeat a dozen times, I finally woke up and just ran to the bathroom. Flipped the light switch... nothing. Still asleep.\n\nA few more loops go by and I realize that in addition to needing to pee, I'm also super thirsty. I must've been sleeping with my mouth open.\n\nSo I _finally_ wake up and think, \"I can wait a minute to go to the bathroom, I gotta get some water first,\" and head to the kitchen. I stopped with my hand on the fridge door handle and said out loud, \"If this light doesn't turn on when I open the door I'm going to be really pissed off.\" I opened the door. The light didn't turn on. I punched the fridge a few times and woke up again.\n\nTurned my lamp on. Nothing. Still asleep. Again.\n\nA few more loops went by and I was basically screaming at that point, \"I JUST WANT TO WAKE UP AND USE THE DAMN BATHROOM!\"\n\nI was biting my hand, slapping myself in the face, punching my leg, anything to try to wake myself up.\n\nEventually I woke up and turned my lamp on. \n\nIt worked. \n\nFinally.\n\nI had to hobble into to the bathroom, but I finally got some relief.\n\nI was afraid to go back to sleep at that point so I just stayed up.\n\nIt may have only been a couple minutes, but it felt like several hours. By then end I was beginning to feel like the guy from Metallica's One music video. Like I was trapped in nightmare and would never wake up.\n\n>Oh and once I fell asleep on the sofa and I swear I was watching the show, I knew exactly what was happening I SAW the TV and then I woke up. I sat there like wtf.\n\nI've also done this but with the radio on, so my brain sort of made up a TV show that I was watching in the dream.",

And I hadn't seen it before.\n\nThe worst episode I had was drug induced (so yeah, my bad). I always thought I can't breath when I fell asleep. I also saw the walls turn to mold so there's that. But I really panicked after a while. I was so scared of falling asleep but I had been awake for 3 days straight and I really baldy needed to sleep. Never did that again. Lesson learned.",

Obviously my dad and family instantly flew out and everyone was worried and freaking out. He ended up being ok. The next year we present him with a joke award for injuring himself doing whatever it was he was doing and it's been a running joke ever since.  I was a kid at the time so I'm assuming no one ever told me the real story. \n\nThis though in this post, wife was never hurt or injured or in any danger, husband mistook blue food coloring for legitimately blue lips due to lack of oxygen. Blue food coloring came from candy she was eating like a child! He freaked, but she woke up assuring him she was OK. I would find that histerical lol. Definitely would go in the family newsletter next Christmas and make it a running joke. But it definitely does depend on the person I suppose.",

I licked two different colored m&Ms and stuck them lightly up my nose (because I'm classy af) when I took them out it left rings of blue and green on my nose. I stuffed the m&Ms in my mouth and we all laughed so hard I legitimately choked. If you haven't recently experienced choking, it often results in vomiting violently to clear your airways. So that's what happened and my boyfriend managed to catch it in his hands as I was running to the bathroom. I'd say it ruined the weekend but it really didn't, but it was kinda a signal we all needed to go to bed. At some point after I remember laugh-crying on the floor and he told me I was beautiful. It didn't quite make up for the embarrassment of barfing but it was a stellar attempt to make me feel better.",
