I wonder why they can't move on? or why they come in here and dig through this sub and work themselves up till they are frothing at the mouth? I just don't get it. they want to act like they've all ascended to some higher level of enlightenment but they produce shit like this that would probably be illegal if the roles were reversed. it's like the anarchist cookbook for disgruntled housewives lol",
