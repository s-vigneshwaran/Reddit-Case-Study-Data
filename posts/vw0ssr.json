I still remember I had to look up \"flowerbed\" a bunch of times, I kept forgetting what it meant! \n\nThen, as soon as I finished the book, I read it again, this time out loud, translating it on-the-fly for my then boyfriend, which probably took a a week or two, 4-8h per day. His English wasn't good enough to read it, and he didn't want to wait for over half a year until the Spanish translation was published. \n\nI've always been a voracious reader, but I would mostly read in Spanish and French. Harry Potter 5 was the book that helped me read comfortably in English. I remember trying and failing to read Lord of the Flies in English, because the language was too difficult, too nuanced. I tried again later, after Harry Potter 5, and suddenly I could focus on the story; the language had stopped being an obstacle. \n\nAnyway, for context for those who didn't know, the Spanish version was usually published a full 7-8 months after the English one. \n\nBook 5, English original: published 27 June 2003\n\nBook 5, Spanish translation: published 29 February 2004\n\nStrangely enough, the French only had to wait for 4 months for book 4, whereas Spaniards waited for 7 months:\n\nBook 4, English original: 8 July 2000\n\nBook 4, French version: 29 November 2000\n\nBook 4, Spanish version: 13 February 2001\n\nSo I remember that I read books 1-3 in Spanish, then book 4 in French (couldn't wait for Spanish version, but my English wasn't good enough yet), then books 5-7 in English (finally!).\n\nThe French version was a mindfuck. They chose to translate pretty much everything, so Hogwarts was Poudlard, portkeys were portoloins, and Ravenclaw was Sardaigle, for example. I understand why they made that decision, but it made reading the French version much more difficult for me!",

Similar to animated movies and shows containing jokes that go over the kids' heads, but that adults get.\n\nHarry Potter came out when I was an adult, and I love the books.  I have told anyone who read them as a kid, but hasen't reread them yet as an adult, to read them again because they'll get things they missed the first time.\n\nIt's mostly puns and hints given through names and Latin.  For instance, my stepdaughter read POA as a kid and didn't predict that the black dog was Sirius Black.  The clue is in the name, but if young kids don't know about the dog star, they won't get it.  And Phineas Nigellus being part of the Black family is hinted with his last name. \n\nAnd how many kids got the subtle hint/joke that Aberforth might have had a perverted relationship with his goats? \n\nBut yeah, that doesn't make it advanced reading anymore than the adult jokes in Shrek make it high-brow cinema that a kid wouldn't enjoy.",

For a good chunk of the following months I watched it repeatedly. A little while later my dad told me that they were making a sequel, and while the movie wouldn't be out for years, I could read the just-released book, which conveniently was at the library. He checked out The Lost World for me, which I read cover to cover, and then I went back and read the original Jurassic Park and most of Crichton's other books. I had read Goosebumps-type stuff before that, but I'm pretty sure that The Lost World was my first \"real\" novel. I thought it was amazing. By the time I was 10-11 I was probably reading more books than I do now.\n\nI'm glad that the OP seems to have gotten into reading for himself but I'm guessing that he never got the chance to enjoy it as a kid and that's unfortunate.",

The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Harry Potter truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Ron's existencial catchphrase \"Wingardia Levio-sah,\" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as JK Rowling's genius unfolds itself on their pages.

Like pre-Judy Blume stuff I read as a young teen before I got into Stephen King and long fantasy series.\n\nAfter they they gradually get bigger and darker until the last one which is a giant tome and has kids dying.\n\nBut for an adult, the series is really tough to get into because that first book is like something you'd read to a kid as a bedtime story.",

You can also practice the words you don't know via online decks, but it's more important not to overwhelm yourself. It's prolly even easier when the language is similar to your native language though",

In February this year I started making a concerted effort to sit and read even for just 20 minutes at a time, and it only took a few weeks before I was blowing through books. \n\nI did learn one very important lesson though- absolutely do not let sunk cost fallacy trap you with a book you hate. I was finishing two or three books a week and then got stuck on this one particular book that I loved til about the halfway mark and then it *really* lost me. I stopped reading entirely for maybe a month and a half and then picked it back up but made slow progress because I hated it so much. Life is too short! Just put the book you hate down! Now I have a couple going at once so I can switch if one gets tedious, and give myself time to decide if the other is worth continuing. Even with the slowdown, I\u2019ve finished 17 books so far this year  when I wasn\u2019t even reading one a year before.",

Whether it be a movie/tv show I have watched so many times it almost becomes background noise or music. I have the same issue when watching stuff, because then I need to do something with my hands.

She would scold me for coming home with 3-4 library books at a time, because, according to her, I'd never finish one let alone all of them before they had to be back in two weeks. She would sometimes say things that, much later, I realized indicated that she thought reading was universally difficult, because for her, it was.

I\u2019d say they wouldn\u2019t grasp order of the Phoenix or deathly hallows from a comprehension standpoint(ignoring the fact that they\u2019d miss all the story) but if you read them in order, I feel like each one would strengthen the readers ability and they should understand them.\n\nFelt it was very well put together in that manner",

There are some differing statistics out there surrounding adult literacy rates in the US, and depending on which ones are accurate it may actually be *even worse* than that.

Level of literacy correlates to so many things, from crime rates to income to overall health, and the level of literacy of parents correlates strongly to the level of literacy their children will have as adults. Even from a purely fiscal perspective, government spending on literacy programs provides a massive return on investment in terms of economic growth.\n\nBut that kind of social infrastructure spending would be communism or something I'm told, so obviously it's better that potentially more than 1 in 5 Americans spend their lives navigating the world based on pictures and the few basic words they can read.

NWEA tests actually are norm referenced, meaning they're based on a median-derived average to say where students are in relation to grade-level peers across the country. Lexiles, however, are based on \"complexity,\" and each state, or even school district, determines what Lexile level is appropriate for each specific grade level in partnership with and based on recommendations of the company that owns the Lexile, MetaMetrics. There are other older \"reading level\" systems, but Lexile is widely adopted and I think has become more accepted compared to competitors like F&P/Jan Richardson, though many schools mix the two frameworks, especially in early childhood education. \n\nThere's not really widely accepted \"grade levels\" for reading outside of these frameworks that are designed in order to be used to meet the individual needs of students and asses their reading ability in comparison to texts they might encounter- in short, the frameworks are much more accurate for assessing individual reading ability, and you might even be able to argue that the research theyre based on is being misapplied to develop so-called \"grade level reading bands\".",

[Replace all the things in brackets with your own city names and numbers!] \n\nedit: P.S. To any library administrators-- I'd love for any corrections for any better ways to advocate for this! \n\n\\>>> \n\nDear librarians!\n\nLibraries are my favorite place, thank you for this wonderful place in our community.\n\nI live in [YOUR CITY NAME], and I just came across this article:   \n[Low Literacy Levels Among U.S. Adults Could Be Costing The Economy $2.2 Trillion A Year](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeltnietzel/2020/09/09/low-literacy-levels-among-us-adults-could-be-costing-the-economy-22-trillion-a-year/?sh=5e029bc44c90)\n\nWhy I'm writing:\n\nAs a life long bookworm, I was very sad to read this... but then thought that it could be an untapped opportunity:\n\n> Areas with the lowest levels of literacy would see the largest gains.\n\n> States that have a disproportionate share of adults with low levels of literacy would gain the most economically from increasing literacy skills. For example, in Alabama, an estimated 61% of adults fall below Level 3 literacy on the PIACC. If they could be moved to Level 3, the gains would be 15.6% of Alabama\u2019s GDP.\n\nI tried to find [YOUR COUNTY NAME] numbers, and this is what I got:\nhttps://nces.ed.gov/surveys/piaac/skillsmap/\n\n[XX]% of [YOUR COUNTY] adults read at Level 1 PIACC or below, and [XX]% read at Level 2. \n\n(In case you want to reference what the levels stand for-- you have to be at level 3 to be functionally literate):  \n[PIAAC - What PIAAC Measures](https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/piaac/measure.asp#1_3)\n\n\nMy idea:\n\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=High+Low+book+list+for+adults\n\nI did a search for Adult Literacy book lists, and found a category called Hi-Lo -- High Interest, Low Reading Level Books. You have book clubs for children teens and adults, but what about adults that read at a children's level, and probably aren't interested in children's stories? **What if the library organized a book club for Hi-Lo readers?** Or toggle between Levels 1 and 2? \n\nI'd suggest partnering with a local **adult literacy organization** for outreach (I imagine low literate adults aren't usually checking out library events), but based on the first article above-- I wonder if we could also make a case to partner with, like the **mayor's office or county services** (like maybe asking a workforce development center to help promote the book club to their clients). Also, please, the **elementary school PTAs**-- the best way to have children to become readers is to grow up in a family of readers, right?\n\nI'm not a literacy policy expert, so I'm sure that there are many better ideas than mine out there. I know that other libraries have literacy programs, and I've seen a library with a dedicated wall for hi-lo books for their adult learning readers. I also identified two resource pages from the ALA.\n\n* https://www.ala.org/aboutala/offices/literacy-all-adult-literacy-your-library-successful-and-replicable-library-literacy-programs\n* https://literacy.ala.org/adult-literacy/\n\nOur culture places so much shame upon adults with low literacy that many would never seek help. I also couldn't easily find any literacy resources on your website, but I also think people who 'can' read don't identify themselves as illiterate and probably wouldn't see out those resources. Maybe this could be a 'fun' way to share some love and appreciation of stories and books, in a judgement free zone. Like, you wouldn't necessary need to be a low-level reader to enjoy these books (ie Graphic Novels like March, Kindred, Hyperbole and a Half), but the emphasis is that it's judgement free for anyone who is. (I admit to being a reading snob myself until I was a little more educated about literacy.)\n\nAdvanced idea, or maybe a side project-- actually this could be for everyone, not just hi lo readers: **Basic workshops to understand** Adulting 101: your medicaid / medical insurance, employment benefits, legal / court issues, or city legislative advocacy / civic participation. I think anyone could use some handholding here, but these are specific places where low literacy is a barrier to ensuring a positive outcome.\n\n\nI'd be interested in volunteering to help with this idea (as an organizer I hate when other people give me ideas that I have to carry out! :-) ). I'd also understand if you have to back burner this suggestion. But I hope you consider it at some point, maybe even like November for Family Literacy Month, and especially now that you can use the Forbes numbers above to make a case to the city or county for funding this program! \"The gains would be 15.6% of Alabama\u2019s GDP!\" (To be clear, I'm **agnostic about my actual book club idea. I just wish for more, better adult readers**, I'd be satisfied if you implemented any of the ALA suggestions, but especially for middle-level readers.) Imagine piloting a program that the rest of [YOUR STATE] could carry out. Jobs, economics, adult education, children's education-- there are so many co-benefits, multiplier benefits, in helping adults read better.\n\nThank you again for making [YOUR CITY] a more educated place!\n\nwith gratitude,   \nKamala Metamorph",

For a couple years in elementary school my daughter had a group of friends that loved to read, they traded books and her reading ability went from struggling, to above grade level in a matter of months.\n\nA couple kids moved away, COVID hit, and her reading stagnated. The biggest challenge is finding something she will actually read. Even when it's something she loves, so many books written for her age are really long (compared to what I grew up with), why are so many books aimed at 11 - 13-year-olds 300+ pages? I appreciate having longer books for more advanced readers, I do, but when a book sounds interesting and then it looks gigantic, I think it can be a deterrent.\n\nShe devours graphic novels, so I get her those to read on her own. I've gotten out the habit this last year since she returned to school, but we were sitting down and reading actual chapter books that were longer together. After a day at work, it takes physical energy to do it. There have been nights when I thought, \"one night off is fine.\" But one night turns into two and then we get out of the habit like right now...",

If you hand someone from the UK a passage of text to read out with words like 'trash can' instead of 'bin', or one where complex words ending in \"-lise\" used the US spelling of \"-lize\", or they dropped the u on words like 'colour', it might have tripped them up leading to the people doing the study thinking the UK is worse at reading, but in reality its just a regional difference thing.",

It seems most people i talk to also read a good bit in those years, i thought it was normal",

That summer I started the fourth book so I could be ready for the next movie. I was hooked and then read the fifth and sixth books, then went back and read the first three. I then started reading more books, and by the end of fourth grade I was reading at a middle school level. In fifth grade I decided to read the Lord of the Rings series, and while I certainly wasn\u2019t able to follow them perfectly I had enough of a framework from the movies to get the broad strokes. Because of Harry Potter I went from reading first grade level books to college level books within two years.",

Slytherin is sponsored brand new cool brooms that give them an advantage in Quidditch and it's painted as unfair. Harry gets given the exact same thing by prof Mc Gonagall, an awesome new Nimbus 2000 with which he could be an amazing seeker. (lets not even get into how fucking stupid Quidditch is, that'd just be nitpicking) These are literally the exact same actions, but Slitherin doing them is bad because they're bad, Griffindor doing them is good because they're good. This is awful writing and repeats in quite a few spots in the series.\n\nSpeaking of the good and bad teams, Rowling absolutely loves describing the people seen as bad in her books as ugly, even if they have the same traits as the people on the good tram. The Gursleys are reamed time and time again for being fat but oh mrs. Weasley is just plump, so endearing. The consistency and degree to which she demeans the appearance of what the bad people in her books is honestly astonishing, and I really don't think that teaching kids that all good people look good and all bad people look ugly is a good thing at all. \n\nThe writing of werewolves as an analogy of people with bloodborne illnesses like HIV is so terrible it's downright offensive.\n\nAnd then there's the seeming moral of doing nothing to improve the world, over the course of the series there are quite a few things revealed to be wrong with the wizarding world, many of which contributed to Voldemort being able to pull the shit he did. These social ills are all introduced and then totally brushed away, the gang deals with Voldemort but leaves everything else exactly the fucking same none of the underlying problems are at all even addressed with an attempt to be solved despite them all being shown at the end to be in positions of power, they all just sink into the same shitty system and become part of it. Fucking Hermione's wanting to do something about the house elves and then doing jack fucking shit later as minister of magic reads as \"protest and any kind of action is useless kids, just accept the shitty status quo\". And don't give me any of that oh they want to be slaves bullshit that's the same argument people used for real slaves and plenty of them were convinced of the same thing, Rowling still chose to write sapient slaves into her series and using real world pro slavery arguments but they're totally real this time... If you ignore the exceptions, is just writing slavery and choosing to have your characters be pro slavery. And that's not the only issue they didn't deal with either, just the biggest one.\n\nThere's plenty more things I could say, and more examples I could give, but yeah, Harry Potter is shit.",

Everybody else watched tv, played video games or had sports as their main hobby. \n\nCurrently i know one person that reads and that is my SO. I myself despise reading as i see it as being boring. I've tried it but i just cant. But there are definetely, even among our younger generations, folks that do indeed still read HP.",

Fr, adults obsessing over harry potter creep me out. Unless you have kids and are getting back into it for their sake, its just\u2026 odd. And its not because it can only be appreciated by kids, but its that you should be *bored* of it as an adult and *want* to move on to more challenging and intellectually stimulating books and hobbies\u2026. It just seems unhealthy to me to just stick with one thing your whole damn life. That isn\u2019t growth\u2026 thats mental illness.",

Just overkill. That particular book should have been edited down to, like 500 pages. I think the story was actually shortened for the movie, but they really should have let JK get the book edited in the first place. She's kind of a trudger - she gets everything plotted out and written down, and she ends up with a lot of extra material that doesn't add a lot to the story. Left to her own devices, her MO has been to take another 2 - 6 months to edit out the extraneous bs, but Warner Bros had to get the movie out there. \n\nJust my opinion - and it doesn't really address this person's idea that kids don't read.",
