  "text": "TIFU by buying a life size sex doll\nObligatory, I bought it 3 days ago\u2026 but I just got it today. \n\nSo\u2026 I have considered getting a doll before because ya know\u2026 it\u2019s tits and ass on demand. I justified it by saying it\u2019ll save me time from having to go out and get girls IRL blah blah. And also I kinda thought it\u2019d provide some company while I\u2019m home alone lol. \n\nI was looking at these $3,000 dolls and almost made the purchase but found a cheaper one for just around $1k. I couldn\u2019t justify spending $3k knowing that there would be a high chance I\u2019d regret it.\n\nIt came in a big box, I hauled it into my bedroom, it ways about 30kg.. I underestimated just how much that weighs. So I sliced open the box and started removing the packaging and I could see it\u2019s little fucking toes poking out and I was like\u2026 oh shit\u2026 here we go. Kept removing the packaging and of course I grabbed the tits as soon as I saw them. They\u2019re okay, but nothing like the real thing ofc. \n\nI pulled the cold corpse of a doll out of its box\u2026 it didn\u2019t have its head screwed on.. so I unwrapped the head, plonked that on.. and it\u2019s a half decent looking thing. Better than I was expecting tbh. I wasted no time sticking the electric warming stick up it\u2019s pussy, waited a few minutes, dumped it on the bed and.. well, we had a play. \n\nNgl\u2026 it\u2019s better than a hand or pocket pussy but believe me, once you \u201cfinish\u201d\u2026 you now have to wrestle it\u2019s cold body, clean what needs to be cleaned (in this case I unscrewed it\u2019s head and basically force fed it water in the sink lol). I hadn\u2019t yet thought\u2026 where tf do I store this thing. It\u2019s about 160cm tall\u2026 so I plonked it in my closet on a cabinet wrapped it in a blanket and Jesus Christ.. it looks like a corpse.. literally. I now have to walk in there every day to be greeted by a cold wrapped up corpse when I need to grab some clothes. The heck do I do with it, it\u2019s corpse or bye bye $1k. \n\ntl;dr: If you aren\u2019t actually THAT lonely and only getting a sex doll \u201cout of curiosity\u201d, there is a very big chance you\u2019ll regret it.",

We live in a small town where we know about everyone so we would go randomly dropping that corpse at our friends places (we're in our thirties everyone concerned have their own place no parents involved) during the night for them to find it in the morning. For a while it came back to us because they were aware of who was doing it (or at least took the guess that it was us) but once we left it in someone's creepy basement and it disappeared after that.",

I'm no lawyer, just seems like the sort of thing a cop and judge aren't going to have a good humor about. It IS super illegal to leave a child or baby unattended in the car. If you're doing this doll thing and someone tries to save the child thinking that's what you're doing, I'm sure you can still be charged for \"setting them up\" or \"entrapping\" them.\n\nEspecially if your explanation was \"oh I just keep it in the car for the carpool lane\". At the very least the person breaking your window will be let off without charges due to them displaying expected vigilance when it comes to the life/death of a child in danger.\n\nThe moral of the story is it is very unlikely to go well for you because your interpreted intention will be, at the mildest, not good.\n\nNow, if you took the doll and like, hid it in a backpack or something when you weren't using it to carpool, you might get away with it. But if it's in a baby carrier all the time, you're in for a bad time.",

Put some clothes on it, maybe give it a mask if you want (but I'd just recommend a face-hiding hat) and slap it in your passenger seat kinda leaning over a bit with the hat obscuring its face. \n\nWay cheaper, but just as effective.

You use them for one thing...   \n\n\nBrining yourself to an auto-erotic orgasm - or bringing someone else to one.   \n\n\nHow is a 6 foot tall silicon person-shaped fleshlight any different than one about the size of a big LED flashlight?   \n\n\nI find this defensiveness among people in insisting that there is a difference an interesting cultural observation.   \n\n\nWhat about the dick-sleeves that are shaped like the buttocks, asshole, vagina, and thighs of a woman? Are those LESS creepy than a sex doll, but MORE creepy than a vagina in a can? Where is the line that you cross from \"I'm just blowing a load,\" to \"I'm a lonely incel\"?   \n\n\nBeing that you're all armchair Internet Dr. Ruths - I'd like to get a clear ruling on this. \n\nI'm also curious who is downvoting me by gender... Is this mostly MEN making this statement, or mostly women.   \n\n\nIt is all very interesting - watching you demand that one sex toy is not like the others.",

I never told him that I found it until after he threw it away when we moved out of the condo. I tried not to tell him because I knew he would die of embarrassment.

Boston dynamics developed [robots in the human form factor with much of our range of motion](https://youtu.be/fn3KWM1kuAw) years ago. [Handed shearing auxetics](https://youtu.be/53NXnPTG9Ik) are now being applied to grant the fine motor control and range of motion of our hands.  Engineered Arts developed the [Ameca AI platform](https://youtu.be/IPukuYb9xWw) capable of super realistic facial expressions. And just a few weeks ago, roboticists at the University of Tokyo developed [artificial skin for robots that is soft and water repellent.](https://gizmodo.com/robot-finger-real-human-skin-1849006817) It actually used lab-grown skin cells to form an artificial epidermal layer. Granted, these technologies have yet to be combined together, but I would be surprised to not see something lifelike by 2035 with an exorbitant price tag. \n\n\nThe greatest challenge today is not the pretty face, but the sharp wit behind it. We still have yet to quantify consciousness and our attempts at faking it still leave much to be desired. There are rumblings from Google that they've solved all of the challenges in developing true intelligence, but there isn't a scrap of reputable evidence to back that up just yet. That alone might take us another 50 years. However, we will probably have something that can pass as conscious for a short time, which is all you need in the context of a robot brothel. Though, that does open up ethical concerns if they're ever upgraded with true AGI.",

That's what the manufacturers recommend, they include a douche in the box, but it's much easier and far, far cleaner to use a long pair of forceps, a couple small sponges, and some paper towel. Put a towel underneath and have a soft cloth handy to wipe up any spillage. Using the forceps to clamp the paper towels and sponges reach the back, paper towel out any residual fluids, scrub with a soapy sponge, then with a couple wet, non-soapy sponges to rinse everything out. A couple more paper towel passes to get as much moisture as you can out, let it air dry spread eagle, then powder and store. It takes maybe 5 minutes, and you can do it without having to carry it to and from the bathroom.",

And when you got your six pieces, you gotta get rid of them, because it's no good leaving it in the deep freeze for your mum to discover, now is it? Then I hear the best thing to do is feed them to pigs. You got to starve the pigs for a few days, then the sight of a chopped-up corpse will look like curry to a pisshead. You gotta shave the heads of your victims, and pull the teeth out for the sake of the piggies' digestion. You could do this afterwards, of course, but you don't want to go sievin' through pig shit, now do you? They will go through bone like *butter*. You need at least sixteen pigs to finish the job in one sitting, so be wary of any man who keeps a pig farm. They will go through a body that weighs 200 pounds in about eight minutes. That means that a single pig can consume two pounds of uncooked flesh every minute. Hence the expression, \u2018as greedy as a pig.\u2019\u201d\n\nGood ol\u2019 Brick Top.",

That will be OP in a few years.  \n\nAlso, put it in your bed, so rather than looking like a wrapped corpse, it's like a weeb fantasy in your bed.\n\nFinally.  That is some shitty design if you need to take the head out and wash it off.  They should include a removable cock sleeve.  But hey, I've never seen one in real life, so maybe I am missing something.  Or maybe I have a future in sex doll design.",

It's very cumbersome, literally dead weight that's hard to position. So while I had imagined having \"date nights\" with the doll on my couch, the reality is that mine just lies on my bed because she's impossible to move around without breaking my back. The other thing is that the skin is flimsy. One of the fingers broke off easily and you need material to repair it. Not to mention the \"bones\" of the fingers are twisted pieces of metal that bend easily but can also break off. Most of the nails fell off and the head frequently falls off. \n\nI know when/if I move, I'll eventually have to figure out what to do (I kept the box which was just cardboard) and it is admittedly embarrassing to have lying around when the maintenance crew come around. In that last instance, I have to just place a bunch of blankets over her and hope that they don't think I'm keeping a dead body around.\n\n\nThat said, I don't regret it. I like having a companion next to me at night. It does suck that half my bed is taken up but whatever. I'm an odd person to start so just the hassle of moving it around is the only thing that makes it a pain.",

OG Wallen got mad and tried to replicate his study in 2014, but only used 13 people per comparison group, and then said his findings were robust. The other research did a 62 study meta analysis of studies that used fMRI, excluding those that relied on self-report data.\n\nAnyway, it\u2019s obviously not settled, as science evolved, but Wallen did a really great job of getting the results of his study to influence popular canon. \n\nHere is a summary article. The individual papers can be found in their respective journals, as cited in the article. \n\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/universal-desire-men-and-women-respond-identically-to-erotic-images/",

Apparently the best thing to do is cut up a corpse into six pieces and pile it all together. And when you got your six pieces, you gotta get rid of them, because it's no good leaving it in the deep freeze for your mum to discover, now is it? Then I hear the best thing to do is feed them to pigs. You got to starve the pigs for a few days, then the sight of a chopped-up corpse will look like curry to a pisshead. You gotta shave the heads of your victims, and pull the teeth out for the sake of the piggies' digestion. You could do this afterwards, of course, but you don't want to go sievin' through pig shit, now do you? They will go through bone like butter. You need at least sixteen pigs to finish the job in one sitting, so be wary of any man who keeps a pig farm. They will go through a body that weighs 200 pounds in about eight minutes. That means that a single pig can consume two pounds of uncooked flesh every minute. Hence the expression, \u2018as greedy as a pig.\u2019\u201d",

You'll want her sitting on the couch, dressed in something sexxxy when you get home. Lulu has no warming tubes. Instead, Lulu has circuitry that warms her entire body in under 10 mins. Lulu is warm and soft, just like a real girl, but you don't have to buy her dinner! You can turn Lulu on while you're still at the office, or in the car on your way home to see Lulu.\n   \n   You'll save money because you're going to want to stay home with Lulu, while she takes excellent care of all your needs. Lulu does, whatever you want Lulu to do. With fully working joints you can position Lulu however you like. You can even lock one, or all of her joints, so there is never a need to hold them in position... Lulu has better places for you to put your hands. \n \n  Lulu can be controlled completely by voice, via your computer or smartphone. You can also use sets of commands that are triggered by one word. Lulu also comes with a 1000 word vocabulary! You can teach Lulu new words yourself, and you can also purchase sheets of 500, 1000, 1500, and 2500 words to add to Lulu's vocabulary. Any words you'd rather Lulu didn't use, simply uncheck them in the Lulu phone app. Lulu's app can easily be renamed and there are 35 different icons to choose from.\n\n   Don't you wish you'd bought Lulu instead? You could be regretting having spent 5x as much money, yay!! You bought cheap... you got cheap! Simple as that.\n\nSeriously tho, this one sounds like a keeper! Busy young men would go nuts for this top tier doll that is so much more than just a sex doll. \n\nThis would be a beautiful niche doll. The one people save for almost religiously, like saving for a house.\n\nWho can build Lulu? I have more great ideas for upgrades and additions =)\u2661\n\nEDITED: Paragraph spacing.",

Mental health is a fragile thing. If a plastic fuck doll allows them to simulate the intimacy they so desperately need, and chills them out enough that they're more stable in their socializing, then I think that's healthy. Of course, there's the risk that it will make things worse, but nothing ventured, nothing gained.\n\nI wonder how many women would be right out there being an unbridled mess to everyone if suddenly there were no more vibrators.

Sure, it absolutely has not worked out for You. But that really isn't the fault of the doll, or by extension that industry. It's giving, yet again, these dolls and their owners a less than favorable reputation. \n\nYou didn't know what you wanted, what options there were, such as removable vaginas for easier cleaning, etc. You could've gotten a torso, would've been cheaper, lighter, easier to manage, clean and store. \n\nYet you say you got a life-size doll to keep you company, as to not feel alone at home. That's a major appeal of these dolls after all. Hence why doll owners usually give their dolls names, to humanize them, dress them up, etc. \nThen you, however, go on to describe how you unscrewed her head and drowned it. \nThat is pretty messed up. \n\nYou would have been off a lot better with just a Fleshlight.\n\ntl;dr\nDon't paint humanoid dolls as creepy just because you didn't know what to do with it.",
