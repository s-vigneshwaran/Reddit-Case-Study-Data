Which is why they all died pretty fast to regular blasters when they got Order 66'd.\n\n- If you shoot a Jedi with a flamethrower, what's he gonna do, block it? Cool bro, you have a slim rare steak line on your otherwise well-done charred corpse. \n\n- You can snipe a Jedi from behind and he wouldn't know. Dead. The Force isn't spidey sense, it's just basically an aim assist to let you do super-parries, and some telekinesis. \n\n- Tank cannons. Ded. Bombs. Ded. Artillery. Ded. Regular firearms. Ded. If you fire a 3 round burst from an AR 15 into a Jedi, he can't physically move fast enough to block all 3 rounds consistently, and he can't reflect them back on you. I'm not sure if a lightsaber would really stop metal flying at you anyway. Even if it vaporized it, hot metal vapor would probably at least set your robes on fire. \n\n- Just spray a jedi with a fire extinguisher. He can't block it. Now he's blinded with a cloud of fire mcretardant. Okay so he can still see with \"the force\", but I lied. That isn't fire mcretardant, it's flammable. Set him on fire. wew ded. \n\n- You can spray a jedi with pretty much anything. Do Iranian style and spray him with acid like an unmasked woman. Hell even an animal like a skunk could fuck a jedi's shit up. \n\n- Also obviously the force only helps jedi in fighters in limited ways, so if they get shot down = ded. It doesn't help at all if they're on a ship and it gets turolasered. \n\n- Pretty sure you can just slip polonium in their food, too, Russian style. Idk even if they can use the force to neutralize poisons, they can't do shit against radiation.\n\nPretty much the only things the jedi are good at in fighting is stopping a small number of blaster bolts fired in front of them, sword fighting, and occasionally shoving someone with TK. You have to ignore all the bullshit from the new movies because it was all ass-pulled, like the Hodor Maneuver where 1 shitty ship can just lightspeed ram a fleet and it goes bye bye.",

Could they stop miles away? Probably not. But this series kinda just makes stuff up, so it\u2019s possible. I\u2019m shocked they can stop plasma shots in general, but 7 showed they could. As for a modern type of weapon, even if they sensed it and deflected it, they\u2019ll die, cause it\u2019ll just be shards.\n\nAt the end of the day, the force is stupid. Palpatine literally impregnated a woman using the force to make a super duper Jedi, who was Annakin. I don\u2019t even know where that lies in force powers, but he did it. So could they sense one miles away aiming at them? The answer is probably \u201chow strong is he with the force\u201d.",

Cool bro, you have a slim rare steak line on your otherwise well-done charred corpse. \n\nJump out the way, see Mace Windu Episode 2\n\n>- You can snipe a Jedi from behind and he wouldn't know. Dead. The Force isn't spidey sense, it's just basically an aim assist to let you do super-parries, and some telekinesis. \n\nA good Jedi would sense someone is about to snipe them, like when Anakin and Obi Wan sense the assassination attempt on Padme, also in Episode 2. Also it literally is Spidey sense which is limited precognition.\n\n>-Tank cannons. Ded. Bombs. Ded. Artillery. Ded. Regular firearms. Ded. If you fire a 3 round burst from an AR 15 into a Jedi, he can't physically move fast enough to block all 3 rounds consistently, and he can't reflect them back on you. I'm not sure if a lightsaber would really stop metal flying at you anyway. Even if it vaporized it, hot metal vapor would probably at least set your robes on fire. \n\nDarth Vader has definitely redirected shells in the comics. Also most force users can block physical projectiles with the force. The reason blaster bolts are more difficult is due to the fact they're plasma which is inherently unstable.\n\n>-Just spray a jedi with a fire extinguisher. He can't block it. Now he's blinded with a cloud of fire mcretardant. Okay so he can still see with \"the force\", but I lied. That isn't fire mcretardant, it's flammable. Set him on fire. wew ded. \n\nThey'd probably laugh at you, then use the force to repeatedly hit you in the face with your own fire extinguisher.\n\n>-You can spray a jedi with pretty much anything. Do Iranian style and spray him with acid like an unmasked woman. Hell even an animal like a skunk could fuck a jedi's shit up. \n\nA newbie force user could probably do something as basic as reactively force push acid away from them.\n\n>-Also obviously the force only helps jedi in fighters in limited ways, so if they get shot down = ded. It doesn't help at all if they're on a ship and it gets turolasered. \n\nI mean yes, but if it's a capital ship then a force user has more chance of escaping because of the precognition to help dodge hazards such as falling beams/fire. In a starfighter that they are in control of then they probably wouldn't get hit in the first place.\n\n>-Pretty sure you can just slip polonium in their food, too, Russian style. Idk even if they can use the force to neutralize poisons, they can't do shit against radiation.\n\nThey'd probably sense something was up, but if they trust you then maybe.\n\nI think the easiest way to kill a Jedi is a hostage situation. Just be like, I'm going to kill all these normies unless you do xyz",

      "text": "I'm trying to remember, but don't most of the Jedi fuck right off when one of these shows up? Like when Obi and Qui are escaping the ship in the first episode, they're merrily fucking up drones until a couple of these things show up and they run off. I don't recall the cartoon but I'm sure they're endlessly annihilated, but in the movies as \"Jedi area denial\" droids they aren't bad, unless the Jedi have numbers like in the bug coliseum they tend to prefer to just piss off somewhere else rather than try to take them on 1v1 or 1v2. At least they can hold their own for a short time instead of being so much wet paper like most other soldiers against a jedi.",

She had the tightest body and the perkiest little breasts in the galaxy; barely legal in most systems. Anakin and I used to doubleteam her at the end of every successful campaign during the Clone Wars, and once in a while we\u2019d even have the entire 501st run a train over her, part of official Jedi \u201ctraining\u201d of course. In time, she learned how to handle a meatsaber better than anyone in the Jedi Temple. She wore a miniskirt every day so we told her there were no panties in space, and since she was constantly doing acrobatics you\u2019d get a glimpse of her orange pussy mid fight as she\u2019d do a flip while slicing a B2 Super Battledroid in half. It was surreal. We taught her to grip her weapon backwards like a dildo and she constantly got captured by pirates and slavers almost every other day. It was ridiculous, like a constant porno Luke, you have no idea. And she was a good friend.",
