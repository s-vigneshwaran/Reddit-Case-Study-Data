If it's so mild like you're claiming, then why do they need a whole *TEAM* of nurses and doctors to look after them, to just do the bare minimum to keep them alive cos they can die from just sitting there otherwise?\n   \nIf you need a team of medically trained carers to monitor you 24/7 for the rest of your life to make sure you don't die, that means you're incredibly unwell.\n   \nThat just proves their point. If there really were no severe risks from this, then they wouldn't even have a team, because they wouldn't need one.\n  \nI don't know of many conditions that require a whole team of people, either. Like even if you've just had a heart transplant or something, they don't stay with you CONSTANTLY when you're recovering, they just periodically come to check on you again every so often. But with this they'd have to be in the same room with you all the time. \n   \nAnd who can actually afford to do this? Even outside the US, it's unlikely you're gonna be able to get a whole team of 10 nurses to be around you 24/7, even though you wouldn't have to pay for it. Even if you live in a care home, those places are usually *UNDERstaffed*, not overstaffed, and it's more like 1 person has to look after 10+ people at once, not the other way around with 10 nurses per patient.\n   \nSo even outside the US, very few people could afford to have a team like that. If you're disabled, most of the time you're gonna be earning less than healthy people. Unemployment is high among us in the disabled community. So only if you were already a billionaire could you afford a team of nurses. Nobody else could. Even millionaires probably couldn't afford it, because salaries alone would probably combined be a million a year and that'll eat through savings really fast, and you have to consider that they could be alive for decades still, decades of salaries to pay, and also it's 24/7 instead of a normal kind of job, so that'll cost even more because you can't be left alone even for a minute, even when you're sleeping, so you've gotta pay extra for all the shifts that are overnight and things like that, when already you're probably having to pay higher than the standard rate for nurses in order to attract them away from their hospital jobs and into this private job.\n   \nYet you're talking about it as if it's such an easy and cheap thing to just get a whole team of nurses. There's always more people in total than there are numbers of nurses. Nurses are always a smaller group compared to the total number of people in existence. So this just isn't gonna work.\n   \nBut yeah if you need a dedicated team of nurses, that just proves that you're incredibly unwell and prone to dying",
