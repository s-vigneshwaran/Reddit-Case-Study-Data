Hence, r/antiwomen.\n\n>it would be chauvinistic even if the person doesn\u2019t identify as chauvinistic\n\nTrue, because chauvinistic is a word with a specific meaning which can be used to describe things. If someone is acting chauvinistic, they are acting chauvinistic. How does this relate to the tweet?\n\n>you seem to be caught in this \u201cfeminism=equality\u201d\n\nHow is it not? Feminism is inherently based around equality, what you\u2019re describing is not feminism. Feminism is \u201cthe advocacy of women\u2019s rights on the basis of the equality of the sexes.\u201d Like your example with the word chauvinistic, if someone advocates for women\u2019s rights on the basis of the equality of the sexes, that means they are a feminist, regardless of whether or not they identify as such.",

They have literally never been oppressed as a whole. As for your male entitlement, I shall not apologize for calling you a misogynist because that is exactly what you are. You have very clearly displayed traditional beliefs and values. It's the same (of course on a bit of a lower level) as alt-right fascists claiming that white people are oppressed because they are, consciously or not, bitter that those who are oppressed are becoming less oppressed. It is hard arguing with someone who is so extraordinarily gullible to the point where they have so little self worth and decide to direct it towards hatred. I truly am sorry for whatever conditions you grew up in that may have made it that way. But you have control over yourself now, so it's time to stop acting like you're in a different century, and start seeing things as they are. A misogynist is someone who hates women. You claim to be insulted by me calling you this, but is it so far from the truth? Are you that blind? It's shocking and sad reading your comments. I wish you the best of luck on your perspective, and that's all I can do for now. You've made up your mind to be hateful, no matter what bullshit you spew about men being oppressed. Of liberals and conservatives, both of whom are awful, conservatives are the worst. I'm 99% sure you're conservative. Well, this became very off topic, but, again, I really, truly, not sarcastically pity you. I hope some day you move past taking sides and pointing fingers, and you see that everyone must stand together regardless of gender to fight for equality for all people and classes. I cannot respond to you any further, but please take a little of this to heart, my friend.",

Unfortunately you cannot see that feminism, by definition and in action, is advocacy for the equality of the genders. There may be some cases of misandry, but as a mass, it is nonexistant. There are plenty of abusive women out there, and that does need to stop, along with the few exceptions of women who do hate men. But it's not easy walking down the street and being scared simply for your life. It's terrifying when men violate you in public when you did nothing. And you can imagine, reading things like this and then some things that are just blatantly misogynistic is so incredibly infuriating. All I want is for the sexes to have equal rights, equal pay, and for us to be able to step outside our houses without constant anxiety. I wish men could step in our shoes for just one day. One singular day. Then they'd probably write about how men were forced into that position by women and how awful we are. I wish I were a man so I could live without fear and discrimination.",

VAWA gave women the power to \"phone in\" a male partner who is often arrested and removed from the residence even if there is no evidence he (or even ANYONE) is in danger. #metoo gave women the ability to ruin a a man's career and with mantra like #believewomen, do so even when it's based on  a false allegation. 3rd wave feminism is about full sexual autonomy for women while putting further limits and accountability on men for \\*their\\* behavior.\n\nFourth wave is about the next thing being targeted by the gender \"Oppression Police\"  - the idea that gender is a major source of discrimination and oppression and, like the family unit destroyed in the 2nd wave, can also be destroyed.\n\nFourth wave feminism is about pushing the new \"gender is a fluid social construct\" narrative. It's about turning all previously known ideas about what it means to be a man or a woman on it's head. It's about ensuring \"early child educations\" and \"gender professionals\" can groom small school children into getting gender reassignment surgery without their parents' knowledge or consent. Still reeling from the contradictory and often comical \"what defines a good man\" theories from the 3rd wave, the 4th wave is even more ludicrous from a male perspective.  It seems to suggest that penis owners should just shut up and disengage from society because \"we've had our turn\" and are just \"rapey exploiters\" anyways. One good thing about forth wave feminism is the high level of feminist infighting over the entire trans \"problem\". \"Woke\" feminists are SJWs who say trans women are women and to say otherwise is bigotry. \"Fundamental\" radical feminists say trans women were not born female, are not truly female, and can never be truly female or have truly female lived experiences. One point the radical feminists make is that a penis-equipped trans woman can rape other women with \"her\" penis when in the same jails. So, it's a neat little source of major infighting between \"woke\" feminists and \"radical\" feminists. Personally, I prefer a nice low-fat popcorn for watching these fights because I have yet to see any progress in the male fat acceptance movement for men because, oh wait, there will never BE such a movement for men. Body positivity is still a female and only female privilege.\n\nBut no, it's not about \"equality between the sexes\" and never was since somewhere towards the end of the 2nd wave.\n\n3rd and 4th wave feminism is Marxist brain cancer fighting against Woke SJW brain cancer. Let's see which cancer is stronger.\n\nFeminism is now about signing off on any sexual behavior women want to partake in, the furtherance of less due process for men accused of sexual-related crimes, de-construction of gender, and more insidious affirmative action and quota requirements for women, minorities and other \"marginalized\".\n\nIf you do spend all that time in modern feminist circles, that just proves what a bold-faced liar you are. Remember, we're not listening to the words of feminism (or women) any longer. We're watching your actions and actions speak louder than words.",

They have feminist writers who are able to successfully defend against all discourse. There are people who work FULL TIME on keeping the definitions of feminism \"neutral\" while ensuring words like \"MGTOW\" paint a picture of an alt-right woman killer.  Of course, they're not paid to do this work. Feminism hasn't toppled Patriarchy OR capitalism yet... *but one day...*\n\nSo, me nd my peers reject your sources.\n\nThey are not *peer reviewed.* By me. Or my peers.\n\n***See how that works?***\n\nOff to gender studies class with you.\n\nOH HOW DID I FORGET:\n\nAdd to fourth wave:\n\nStarted in 3rd but really gained traction in 4th.\n\nAs it became clear that \"Equal Opportunity\" was not giving women \"parity or better\" in all fields (and STEM is still untouchable) the new \"equity\" social constructionists went to work. Wage gap is now a thing of the past if you look at people under 25, where degreed women are out-earning their male counterparts. (Still waiting for feminists to explain how even though they have more money they have less buying power because of Patriarchy... oh wait they did that with Pink Razor Theory.)\n\n# Enter UNPAID LABOR.\n\nThree main unpaid labor speaking points.\n\n1. Emotional labor\n2. Unpaid domestic labor\n3. Unpaid child care\n\nSome suggest that organizing social aspects of work (that work doesn't really mandate) should be done on a voluntary basis - that no expectation of \"pay\" should be made. Could we do a draw at work to see who picks up the birthday cake for cake day at work? Sure we could. Or, like my office, cake day died a natural death when we started working without an \"Administrative Coordinator\". Guess it wasn't really all that important...\n\nUnpaid domestic labor, the biggest joke ever, is about women in relationships who do more work than their partners do. Why feminist women are even concerned at ALL about partnered women is beyond me. They are trying to politicize distribution of labor in people's relationships forgetting that many women (and many men) do ALL of their OWN domestic labor. So... paying someone to do their own laundry starts to sound quite ludicrous... and it  is. Society's answer has been \"Well, then stop doing it all, or leave the person\" aka a grown up solution. Feminists respond with tantrums about Patriarchy and how she is \"forced\" to do it.\n\nUnpaid Child care. Again, most adults think that parents need to figure out how to take care of their own kids. And again, if he's not pulling his weight, that sounds like a \"couples\" problem and not a taxpayers problem. But women want child rearing (and domestic chores) to be somehow included in the Gross National Product aka part of the economy. Well, sorry for this. Taxpayers are not paying you to do your own shit. They also don't like it being called into attention that a big reason for the (now defunct) wage gap is that men work more hours, she SHE has more hours in the day for what now? DOMESTIC WORK AND CHILD CARE.\n\n**Sorry can't believe I forgot the whole \"pay me for doing my laundry and taking care of my own children\" thing.**\n\nNow, if \"Patriarchy\" had you taking care of OTHER PEOPLE'S laundry or children \"for free\" then I might lend you an ear.\n\nTo feminist women thinking of starting family: Nobody is going to pay you to wash your own clothes and care for your own children. If you think being a wife and mother should be a PAID POSITION, take it up with YOUR HUSBAND.\n\nMEN: If she identifies as feminist, she will be a SHIT WIFE and SHIT MOTHER and always expecting to be paid for everything she does. DO NOT MARRY HER.\n\nlol thank you.",
