Lost, alone and afraid. \n\nYou paused contemplating the mysteries of the strange sky globe above you, which we humans call the moon, hammering your chest and emanating the calls of your ancestors - when an insane barber jumped from a trash can, clippers in hand. \n\nYou were shocked. Too distracted by the trash can lid itself, which you were, quite naturally, attempting to injest while muttering, \"Food good! Aaaargh aaaargh aaaaargh!\" while simultaneously and somewhat masterfully masterbating over a video of an iguana being run over by a fork lift truck.\n\nUnable to stop him with your flailing limbs, other than pushing him away, he partially shaved your head then fled for his own safety, when you erupted in a ball of rage, slapped him in the face and climbed the nearest eucalyptus tree to roost. \n\n10/10.
