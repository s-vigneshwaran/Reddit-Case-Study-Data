The more you fill your hole, the more whole you feel. But it's temporary and whenever you're finished, you feel more empty than before you began. It's a vicious cycle that lead to you being morbidly obese, negatively affecting your self esteem but reinforcing the need to eat. \n\nNow, after years of hiding your pain behind a curtain of sweet and sour deep fried pork, you've got one foot on the grave and the other getting one step closer to being cut off from type one diabetes at age 40. \n\nThe worst part of it all, comes before your inevitable hospitalization. Eventually, a woman will show interest in you. And it's going to be great, at first that is. For a bit, she'll look past the weight because you're a kind and big hearted (literally and figuratively, i think you may have an enlarged heart) fellow. Until she gets tired of being covered in three liters of sweat everytime you try to give her two minutes of love making before your too tired to stay on top. Then you can eat your pain away some more.",
