Carlsons dog whistles in support of such abhorrent ideologies are actually quite apparent, but he operates with the protection of politicians and political operatives who gain from his rhetoric.\n\nAnd here all this time I thought hate speech, or calls for political violence, were not protected by the First Amendment.  Seems we have a political party and movement that now benefits from that very hate speech, so now we are to accept that it is simple 'freedom of speech.'\n\nThat is such bullshit.  Speech intended to motivate radicals to perform terrorist acts is not protected speech and that is exactly what the last five years of Republican ideology banks on to give politicians that extra 5% boost on election day that puts them first over the finish line.\n\nAnd anyone who expects the GOP, led by the likes of Trump and McConnell, to suddenly denounce white nationalism as a curse on the nation, and call for the elimination of nazi ideology from it's foothold in modern Republicanism, is going to be waiting a while.\n\nOh, sure, they'll give it some lip service right now.  They will denounce the shooter and claim he does not represent their views.  They will place all blame on the individual and talk about how \"society radicalized him.\"  \n\nBut you can rest assured they will never in a million years just plainly and openly denounce the bullshit that goes on in places like Q-anon or 4chan, clearly calling it lies and unacceptable dogma.  The statements will be very carefully worded and cleverly crafted to sound superficially like opposition to white nationalism without ever specifically stating that they are opposed to white nationalism.  The official statements will contain plenty of room for reinterpretation to mean whatever suits the day down the road. \n\nAfter all, can't risk upsetting the base in an election year.",
