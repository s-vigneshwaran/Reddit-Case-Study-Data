I have a daughter and son, happily married 11 years and yes she actually has retained her eyesight all this time.  I don\u2019t drive a white van, but do have a white truck\u2026. In all reality I hate horses completely.  Birds aren\u2019t real and neither is Australia.  Y\u2019all literally made me laugh out loud with a few of these, glad I posted here cause you only YOLO once, amiright?  \n>\n>In all seriousness the show is called Cowboy Jack, we just hit over 1M views, and it\u2019s growing like a weed.  Started because we couldn\u2019t stand the junk our kids were watching and became our hobby.  It\u2019s extremely popular for families with kids on the spectrum, hopefully this will find a family it can help.  Roast on, suckers!\n\n---\nIf you think this bio helped you roast, upvote this comment. If you think it doesn\u2019t, downvote it. If you\u2019re not sure, leave it to others to decide.",

All in all, I\u2019d never do this again but it was entertaining to say the least.  I\u2019ll be praying for some of you \ud83d\ude02.  I do actually have a very satisfying career, great kids, a wife who puts up with me most of the time, and am lucky to have both parents who tell me they\u2019re proud of me.  The show is just for fun and doesn\u2019t make a dime.  I knew I\u2019d be a good target for the group and hopefully in some weird way it made you laugh to read through it.  Hope everybody has a very Merry Christmas and roast on, you need practice anyways. \n\nPS - 73.6% of all statistics are made up on the spot and 47.3% of people believe them.  Y\u2019all decide.",
