  "text": "TIFU by sending my daughter to school with a 3 MILLION SCOVILLE sandwich.\nTifu ...omg Reddit, I'm such an idiot. I'll start off by saying that my wife has very weak tastebuds. She can hardly taste anything unless they're on extremes of their flavour. Stupid salty, stupid spicy, ect. \n\nWell it's my job to get the kids ready for school, make lunches, get them dressed and out to the bus, then I go off to work. Well this particular day my wife was working an early shift so i decided to make her a lunch as well. I made ham sandwiches for all 3 lunches, 2 normal sandwiches for my daughter's and one sandwich with THE LAST DAB spread across thickly on both sides of the sandwich. I put them all into baggies and packed up.\n\nIf you don't know what The Last Dab is, its a hot sauce made by a popular YouTube channel that sits at 3 million SCOVILLE. It's not for the weak. It's powerful, it sets your whole body on fire and there isn't much to do but try milk and wait for the spice to pass. \n\nToday around 11:30, I got a call from my oldest daughter teacher saying she was in agony, that she vomited all over the floor and is in the nurse's office being assessed. I immediately knew what I did, left work and rushed to the school. I stopped at a gas station to get some whole milk and some thick milk chocolate to try and help her. I've heard chocolate works but never had the misfortune to try it. When I got there, the nurse had figured out what had happened and I got an earful from her about the dangers of spicy food for young kids and I could have done some damage. I agreed and I just let her go off on me while I was comforting my daughter becuase frankly....I deserved it.  \n\nI explained what happened to the principal who wanted to fill out and incident report. He was understanding that mistakes happen but also said this mistake could have been worse. Again, I agreed. Im so embarrassed.\n\nWhen I told my wife what had happened when she got home, she went to comfort our daughter, jokingly called me a huge moron, (I agreed) and we had a bit of a laugh with my 2 daughters over it.  My daughter has since recovered and I've learned a valuable lesson. \n\nDon't make radioactive sandwiches around food for your kids! \n\nTL:DR - I made my daughter sick by sending her with a supper spicy sandwich meant for my wife.",

                              "text": "So as she recalls it, my Omi was 19 and hitchhiking from her small town to Dresden in search of work. Rural Germany was the mess you\u2019d expect following WWII, and there had been occasional talk of several young women going missing in the region, but people less suspected anything sinister than they did runaways and secret boyfriends. My Omi got picked up several times by nice helpful people, none of whom were traveling the full distance she needed. The next person to pick her up was a lone middle aged man in a truck; not her first choice, but she hadn\u2019t seen any other vehicles all morning and he looked like every other local farmer, so in she got. She found it uncomfortable that he didn\u2019t make any effort to converse with her, and answered her attempts as shortly as possible. After a couple of minutes of long, awkward silence, he turned off the highway onto an unmarked side road. She asked if he was stopping at a farm or a village; he didn\u2019t answer. She felt a bolt of fear and said that if he was taking a detour, here was good, this was out of her way and she would rather keep walking on the main road; he didn\u2019t answer.\n\nMy grandmother felt an overwhelming urge to get out of the truck. She grabbed her bag, opened the door, and bailed out like a paratrooper. The second she hit the ground she jumped up and tore off running. She heard the truck stop and the man shout but didn\u2019t look back. He didn\u2019t chase her. She made her way back to the highway and ran back the way she\u2019d come, figuring he\u2019d look for her the way she\u2019d been going. Every time she heard a vehicle, she ran off the road and hid. When she reached the village where she\u2019d spent the previous night, she wandered up to the first house in such a daze that she just walked in the open back door. An elderly woman was sitting in the cross breeze shelling peas and immediately understood that something terrible had happened. She jumped up and made my Omi sit in her chair, got her water and something to eat (very generously, given the conditions!). My Omi doesn\u2019t remember what it was because she was so out of it she couldn\u2019t taste anything. She remembers noticing that and thinking how strange it was, and staring at the flower pattern of the kitchen curtains. She stayed there that night and the next morning, the old woman found a relative who was headed most of the way to Dresden the day after that. When they reached his destination, he helped my Omi find a ride the rest of the way with a friend of the shopkeeper he was delivering to.\n\nOmi continued to hitchhike as needed for several years but no longer accepted rides from any party that didn\u2019t include a woman or child, and she was highly vigilant while in the vehicle. She says she wasn\u2019t very assertive at that age and if she hadn\u2019t felt such intense fear that she couldn\u2019t resist it, she doesn\u2019t know what would have happened to her. Women continued to disappear from the area for a couple of years; she never saw the man again. To her knowledge, the cause of the disappearances was never resolved. She is extremely supportive of me being outspoken and taking martial arts. I highly recommend everyone trust their instincts and read [The Gift of Fear by Gavin de Becker](https://www.academia.edu/31891034/The_Gift_of_Fear)\n\nETA:\n\nShe knew a woman or a child passenger didn\u2019t guarantee safety, hence staying on guard during the rides. She always told her kids and grandkids not to hitchhike and to call her if we\u2019re stranded and would otherwise resort to it.\n\nAnd of the elderly woman who helped her - more badassery from grandmothers!",

He was forced into using the hat pin on one occasion, jammed it into the guy\u2019s neck, blood EVERYWHERE apparently. \n\nThinking she\u2019d killed him she felt guilty and went to the police the next day. She was told they were aware of it, he was still alive and not to worry, even if she had killed him they had better things to do, the guy was a known nasty scumbag and they really didn\u2019t care.",

She was talking about getting her hair cut once and apparently he said \"just don't go too short. Women shouldn't have short hair\"\n\nWell that comment didn't sit well with her so she went and got all her hair chopped off..\n\nAlso, one of my buddieswas raised by his great aunt, and when he turned 21 she took him and his friends out...apparently one of his buddies got a little too drunk and ended up telling his aunt she was an \"old bitch\"...they were sitting at the bar and this woman didn't even look at him, just swung her arm out and back handed this man right off his stool \ud83e\udd23",

They get two meals a day, and barely anything on the weekend. And it is *incredibly embarrassing* for these children to be labeled as in need of food. Kids will prioritize their reputation with peers higher than they will eating a full, healthy meal. All those kids you saw \"skipping\" lunch in school? Yeah, they most likely just didn't want to eat the \"poor kids\" food or for anyone to know they get reduced lunch. \n\nBullies are definitely out there, but next time you see a kid *just* stealing food, they literally may be putting in it their backpack to take home to their little sibling. It's a harsh fucking world out there.",

He ran the office's yearly chili cookoff too. The stolen from worried if they did something it could still get them in trouble.\n\nSo he had his wife drop him off while his car was \"in the shop\" and so he also brought his lunch.  Day 2, flaming face asshole is wailing in the bathroom and then eventually goes to HR.  Meanwhile chili guy notices and shows up and brashly complains that someone stole his sandwich ...\n\nThe best part was he left, went to the guys desk, took a picture, and got the other half of his fire sandwich and casually ate it in front of the thief while talking to HR.  (He didn't get in trouble, as planned, and the other guy got written up or something.  But thief wasn't around a few months later.  I think he got made fun of a lot after that...his wailing and moaning was...memorable.  Someone also bought \"spicy\" stickers and would put it on their food as a joking ward of sort.)",

So something like broken glass on the floor or a dangerous staircase or a trap, but not necessarily a trap. I could be wrong about that though.\n\nI think it\u2019s dumb though, if you break into someone\u2019s house or steal their food or whatever and get hurt doing so, then you 100% deserved it.\n\nEdit: unless you give them something they\u2019re allergic to. I have a food allergy so I understand that much. The best way to prevent it from happening to to not steal people\u2019s shit or break into their houses.",

You keep saying \"guests\" as though you're talking about like royalty, not friends/family or whatever.\n\nTwo, you made it pretty clear at the start that you aren't familiar with it. Not sure why you repeatedly saying you haven't seen it explains away anything you get told in response to that.\n\n\nThree, I have done it, and I know people who have done it. Do you bake? I know plenty of people who do and have done this. They like baking. They make some brownies, they're not going to eat them in a single day because no shit. They freeze them. Friends are coming over next saturday, cool we have some brownies while we hang out. You can leave them out to warm back up and retain their original texture way better, or you can make them warm with a burst in the microwave .\n\nThese are ***options***, not a list of \"what to do if you're hosting a gala in your garage\"\n\nThere is an official way to do this, it's not abnormal, it's not new, and you fuckin asked lmfao",

Or if you want to pre-make them for a party or because you\u2019re having people over, it\u2019s one less thing you need to prepare day of when you have a million other things to make. A lot of baked goods/breads can be made and frozen then thawed for a later date. Those are just a couple reasons off the top of my head.\n\nFor example, when I bake I make extra for family members/friends. I\u2019ll make 5 or 6 loaves of banana bread, 1 for us to eat fresh, I\u2019ll throw another one in the freezer for us whenever we\u2019re craving banana bread. The bread doesn\u2019t have a very long shelf life and will mold quickly, so if I\u2019m not going to see those people for a couple of weeks, I put theirs in the freezer as well. Let it thaw for an hour and it\u2019s exactly the same as when you first baked it.\n\nYou just have to make sure it\u2019s wrapped properly and you\u2019re good. I cook them, cool them to room temp, wrap them in parchment paper and again in a few layers of Saran Wrap, put them in freezer bags and you have fresh banana bread at any time! There is a time limit, I would say use them within 3 months.",

We all tell him it's a panic attack and that THC just simply can't hurt you like that and to just wait it out. But dude insists that he wants to goto the hospital. So, good friends we are, we take him and actually stick around, rather than just dropping him off. Doctor says (wouldn't ya know it?) that it's a panic attack and to just wait it out. 3 more hours pass, friend is starting to come down and feels very embarrassed about the whole thing.\n\nI guarantee half the weed smokers out there have some variant on this exact story. \n\nAlso, my intent in sharing this was not to minimize how scary a proper panic attack is nor how scary being way too high can be.

Never had a good experience in the 6-7 times I've tried (I know, I should have stopped trying after the first but my stoner friends were... pushy). \n\nGo to a house-warming party friend is throwing. Most of the people there are stoners. Common rooms with people are full of smoke. I don't mind as second hand doesn't bother me. At one point I get some food from the kitchen. I notice a cake. Long, thin single layer kind. Looks like spice cake and is about half eaten. I notice that it looks like people have taken chunks of the cake with forks from the imprints left. \"That's odd\" I think to myself \"why not just cut a section with a knife like normal people?\" I shrug and cut myself a generous chunk. I eat and rejoin party.\n\nLater I start feeling the cannabis effects hitting. I am speaking with another non-stoner friend and mention it. He tells me it's very smoky here and likely second hand. I reason he is right because I have smoked nothing. I decide to leave party early because the cannabis effects are getting stronger. My drive home is about 45 miles and mostly on the freeway. It hits hard and keeps getting worse as I'm driving. I'm so messed up now that I should not be driving. I'm alone in my car and lizard brain takes over. \"If you can make it home you will be fine.\" I somehow drive home, don't get into a wreck and manage to avoid any cops. I vaguely remember swerving in front of someone and them honking. At home I go straight to bed. I am feeling so awful. Vomit in bed at some point that night. Wake up the next day and am still stoned. Have an awful morning. Around noon effects are subsiding. I'm cleaning the bed and suddenly remember the cake...\n\nWhile yelling at friend that threw the party the next day he tells me he didn't mention the cake because \"I would not be interested in 'space cake.'\" for those that don't know space cake is a spice cake baked with hash oil. The stoners that knew about said cake were only eating single forkfuls because they knew how potent it was. \n\nMy friend and I were not on speaking terms for some time afterwards.",

She takes one look at him and says to me (because I was pretty much okay) that he needs to be in one of two places: back in the club or at a safe home he'd recognise.\n\nEnded up I brought man back to the flat and we watched Blackadder for about three hours, rest of them went back to the club in a taxi.

I didn't actually even read the label (not that it would have meant anything to me, as I don't watch Hot Ones), and dumped probably 1/5th of the bottle on my food (that's what i'd done with all the others and enjoyed it).\n\nMan, that sauce was no joke. It was just angry. Like, not particularly good, just angry heat. It actually made my stomach hurt for about half an hour, which I've never experienced from a hot sauce before, and my eyes actually teared up a little.\n\nI tried some again today (like, a dab, way less than earlier) and it was fine, but the heat was so raw it just wasn't very pleasant -- no flavor at all, just like eating pepper spray.",

The main ingredient seems to be vinegar, and the capsaicin seems to amplify the sour sensation. \n\nThat said, yeah, the capsaicin can cause the lining of your intestines to respond to the pain signals with inflammation, which then leads to diarrhea when the body tries to flush it out. And, since the water from that carries the capsaicin, it then spreads the sensation. \n\nI suspect that those who can tolerate massive levels of capsaicin like in the OP have the genetic anomaly where their pain receptors don't respond as strongly. This is on top of the usual downregulation you get from getting used to the spice.",

And why your sinuses open and eyes burn just from opening a bottle of very spicy sauces.\n\nThe wife may like spicy foods, and it may be because of her lack of taste, but she would have the same reaction to capsaicin as anybody else does - so it's her tolerance to capsaicin they're feeding with super spicy sauces, just like everybody else.\n\nI'd also question the ability for anybody to make a sandwich with such a high capsaicin sauce, even if they had no sense of smell, since they would notice that their sinuses were clearing and eyes were watering.",

[Here](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20161020-can-you-hurt-yourself-eating-chilli-peppers) was the first article that popped up on Google. While capsaicin cannot directly cause damage, the body can take extreme measures to fight off the perceived heat, including vomiting and diarrhea.\n\nIf you don\u2019t consider severe pain and vomiting for hours to be \u201cserious damage,\u201d that\u2019s fine. I won\u2019t argue semantics. But it\u2019s still not something I\u2019d want to see inflicted on someone who\u2019s unaware, especially a child. \n\nAlso, just to be clear, capsaicin isn\u2019t the only \u201cspicy\u201d chemical. Resiniferatoxin, for instance, is [1000x hotter](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-019-0766-3). Interestingly, it does have [medicinal value](https://www.wired.com/story/resiniferatoxin/amp); it is so potent that it actually damages pain receptors. It can be an effective analgesic drug, but that can also be dangerous as the article notes.",

It wasn't the best steak, but it was the best I'd ever had at that point. \n\nNow I know what cut to get and how to cook it properly, etc. I'd never ruin a good steak with ketchup, but if I was given a bad steak, I'd choose ketchup over HP. \n\nLuckily I have hot sauce for those situations.

I'm imagining a situation where someone pranks someone else by giving them super spicy food, would they not be liable for anything cause there is no damage?\n\nI understand that there is no cell damage from the capsaicin, but now that you say it triggers temperature detection it makes me wonder, would the body have the same physiological response to the heat in addition to \"pain and move away\" or is it different? For example, heat stroke is a thing so could eating super spicy foods cause a heat stroke? \n\nSurely it can cause sweating but depending on people's pain tolerance could is also cause vagal response/nausea/vomiting as well? also wondering now if it can cause vasodilation in response to \"heat\" and if that can cause the person to faint?",

And it certainly doesn\u2019t damage your taste buds, as the capsaicin doesn\u2019t even interact with them. Spiciness isn\u2019t a taste; it\u2019s simply a pain response.\u201d \n\nSo spice doesn\u2019t actually damage your mouth or throat. It just effects your neurotransmitters and provokes a pain response. \n\n\u201cthere are reports of some people, in a few anecdotal cases, getting injured during extreme chile pepper\u2013eating contests. It seems likely that these injuries mostly come from the shock of the experience, but in at least a couple instances, eating extremely spicy food has been thought to be responsible for spasms in arteries that led to nonfatal heart attacks and a thunderclap headache. At high enough concentrations, capsaicin can harm you by blocking the production of certain neurotransmitters, making it so nerve cells can\u2019t communicate with one another, but your body will prevent you from consuming that much of the chemical by vomiting and otherwise sending you the unavoidable signals that it is rejecting the substance you are putting in your body.\u201d\n\nOh look at that, there are some VERY RARE instances of very intense chili peppers causing health problems. Not chili peppers like jalape\u00f1os or Sorano peppers. Intense ones. Like ghost peppers, Carolina reapers, those peppers that people normally don\u2019t eat casually. And the article even says most of the time it\u2019s not even caused by the actually spice, just from the shock of the heat, aka the PAIN response. So no physical damage to throat or mouth has been mentioned yet. \n\n\u201cif you already have underlying problems such as stomach ulcers, ulcerative colitis, Crohn\u2019s disease, IBS, or Celiac disease, you can experience a temporary worsening of your symptoms. For some susceptible people, breathing in capsaicin could lead to an asthma attack or other respiratory distress.\u201c\n\nOkay, so all of those above mentioned diseases/disorders could have worsening symptoms. Sure I\u2019ll\nGive you that. But still, the final sentence to the article says \n\n\u201cBut in general, while exposure to extreme chiles can be uncomfortable and often painful, they\u2019re not harmful for your health.\u201d\n\nSo there you have it. Gonna link any definitive proof that spice does in fact cause damage to your mouth or throat?",

Oil binds to oil. It might be better than soap. I had my son rub his hands with isopropyl alcohol and that helped. I'm going to try cooking oil next time there's a capsaicin meltdown going on.",

One thing I learned when I started making sandwiches for lunch during the start of pandemic times is to kinda weave my lunchmeat so I get a good amount in each bite. Easiest way to do it is take a slice of lunchmeat, fold it over so it only covers half the sandwich, do the same on both halves. Then do two more slices (of the same or a different meat) perpendicular and kinda weave them. It helps you get some meat in every bite and it helps keep the meat from sliding out of the sandwich.",

There are other spicier sauces out there with much higher capsaicin levels due being pepper extracts rather than a blended sauce made for flavor. One good example is Mad Dog 357 Plutonium No. 9, which is so spicy it literally has a health warning label unlike the Last Dab. With pepper extract sauces though, you're not really meant to consume it directly as you're supposed to mix a few drops in to add a little kick to your dish.",

Kids are like us, they just need to build up a tolerance to these sorts of things.  For example, in India curry is a pretty common dish, so much so that parents prepare it for their little ones in their lunches.  I learned this through the international school I had my son enrolled in for a time.  Little toddlers were running all over the place with the scent of fresh curry on the morning air.  I asked around, and both the caretakers and administrators were happy to share their findings.\n\nThat said, going from no spice exposure to The Last Dab is a pretty huge leap.  Luckily it wasn't Da Bomb...  Yikes.  Maybe next time you start the little one off light with some Sriracha?  Keep 'em spicy, sauce boss!",

If I had only put on a couple drops it probably would have been ok...but I covered the chicken.\n\nPredictably, my son started crying after 5 minutes that it was too hot.  I thought he was just making a mountain out of a molehill until I took a bite...and my eyes started watering.  I got him some milk, waited for it to subside, then took him out to dinner and ice cream.\n\nMy son still reminds me of the \"Hot Sauce Incident\" 20 years later.",

On this particular she picked us up and seemed concerned about something. As we talked about our day with her she kept asking John if he was feeling alright, if his stomach was hurting, if he\u2019d had diarrhea, etc. \n\nEventually John was like ,\u201dwtf mom, why do you keep asking me if I\u2019m okay? I feel fine!\u201d. She paused for a moment\u2026 the quietly said that while cooking his eggs that morning she\u2019d accidentally sprayed the pan with Raid bug poison instead of non-stick spray! They were kept side by side under the stove.\n\nJohn was fine, but holy shit what a big fuck up! She should\u2019ve called the school probably rather than wait all day to see if he fell ill.\n\nAnyway, as parents we all make mistakes. Please don\u2019t be too hard on yourself. I feel a little annoyed with that nurse to be honest, I wonder if you were the child\u2019s mother if she would\u2019ve been as rough with you. Thankfully your daughter is okay, now you have a story ready for your speech at her wedding, and she can tell all her friends she\u2019s eaten a 3 million scoville hot sauce.",

But doesn't normally have something that hot.  But if this is real,  while you deserve to feel bad a little bit for putting your kid through that misery,  don't feel too bad about the nurse and principals scolding.  There is literally zero physical effects the hotsauce could have had.  It could not have been \"so much worse\" and there is no \"dangers\" that it could of caused.  It was literally the worst it could of been.  Capsaicin does no actual physical burning or harm,  it \"tricks\" the body into feeling those sensations,  but there is no physical damage done.  It just attaches itself to the same nerve endings that send that response to your body.  There is no damage done or anything dangerous happening (young or old).  \n\nAlso,  (whole) milk helps a little because it carries a similar protein called casein.  It helps to break down the capsaicin.  But it's also a double edged sword because capsaicin is carried through an oil and drinking anything will spread it to other receptors in your mouth that may have not been originally exposed.  \n\nWith really spicy stuff like that,  the best relief I have found is eating ice cream.  The cold helps numb everything,  the fat and casein helps breaks things down and relieve the pain,  but it only helps while your eating it.  Anything at higher scoville ratings just has to run its course.",

Despite the 3 million Scoville rating it comes off as far less hot than Da Bomb which is the 3rd last sauce on Hot Ones but is the ones that hurts celebs mouths the most.  Now that could do some damage.  A mouthful of that could make you freak out especially if you don't know what's happening. The Last DAb barely gets any reaction from celebs on Hot Ones.

It was basically vinegar, oil, paprika, and habanero hot sauce. \n\nThe drunk adults thought that would be funny so they let him. Little brother starts crying because it's so hot. Adults drunkenly laugh until my dad decides it's enough and tells brother to stop crying and drink some milk. Little brother is a literal toddler so continues crying and doesn't drink the milk because he doesn't understand what's happening. Drunk dad decides to slap him and dump the milk on his head. \n\n\n\nThe point of my story? You're not a bad dad, you just messed up. Poor kid though, she might be scared of hot things forever now!",
