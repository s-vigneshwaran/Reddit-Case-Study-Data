Not to mention that in many ways, one could argue the US is in the middle of a full-on war against women (and other marginalized groups) that's really opened the floodgates recently to an increase in open misogynistic behavior & attitudes. To use your metaphor (well-applied btw, even though I disagree) our own government basically just gave the zebras AR-15s and said \"have at it, fam\". And for another, I typically don't see the same treatment on most other demographics, and you yourself only called it \"nearly equal\". Even if that were true though, I'm not convinced being genuinely horrible to everyone is a solid defense - that's the kind of argument people use to defend fucked up comedians etc. because the logic is twisted into \"you can't be a bigoted shitbag if you're awful to everyone\".

While I'm sure that some of these guys hate women, is it accurate to call it \"misogynistic\" when OP came here asking to be roasted? Could I claim assault if I asked someone to punch me in the face?\n\nWhy defend this one person on this one post? You claim to have been subbed to roastme for years, yet I scrolled through a few months worth of your comments and this is the only post I see you commenting or defending anyone on. Why play white knight now? Did you not care about the plight of women before? Or does OP strike a resemblance to yourself and therefore it hits a little too close to home?\n\nIt's interesting that you are ok with calling out men over the things they say when you're not much better yourself. I came across this when looking at your comments and...yikes. You know if a guy had said something creepy like this then he would have been sandblasted for it.\n\n\"Just a bi girl lurker here, but you're quite attractive (aesthetically but also you seem to have a really great energy) and I hope you feel as good about yourself as you look to us!\"",

To use your metaphor, if you asked to be punched in the face and instead someone took a crowbar to your kneecaps, yeah, that's assault.\n\nAlso, \"all women get treated like shit here so it must be fine\" is a pretty awful defense. Literally I can't even begin to understanding why you thought that would work or be in any way valid, aside from your clear assumption that I'm an idiot.\n\nAs far as why I'm calling out some of the misogyny (not just \"things men say\") on this post, that doesn't matter at all, it's irrelevant to the point, which was never about me. Your straw man nonsense isn't going to work here. The same is true of your tu quoque/attempted misdirection and mischaracterization of an unrelated (and perfectly acceptable) comment of mine.\n\nIf you want to argue your pro-misogyny agenda, do it. Don't lean on a bunch of bullshit fallacies to try and make me seem like the asshole. You chose your hill, so at least have the bravado to (metaphorically, of course) die on it.

If that's really the hill you wanna die on, be my guest. Just keep in mind, you don't actually know me, and also there's no world in which just referring to a woman as \"it\" counts as a roast.\n\nRoasting requires cleverness if not actual comedy, hence it being a challenging and specific genre, and why there are so many writers for people appearing at Comedy Central roasts. Half the point is that not everyone can do it, especially well. You put zero effort into your comment (at least, for your sake I hope you did) and didn't bother trying to make it interesting, original, or funny. Objectively, that's just being insulting to a female stranger. Which is misogynistic.\n\nBut I'm the offensive \"basher\"? I'm guessing your leaps in logic are more amusing than any \"roast\" you've ever made.",

In this scenario should I disrespect you keep calling you Johnathan or should I use the name you gave me when you introduced yourself to me?\n\n\nBeing a woman is a social construct the same way being a man is, or having a name. Female and male are biological definitions of sex. Gender is a social construct, just like a name, and if someone identifies themselves, and if you live in a society you take things upfront as truth before claiming they are telling lies.\n\n \"Your name is not John, it's Johnathan, so I'll call you Johnathan\"\n\nSee how much of an asshole you sound like? It's the same. Defining \"woman\" vs defining \"female\" are two distinct things. If you have a hard time grasping that, then you asked the question about defining a woman without actually wanting an answer, you just want to be able to put forth your definition as the truth for others.\n\n\nThe day you learn there are individual truths is the day you will be mature enough to realize that asking that question, even with your biases, is what undermines a Society of diverse human beings",

Of course a biological male even after transition is still a biological male, that immutable, but in society the beauty is you can be named Josephine, the christian god loving woman, and still be a biological male. It doesn't matter if you keep saying I MUST define gender, you have to define a name? Can you? Can't you just say a name is a societal structure the same way a gender is? Sure I am human, that's a fact, I can go up to someone and state facts \"I am a biological male, human, Caucasian born on XYZ.\" All those are facts about me but in society they do not identify me, or do I identify myself those attributes, \"hi, my name is John, I go by they/them\" was that so hard? Literally a conversation that transcends biology, and if push comes to shove \"I am a man\" done. Would you question my name? \"You look like a Pedro, I'm gonna call you Pedro\" fuck off right?",
