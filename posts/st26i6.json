Everything I read says that makes me an extreme outlier, because false claims are supposedly rare\u2026but it is very hard to discount your own experience.\n\nI hate to break it to you, but the Nazi\u2019s probably really did burn down the Reichstag.

And those who may be sincere Christians, but either disagree with tipping culture or simply don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like to work in the food industry, would fall into the first. \n\nUltimately, Christians are people too, and while we should be more virtuous, we often aren\u2019t.",

These include, but are not limited to:\n\n* Rudeness towards other Redditors,\n* Spreading incorrect information,\n* Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a \\`/s\\`.\n\n## Am I banned from the Reddit?\n\nNo - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.\n\n## I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?\n\nSure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.\n\n## How can I prevent this from happening in the future?\n\nAccept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.",

      "text": "Beware, the proverb \"hell hath no fury like a stripper who realizes she's been given fake money\". I think I read that one in a fortune cookie or something..  \n\n\nBut seriously  When I was 17 and underage, I tagged along with a bunch of guys from work at the grocery store who said they were going \"out for wings\" after we closed the store. I'd also been sweeping and found half a $10 bill. Which was useless without the other half. More on that later.  This was way back when I was YDFC.  \nIt was also during my very brief bible thumping phase in the mid 90's - I was part of a youth group, or a mutual conversion attempt between a girl I liked at the time -who'd gotten me \"saved\".. so when I learned \"out for wings\" meant \"going to the rippers\", I tried to nope out, but got dragged in. I wanted to get kicked out. And figured telling the guys I'd used the \"floor ten\" would encourage them leave early.\n\nSo, out came the half $10 bill. It got folded and rolled up so it looked whole, and up on the flat-top I went. It was the mid 90's so most dudes were up there with $1 or $2. And there I went with $10 (enough for a VIP). The DJ made a huge deal of it \"is that a Fkn' 10??? CINNAMON, LOOK HE HAS A 10!!! hoooolllyyyyy shhhh---\"  \n\n\nShe took the rolled up bill out of my mouth while other guys all piled on the stage on their backs, tips ready,  and my head was beneath her knees, I'm thinking \"welp, I'm going to hell.\" She's like OMG, wow. thanks! And spent a song and a half on me. Meanwhile I was a nervous wreck, like.. yeah.. gonna have to leave right after this because when she finds out....   \nMeanwhile she's got my belt off and is pretending to whip me with it.  \nCome on.. move on to the next guy...   \nShe kissed me on the cheek - \"THANK YOU SO MUCH\"  \nAnd then she  un-rolled the bill.  The HALF A 10 DOLLAR BILL, right above me.  \n\n\nI sat up fast and she pushed me back down, hard. \"WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS????\"  \nShe pushed me down again, knees tight against my head.  \n\n\nThe DJ was like WHAT?  over the speakers.  She waved the useless bill above her head  \nand shouted over her shoulder at the DJ  \"ASSHOLE GAVE ME THIS!!!\"  \nThe DJ turned on me and replied \"oh fuck that guy, HALF a BILL?  Cinnamon, kick his ass!\"  \nAnd then she used my belt for real. She used the buckle. Beat me with it like a rented mule.   \nChipped one of my front teeth with the buckle even.. And then two pairs of burly arms grabbed my shins and dragged me off the stage, my head hit the bar and the stool and the ground, before I got flipped over and picked up by two enormous bouncers who bum-rushed me out the heavy oak front doors, head first. I got heaved out into the gravel parking lot and got told  to never come back.  \nMy co-workers ran out, and the bouncers were like \"you're all  with him?\"   \nAnd they got banned too.\n\nThey were pissed off and like, \"was that the ten you swept up at the store? what were you thinking??\"  And they drove me home.  And it became the go-to story \"this guy here..\" story at the grocery store. Even the managers knew.  We all laugh about it now.  \n\nTLDR - Gave a dancer useless, damaged money. Got my ass kicked on the flat top.",
