He wakes up in the hospital and has no limbs, he is blind, his tongue and teeth were destroyed as were his ears. He tries to suffocate himself but he can't because he has a tube in his throat. \n\nI won't spoil it in case you decide to read it but it's basically my worst nightmare and about twice a week I make myself sick to my stomach thinking about it.",

My comment was pretty clearly about my own son who is normal now, but only because of risky medical procedures and some time where he was on life support including ecmo. He\u2019s not on life support now, he is walking, eating and talking and has full brain function at 21 months old and will live a full life. And the original comment you initially replied to was basically saying parents are ridiculous who want a chance to try risky procedures to save their medically complex children, in the midst of the horrific state of health care pricing. Which is another issue in itself. \n\n\nThere\u2019s a pretty wide spectrum from \u201cneeds medical interference and surgeries as a newborn\u201d to \u201cvegetative state with no brain function forever.\u201d  \n\n\nUltimately i would probably not make the decision to keep life support on if they we brain dead, so in essence I agree with your end point, although I feel a lot of empathy for them as they probably have wishful thinking that their child\u2019s state may change in the future.\n\n\nBUT I\u2019d sure as hell fight for the chance for my kid to have a life before things got to that point. Which is what most of these medical procedures are for. I think vegetative children on life support are not that common, but I haven\u2019t seen stats. There is a spectrum of \u201cquality of life\u201d that is obviously difficult to draw when you\u2019re not the one experiencing it as the parent or even individual (like the kid in the actual OP who made this decision 100% for himself). Sometimes people on Reddit like to act like they are the ones who know all the ethical rights and wrongs of everyone else\u2019s life and decisions, but it\u2019s a bit more complex than that and sometimes peoples comments here border disturbingly on eugenics. \n\n\nTldr- I agree with your bottom line, but you jumped from one scenario I argued (medically complex kids) to a very different one (vegetative kids on life support) when the two do not equate.",

There's definitely a lot of gray areas around the ethics of different situations that could happen with that, but at what point do we let people make the choice to die?\n\nOf course there are a ton of situations where there are solutions that genuinely make someone's life better, and they're happy they stuck around.  But like, say you've already tried those solutions?  Say someone is in such a physical condition that their existence is just... Awful.  And there's no chance of it getting better, their body is not capable of healing to a point where their quality of life could improve.  When do you let them decide to die?  At that point, you're not keeping them alive for their sake.  You're keeping them alive for the people around them, and how is that fair?  \n\nI'm not saying that everyone who wants to die should be able to without intervention or attempts to fix the things that are making them want to die.  But at some point, when options have been exhausted, it's crueller to keep someone alive when they would clearly rather not be.",

It happened to a teenager when he accidentally drove a forklift off a bridge and it landed on top of him. He was conscious during the whole thing and he made the decision himself to follow through on the amputation in the hopes of living. He wanted to keep living, and had he been born during any earlier point in human history, he wouldn't have. \n\nIt might be a foreign concept--to want to continue living even in the face of great adversity. The way I see it, I'm going to have trillions and trillions of years of not existing, so I'd rather spend these few I have to exist alive if I can help it. Have you seen the movie Soul? I feel like even getting the chance to smell a slice of pizza or feel a spring breeze on your face is enough to make life worth living.\n\nLife is undoubtedly going to be hard for him, and he'll probably have to cope with all of the difficulties listed in the post. But he has a girlfriend who stuck by him through it all and family and friends who love him and he was brave enough to accept the challenges ahead rather than simply giving up.\n\nSo the man wanted to live, and because we live in an age of phenomenal medical advancement due to the time and effort of humanity's best and brightest, he was were able to. Had they kept them alive against his will, that's another story. But in this story, he wanted to live and now he still gets to, and I think that's pretty amazing for everyone involved.",

He has not been able to move his limbs or speak for almost 30 years. He communicates by moving his eyes, and also still compose music by communicating all the info to his caretaker (tempo, notes, rhythms... one by one and almost one letter at a time). He's got the same disease Stephen Hawking had, who also did not kill himself.\n\nHe could easily get help offing himself (like Terry Pratchett did, before Alzheimer completely fried his brain off) and no-one would bat an eye as his disease could kill him at any instant. \n\nMarcel Proust lived for 15 years locked up in a cold room because of his poor health, still didn't kill himself.\n\nWe know of these people because they are famous, but many anonymous people live the same way. Some people just enjoy living and don't want to die, even if they're unable to move a single limb. Some are even happy.",

If all else fails and someone is suffering every waking moment, doctors should have the power to use their skills to give a patient a painless death as a final act of service to public health.\n\n\"Preserving life\" is completely different from \"keeping a corpse breathing,\" and you would preserve the quality, memory, and image of life through euthanasia in terminally-suffering patients. \n\nYou know they couldn't even kill Terry Schiavo when they realized it was inhumane? They weren't allowed to, so all they could do was stop further treatment. She starved to death for 11 days",

I don't expect you to be able to wrap your head around the concept, but people should be allowed to make their own choices, regardless of how it makes other people feel. If this guy wants to live this way, more power to him, but the fact is that society puts a lot of pressure on people to hold on to a life that that same society will make little to no room for. I'm not going to sit here and outline the challenges ahead for a person in this young man's position, but it should be enough to say that this surgery is not the end of a very difficult road for him, and the only person giving him any input should be someone who actually understands all that.",
