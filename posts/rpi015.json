It's hard to gauge how many Subaru drivers or Whiskey drinkers there are, but we can find good numbers for geographies:\n\n|Subreddit|Subscribers|Population|Representation|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|/r/minnesota|211,180|5,706,398|3.70%|\n|/r/Scotland|193,920|5,466,000|3.55%|\n|/r/Oregon|137,205|4,289,439|3.20%|\n|/r/Nevada|44,241|3,104,614|1.43%|\n|/r/Texas|393,992|29,527,941|1.33%|\n|/r/Georgia|130,027|10,799,566|1.20%|\n|/r/California|350,260|39,237,836|0.89%|\n|/r/Florida|181,959|21,538,187|0.84%|\n\nWe see that a subreddit represents 0.84% - 3.7% of a groups population.\n\nUsing these representation figures means that the 218,193 /r/FemaleDatingStrategy members represent 5.9M (3.7%) to 25.8M (0.84%) of these individuals in the real world. Assuming half of these are in the US then we have 3M - 13M *\"Queens\"*.\n\nNext there are 108,133,727 females over the age of 18 in the US ([source](https://www.infoplease.com/us/census/demographic-statistics)).\n\nSo, there is a 1-in-36 to 1-in-8 chance that a dating age woman in the US would subscribe to a /r/FemaleDatingStrategy mindset. I'd also posture that these women are less likely to maintain a long term relationship and are more likely to be single, meaning the chance of encountering one of these ladies when dating may be up to 1-in-5.",

It seems more to come from an exaggerated idea of what dating should be like for them. \n\nI'm a cis guy so I'm not talking from lived experience, but women have a lot of societal conditioning that their worth only comes from their attractiveness. It's not a good thing and I can completely understand and empathize why the insecurities from that conditioning would lead to a mindset like FDS. \n\nThat being said, they are still adults who are responsible for their actions and deserve to be called out appropriately as entitled and narcicisstic.",

It\u2019s a way of deluding themselves that remaining alone is a result of their unwillingness to accept anything other than \u201chigh value\u201d men - an easier pill to swallow than making a genuine attempt to find a partner and failing",

Also, this is an average (although the HDI corrects for privilege) which means that an individual or specific community's life may have gone to shit in 10 years. Just because \"we\" are doing better, it doesn't mean life can't suck for some people. Also contentment is relative in basically every dimension.",

Nobody wants to help you, because you should \"man up\", you're forcefully kicked out of home (or the environment becomes super hostile, which is the same) or you're kept at home to be a pet for your mother.

Or homelessness - homelessness has been fun for eons for any man!\n\nThe problems of single men are not a new-age phenomenon. It's not some sort of \"woke curse\" or whatever the red pillers want you to believe. It's just in the nature of mankind to have a life of suffering and toil, and to somehow find hope and happiness despite it. (And I do mean humankind as a whole.)",

And sooooo much organization. I even vacuumed the rug and played with the dogs on it just so I could vacuum it again. And now I know I would go absolutely insane being a housewife. Being a housewife with a househusband and neither of us has to work and can always do things together? THAT would be perfect. Living life work free isn't fun if you're living it alone for 40 hours a week. Not for me at least.",

Perhaps demand isn't the best word to use (but I used it in my other comments because, well, it was implied) but you are saying that if you work and your wife doesn't, it's not unreasonable for you to expect sex on demand and that you'd be happy to do that, so you cannot understand why anyone else wouldn't be happy to do the same.\n\nThe expectation of sex on demand is just a small step away from demanding sex outright. if you see why the latter is wrong then it shouldn't be much of a leap to see why the former is problematic as well.\n\nas far as you'd be happy to oblige your partner, then so what? As I said in another comment, it's not about what you'd be happy doing, it's about what your partner would be happy doing. Find a partner that would be happy giving you sex anytime you want it, great for y'all. But expecting that of your partner at the times that she doesn't want to give it up, for whatever reason, maybe she has a headache, or she's tired, or she want's to watch a TV show instead, or she just has other things to do right now and doesn't have an hour to make you cum. It doesn't matter. it's not your place to expect that of her just as it's not her place to expect something similar of you.",

I clean the house, I do the laundry, I wash the dishes, I fix the car, I sweep mop clean and take care of the cat. And I go to work 10 hours a day 6 days a week and I exercise so I can actually have the energy to maintain this and when I\u2019m in a relationship I participate in sexual intimacy with my partner.   \n\nI didn\u2019t imply shit. The only thing I said was I don\u2019t get it because that would currently be a *reduction* in my daily responsibilities.   \n\nAnd I\u2019m speaking ***solely*** from my perspective as a house husband. All of you guys keep turning this shit into my dream stay at home wife. I don\u2019t make enough money to support someone at home fuck that noise all day. You are getting your ass a job.",

You took something I said, applied it wrongly to yourself and then created an argument out of it.  \n\nThat is this entire comment chain. Because I said   \n\n>I\u2019d happily give someone oral sex every day with zero reciprocation if it meant not having to work.  \n\nThat means according to these people on reddit, that I ***EXPECT*** this from women. I never mentioned a woman. I never said shit about women. This  is **my** house husband fantasy, women are not allowed into it. Yet you guys just inserted women into it and made them the victim out of nowhere.   \n\nLiterally had a woman insist that I want a prostitute to treat as a sex object instead of being involved in a relationship. *Because I said I'd give oral sex to a woman*.  \n\n\n I don't even know what's happening anymore. Its like I'm not allowed to have opinions as to how I would act without it being construed as an attack on women.

I'd never expect a cooked meal on the table, or certain tasks to be done every day. I expect her to do her best for any given day, mental health as a priority.\n\nMost days she's bang on the mark, but other days she has a shit time and some things get missed. That's totally okay, and there should be no issue with that happening. I hope she never feels obligated to do anything if its to her detriment.",

What was she doing? \n\nI think arrangements where there is an agreement that the woman will be taken care of and she won't have to do anything is a sugar baby situation.

But you completely skipped over my second sentence and then went and applied my disagreement selectively to your conversation.  \n\nEven if the **wife** was the one who suggested she would be a stay at home wife and do the cooking and cleaning, if the husband said that his wife stays home and cooks and cleans he would 100% be labeled as a misogynist.

                      "text": "I was out of work for several years (with two part-time jobs in between) after my first child is born and then again after the second. We lived in a country with no labor laws and I lost my job after having my first. They replaced me with a man. You're in no danger of any childbirth happening with a man. Then I couldn't find another job in my field because employers had policies of not hiring women (like I said, no labor laws.)\n\nAnyway, my husband supported me and the kids until we came to the US and I found work, and I'm here to report that it's not as great as it sounds. He did nothing around the house and avoided the kids, because he said he was already bringing home the money, and my job was to do everything else. It was hard taking care of a baby and a toddler on my own. The oldest was on the autism spectrum (which we didn't know at the time) and didn't like being around the baby, but we only had one room and there was nowhere else for him to be. Meanwhile my husband would be watching TV and yelling at me for hot dinner not being on the table on time. Oh and you better believe that I was yelled at for how I spent his money, too. I admit what made it more infuriating in our case was that, when I did have a job, I liked it, was good at it, outearned him, and had helped him find his own first programming job through my network.\n\nThen we came to the US and I found a job six months before he did. Guess what, he continued to do nothing around the house and with the kids, and to yell at me for no hot dinner on time. I guess he was used to this life by now and couldn't change? The one time I left him to watch the kids for 15 minutes while I went to the laundry room on our floor, both kids got out, not just of our apartment, but out of the entire building, someone found them in the parking lot and brought them back, and my husband hadn't even noticed that they were gone, until I came back with the laundry and asked him where the kids were. Again, that was during the time when I supported him financially. Didn't matter anymore. He'd already gotten used to not being responsible for a damn thing at home.\n\nMy kids are now adults, I'm no longer married to that man (best decision of my life), and I still have a vivid memory of when he sat me down 25 years ago to patiently explain to me that every single thing around the house and with the kids was my job, because I wasn't making any money. I made sure to never again be financially dependent on him. IMO, money is power, being a breadwinner can go to a man's head because let's be honest, in a breadwinner role, he will be in full control of the family finances, and that might give him ideas that he's in full control of his spouse too. My ex was a nice guy and I'd never seen that coming. You don't know how someone will react to a situation until they're in it. Never taking that risk again.",

But now I am in my 30's and all my peers are constantly stressed out and never have time to do random fun stuff. Meanwhile my husband and I sleep in till midday in the weekend and spend the day watching movies together while munching a fresh baked apple pie I made the day before.  \nAnd sure, if I was able to work as well we would have more money, but chances are we would just spend that money on a cleaner and take out food so we can be as free and chill as we are now.",

Figuring how to get that garden growing from March to January in northeast Ohio was even harder. \nMowing, haircuts for kid and dogs, cat is sick,  treadmill chores like dishes and laundry take up soooo much time even with just 3 people!\nUnexpected things like teaching the kid numbers or how to read can be extremely taxing if you haven't realized yet how you are responsible for teaching them every thing! \nGood stay at home parents who have successful homes and children who are professionals in life definitely deserve more credit!",

They also point out that women tend to be their husband\u2019s only friend and practically his therapist and that married men live longer lives due, it is assumed, to their wives and the contributions they bring.  They also believe that when getting involved with a man they are taking on a risk, as a majority of domestic abuse cases and deaths are male-on-female violence.\n\nFew women if any on FDS are like the woman in the video above, claiming they\u2019ll just stay at home and do nothing once they\u2019re married, lol.

Unfortunately I disagree with you in many points. \n\n\"Knowing your worth\" and  \"treating a man as you treat him\".  No, FDS thinks they are godlike and every man born to serve them. Paying a date isn't a big issue, I can pay 10 dates a day and it wouldn't even make a dent in my bank account but I don't understand what makes you think any of the FDS deserves that. \n\n\"Risking health with pregnancy\". In my opinion living with an FDS is a bigger health hazard because they'll be happy to make a man to work to death so that man can pay for their luxury. And I'm sure FDS would be happy after that because they'd get a life insurance money. \n\n\"Domestic abuse\". I don't deny the domestic abuse millions of women deals with every day and I am sorry for that, however FDS are domestic abusers if you look at them without your FDS hat on. \n\n\"Being a therapist\" and \"man living longer if married\". Do you have any data supporting being married with an FDS gives the same result? \n\nI'm not just a teenager complaining about relationships, I'm around 40 and married for 11 years. In my opinion FDS is a form of sexism, therefore sadly I have to wish you the worst of luck in your \"dating strategy\", I hope no FDS member ever be successful. Also I hope any men who abuses, mistreats, hurts women shares the same fate.",

If all those things occurred, generally speaking, then sure, it might be mainstream then. \n\nBut if the only way to find FDS views is to seek out specific types of people, then no, that shit isn't mainstream. It's niche.\n\nMost people can recognize how toxic and shitty FDS views are. Most people disagree with FDS views. It is not, in any sense, mainstream.\n\nJust like how Reddit is not 'mainstream' either... It does not represent society in general.",

Laundry, cooking, cleaning, grocery shopping. Let alone when kids or pets are in the picture. \n\nThat work doesn\u2019t go away whether you live alone or both people work. There\u2019s value in one partner not working so that those things are taken care of and allow them spend more time together. \n\nGender doesn\u2019t matter, the end result does. I don\u2019t care about having a hot meal when I get home. I have a slow cooker that can do that. What I do care about is that when I am done with work, I can spend my free time with the person I love instead of one/both of us running errands or doing chores. \n\nQuick preemptive rebuke: Yes the \u2018at home\u2019 partner can get a part time job.

(He literally told me to marry a rich old guy, divorce him and take all his money then marry the young hot guy I really want) BUT my standards were sort of forever changed lol.

Still realize I need to have my own money and savings and everything but I let him provide for me and we\u2019re both happy :) enjoy the little scope into a strangers life I suppose lol.

There\u2019s this now infamous clip of women being asked on the street if a man can say no to sex, and they all said they can\u2019t say no, some of them saying that if they do they\u2019ll assume they\u2019re gay. Us men are viewed as piggy banks and sex machines. We\u2019re expected to always pay for the meal on a date, we\u2019re always expected to make the first move even if we\u2019re the most awkward people on the planet, and we\u2019re expected to always know everything there is to know about sex even if we\u2019re virgins. We\u2019re expected to be perfect. We\u2019re still living in age-old gender roles and no one cares because it benefits women. When a man cheats, he\u2019s the worst person imaginable but when a woman cheats, it\u2019s the man\u2019s fault because he \u2018didn\u2019t give her what she needed.\u2019 We live in a world of assumptions and in a world where communication isn\u2019t that prevalent. Women can say all these unrealistic things about what they want in a man but the moment a man says that they want a woman to be fit, to be at a healthy weight, even if it\u2019s only pertaining to health, they\u2019re the scum of the fucking earth. There are moments where I hate being a man in this society because we\u2019re left in the dust. It\u2019s no wonder men are statistically more likely to commit suicide than women, because our issues are not important to the world. Whether it\u2019s mental or physical issues, they are pushed to the wayside in comparison to women\u2019s. In all of these advertisements and commercials for therapists and such you mostly see women. We are far behind and in this modern world where we are more isolated than we\u2019ve ever been, it\u2019s not a whole lot better.",

She makes it abundantly clear that she sees no value in anyone aside from what they can give her and do for her. \n\nEven if her aversion to work were an actual inability to work stemming from a disability, that doesn\u2019t speak to her unwillingness to put forth effort in other ways. I mean seriously\u2014she\u2019s not even going to bother with birthdays? \n\nA relationship is a partnership, but she doesn\u2019t want to be a partner. She wants someone else to provide for her materially and emotionally without requiring anything of her\u2014she wants to be an adult dependent in every sense of the word. And, *in this context*, that\u2019s useless.",

She worked when she met her first husband, stayed together for eight years and she was still working this time they both worked at the Pentagon. My sister cheated on her husband more times than I realized until he told me recently. They moved to New Orleans where her husband got stationed at the Navy base, had a house built they never lived in because my sister cheated on him again and this time it was with the husband she's been with for well over 18 years. As soon as they got married my sister stopped working. She never tried to find a job because she felt she didn't need to since her husband provided for her. This went on for many years until they had to file bankruptcy and their ginormous house went into foreclosure. All because of my sister's greed.\n\nMy sister was spoiled all throughout her life by my mother and the only reason my sister worked was to pay for her vehicle and buy herself things. I don't think she ever helped our mom pay bills. \n\nI know that if my sister's husband dies before she does (he's 15 years older than she is), my sister will try to find another man to take care of her. She is now 57 and although I haven't seen her since 2009 I'm sure she isn't the trophy wife she once was. She has screwed so many men I'm sure having sex with her is like throwing a hot dog down a hallway.",

The less-than-leech in the video is just outwardly manipulative and abusive towards men. \n\n>This kind of entitlement is caused by a *society* that believes women aren\u2019t important enough to have a job that brings you satisfaction other than being a mother housekeeper for your husband\n\nMore women are in college than men. Women pursue majors that tend to pay less than men even when constantly encouraged to enter the STEM field and given scholarships (just for being female) in these majors in TODAY\u2019S society. Unless you are living in another society, women are free to pursue whichever major they so choose. This isn\u2019t the 1950\u2019s. Women can literally do whatever the fuck they want with their lives (as we all should) AND receive more assistance in pursuing male dominated, higher paying, fields.\n\nWhat exactly is the \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d doing to prevent women from being more than a mom and housewife? And if this is toxic masculinity, then what exactly would be toxic misandry? Would it be roles between men and women completely flipped? Or would it be women seeking to stay at home and do nothing as the women in the video is wanting? I\u2019m curious. \n\nI\u2019m not denying there *are* issues between men and women that require mending.\n\nMen by far have the largest suicide rate and much higher numbers of dying on the job. But let me guess, \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d? In essence it is reasonable to say that here because those are just two examples of how this society is *toxic* to masculine *men*. So how about we just call it a shit society that needs work.\n\nEdit: *coming from a man who (happily) pursued a field predominantly dominated by women",

I'm not going to fall for a guy who takes me on a cookie cutter low effort date that he put no thought into whatsoever. If he suggests going on a walk or grabbing a coffee I might as well do that by myself. Where's the experience, where's the effort? Why would I leave my comfort zone for that?\n\nThe woman in this post is someone who would quickly be told to read some additional resources on FDS and come back after.\n\nFDS is not about ridiculing men and putting them down, it's about knowing your own worth and not settling for less. It encourages women to find out what they want in a partner and to not lower those standards. I make a good living, have a nice home, supportive friends and fulfilling hobbies. A man does not add anything to my life by treating me to a $2 coffee and taking me on a walk, so why would I go out with him? I'm happy and comfortable on my own and if a man wants into my life he has to make it better than it already is.\n\nI believe the men hating on FDS have no clue what the dating world is like as a woman. How is it bad to tell women that they should make their own life perfect first and then look for a partner who adds value to an already fulfilling life?\n\nNot to mention that the women there are not involuntarily celibate, which is the actual term being shortened to incel. but instead they are voluntarily celibate. They choose not to sleep with men they don't see as worthy.",

She'd absolutely tell you that is a toxic place to spend time.\n\n>demeaning? I don\u2019t openly go around telling people they have no value to me because I\u2019m not an asshole lol.\n\nYeah, you're still demeaning people. You don't have to tell people they have no value to be very obvious that you think of them as trash 'low value'. Judging by your supporting of FDS, you probably talk down to retail workers and shit, but don't even realize you're doing it.\n\n>FemaleLevelUp has a strict rules about posting about dating. It\u2019s literally a female advice sub that deals with everything else. \n\nCreated and modded by the same people from FDS. Not so hard to see the way it'll eventually go. FDS probably didn't start as a shithole either.\n\n>You really seem to have a problem when women set standards and advocate for them. That\u2019s a YOU problem.\n\nAbsolutely not. I love empowering people. But I also won't hesitate to point out people that are shitheads and treat people like trash.\n\nThe irony here is you obviously have a serious drinking problem (and I'm glad you're working on it, regardless of this disagreement.) But if your husband subscribed to your FDS mentality, you'd be the low value woman that he would have dumped years ago. \n\nMaybe that paragraph will wake you up from the brainwashing that sub is doing.",

As I said before too, there are exceptions all around. It's just biological, males of a species are going to try and procreate as frequently as possible, while females have to be more selective because of gestation length. Social activities follow some semblance of inherent instinct and behavior that matches it.\n\nIn courting, women hold most of the power, they're far more likely to be making the final decision. This sets men up to be competitive, to run the gambit for their affection. Whether it works, or is right, is a separate notion. It's a game we all play regardless, some just have better experiences with it than others. \n\nPlenty more men out there willing to be a provider for little return than there are women willing to do just the same. And it's in women's best interest, regardless of social stigma, to hedge her bets for the best outcome since men come to her, and rarely the other way. I mean, just look at places like tinder.",

I've laughed a lot and he's also part of the reasons why I got a diagnosis of neurodivergence, he shared his own life experiences and diagnosis process and I saw myself in that. I'd say a streamer can be so much better than this dead weight... On top of that, you gift a streamer out of your own heart when and how much you want, not every single day to support their leisurely life until you die.",

He met a girl online through Xbox live who lives 1200 miles away. She has an actual boyfriend. She cucked this kid I knew as hard as possible. Made him give her 1 solid grand for a mobile game. A MOBILE GAME. Then, when I told him how dumb he's being she told him if he talks to me, she won't talk to him. We knew each other for 15+ years. End of the day, this kid ruined his entire life for a girl who has a boyfriend that isn't him. He had a relationship with a girl, she left him since he wouldn't stop talking to this girl 1200 miles away. So now, he's all alone living in a shit hole house infested with black mold, giving this girl 1200 miles away with an actual boyfriend all of his money. Last I heard he's not allowed to do anything unless she says so. This includes when he's allowed to go to sleep and what she wants him to eat. Crazy but true.",

He got on that train and went anyway.\n\nFast forward she trapped him pretty good, forced him to move out of state or never see his kid again. Haven't seen him since as she also told him if he spoke to me she would also never let him see his son again.\n\nSomething must have happened because last year he came back and wanted to hang out, let me know before he came over she was gonna come too and I canceled on the spot.\n\nLearned later from his mother they were looking for money and a place to stay. She wouldn't even let him get his drivers license. Nor a decent paying job, he has to work at her Burger King where she is a manager so she can \"keep her eye on him\"\n\nShe has a car to go back and forth but he must either walk or bus it.",

Everyone that he was forced to block showed up at his house to sit him down. He refused to let us in. He refused to talk to us. After 3 hours of pleading we left. It's all we could do. After that no one he's known in real life has been in contact with him. Anyone who tries to he gives immature responses to. Such as \"Pull a cock\" and \"I'll beat your ass scum\" then he blocks everyone that tries to talk to him. He even changes his number. He's a complete lost cause. It's comical in a way cause he's 5 foot 3 and is so out of shape he isn't winning any fights.",

He throw everything away for this girl who has an actual boyfriend and is literally just sucking him dry for money. And it's not like he doesnt knows this stuff. He does. He's just in denial. His ex got married and he immediately blamed her for leaving him....even though she left cause he was spending literal hours talking to this other girl who lives 1200 miles away. Like what?

I think she convinced him that they're together and he truly believed it for 10+ years, she even said she had two kids (youngest was like 8) and he'd send money for them too, his entire paycheck basically. \n\n\nEveryone, every single person around him told him it was a scam, he wouldn't believe it. His friend in a last, desperate attempt, bought him a plane ticket and booked him a stay to go meet her (she was halfway across the globe, Australia if I'm not mistaken) and even the airport crew told him nobody with that name existed and he still wouldn't believe them. She ended up finding an excuse and he never doubted her lies. It was so disheartening to see, such a good and kind man completely entranced by a cheap illusion. I think he ended up going home and kept paying her all the same. It's really sad but I assume in his limited world, \"being with her\" somewhat brings him happiness. Or at least that's what I tell myself, to try and find a silver lining in such a miserable situation. He deserves so much better.",

He later said she explained to him that she is \"shy\" which is why she didn't show up. She uses sex toys on camera, she isn't shy!?!? \n\nHe is not a great person either and was kind of a dick to his gf in high school (goes on a rant about his HS gf screwed him over for life because she never had sex with him while she was 3 years younger than him and we also lived in a very religious area. Dude, you're 35. Get over it.). He walks around quoting Thomas Aquinas constantly and acts very holier than though but has probably thrown over 30k away on this Romanian girl.",

If your take is that all women are secret psychopaths like the one in the video (that's what you said) based on observations from people you know...well, that's called personal experience if you really do know these people.  Like I said, it sucks.\n\nPeople are responding to this:\n\n>My comment is about personal experience so you can't just change it to be what you want it to say.\n\nAnd this (before you gracefully edited in \"some other women\" instead of \"all women\"):\n\n>The only difference between her and all other women is that she's honest about it LOL\n\nListen, just logically speaking, if women thought the same way as the one in the video did, humanity wouldn't have survived for this long.  Even in a hypothetical situation where every woman had ideological uselessness like the video girl, what would be the solution?  A rhetorical question, I know.\n\nI was going to suggest that you edit your biggest comment to clear up the confusion, but you did that already. So, I get the point now. Cheers.",

This sub is about optimizing the female dating experience. We don't want to hear \"both sides\" because that tends to end up in only favoring the male perspective.\n\nKind of odd how they feel like \"both sides\" of any relationship problem favors men. At first glance this rule doesn't seem that toxic until you pair it with rule #3.\n\nRule #3 All advice should focus on maximum female benefit. All comments and posts should be focused on how the woman can derive maximum benefit for herself and herself only. Mutual benefit should be a byproduct not a goal.\n\nThey view all relationships with men as purely transactional where they believe women should extract as much monetary/physical/emotional benefits possible with no regard for their partners feelings or happiness. They think all men are trash and even if you find a \"high value male\" his value is only in what he can give you. Again a total disregard for your partners feelings or well being.\n\nRule #5 No \"standard shaming\" Don\u2019t Shame Other Members for having higher standards than you. If someone says they only date men with six figure income we don\u2019t want to hear all about how your first date with your boyfriend was in his mom\u2019s basement sharing a microwaved Hot Pocket. You\u2019re not going to get a cookie or high fives from us because you choose to settle for scraps, sis. Women with desperate pick me behavior will be banned on sight.\n\nKeep going down the list and you start to see the bigger picture. They are teaching women that men's value is directly tied to how much money they have and what they can provide. Men are tools to be used. \n\nNot a rule but part of their \"ideology\" is \"Generous men are non-negotiable. While we believe in having your own career and making your own money, a man still has to add financial value to your life and make you feel like he can take care of you. This means not splitting the bill and not dating financially challenged men.\n\nThis is shit dating advice. Refusing to ever split the bill or pay for dates just makes men feel like an ATM. It's just another example of them teaching women that a relationship is never supposed to be equal. Everything should be in favor of the woman at the expense of the man's financial and emotional well being.\n\nI could keep going but this is barely scratching the surface of the underlying toxicity that the sub teaches. They act like they are strong independent women who only deserve the highest value of men. But they are really more like the women in this video. Entitled and only want to be taken care of while providing nothing in return.",

It's not positive and it distorts relationships.\n\nI always found it fucked that for example if a fight breaks out, a cultural norm is *he* has to sleep on the couch.\n\nLook, if he's cheating or very blatantly in the wrong, fine. If you two fought over something where it's just conflicting opinions, grow up. If you really can't bear sharing a bed with him that night, you need to be the one to sleep on the couch.\n\nIronically, I feel like a lot of the new wave feminism points are simultaneously correct and incorrect; the sentiment is correct, but the fashion in which they're voiced or the exact individuals voicing them is often very skewed. I feel like we have this irony where some of the most frequent people complaining about inequality are the *exact* women who want special treatment. However, they're still correct there's inequality, but I feel the true inequality is that they're not raised with the personal responsibility men are. Not all women of course, but the select ones such as the woman in this video clearly weren't. If those same women were raised with an attitude of needing to provide for themselves as well (as sadly, many parents still present \"marry a rich husband\" as a viable future goal), then this better equips them to fend for themselves, in which case BOTH sides benefit from it because we avoid distorted relationships, as you put it.\n\nLet's imagine the woman in this video, in 10 years, still hasn't found \"the one,\" her body is aging poorly, and she realizes she's in trouble. I can 100% picture her out on the street screaming about inequality. Why? Because she was probably raised with the attitude of \"marry a rich husband\" and it didn't work out. She now lacks the tools to cope with life otherwise. It could have all been avoided if everyone was raised with an attitude of being responsible for themselves and both genders benefit for it. The real \"oppression\" or inequality here, imo, was poor parenting that came about because the parents viewed her gender as less capable or having less demand to be responsible and accountable.",

That's the biggest lie feminism ever told.\n\nHaving a wife who doesn't work seems like a nice luxury. The idea is that she doesn't get fat off those elevated cortisol levels, stressed, irritable, bags under her eyes, perpetually behind on errands, no energy left for you, can't even decide on a place to eat anymore, doesn't pursue any interest outside of netflix and social media, serves any potential children microwave food and outsources the raising of them to low wage workers, etc.\n\nYes I know it doesn't mean it always works out like that, but I don't think there's any reason to believe the divorce rates are any higher for them than couples where both partners are wage slaves.",

So while I expect the problems to be at their worst in the USA due to things like university costs and healthcare, it's clearly not exclusive to the USA.",

These women TRULY BELIEVE men should be rated on a scale of 1-10 based on what he brings to the table(serious rating, not the dating scene type of 10 hawt 6 meh sorta thing) and actually live their lives this way. Many of the sub members claim they never give a shit about anyone that doesn't do all the things a COUPLE should do. Literally what the woman in the video says.\n\nIdk about y'all but FDS' members are a lot weirder than incels talking shit about women just because they couldn't get laid.",

But there's a few post titles which make sense for anyone tbh - \"If you found yourself starting to NAG your man - LEAVE.\"   Yeah, angry dysfunctional relationships where you're always nagging at each other - nix that.\n\n\"Being alone is always > than being with a person of low value\". Not seeing an issue with that, everyone should embrace that.\n\nA few things about age-gaps - which yeah, those can be problems.\n\nA few stories about abuse, stalking, betrayal.  A social media post I'm just not even going to open.\nI mean.. meh.    Why are you scared over this shit? It's not violent, it's not aggressive, it's not pervasive across reddit or in society.

But \n\nBlaming social media for people\u2019s shitty behavior doesn\u2019t help in holding the actual dickheads accountable imo. The medium is only as good or bad as the people in it.",

I have no issue with a women wanting to be a housewife cause it\u2019s a respectable thing to look after the house/the children ( and it\u2019s a hard thing). However you can\u2019t be a housewife and not do anything around the house cause that legit goes against what a house wife is. The reason relationships work is because they are give and take not take take take ( that\u2019s a parasitic relationship ). So it doesn\u2019t matter if you are a housewife or a househusband if you take that role and your SO takes the provider role than I expect that you will do stuff around the house.\nLike even if she finds a dude to provide for her does she really think it\u2019ll last? She\u2019s no super model and even if she was she wouldn\u2019t look like one anymore  after 5-10 years. So she\u2019ll get what maybe a few years of having that provider until she then gets tossed aside for a new possibility younger or more attractive girl? I just don\u2019t logically understand this thought process.",

Her idea of a rainy day investment is *piles of jewelry*, always assessed at a fraction of their purchase price (she treats the pawn shop like a bank). Whenever we try to help her figure things out she has no patience for it and gives up immediately, and either tries to get us to do it for her for free or next to it or throws *far* too much of her rapidly dwindling money at someone unscrupulous.\n\nI have heard other people talk about wanting a sugar daddy or something like that, being spoiled or bougie or what have you.

They never stop to think that if a man can afford the kind of life they\u2019re looking for what is the benefit of marrying a woman like this whose only value is between her legs and, when she decides to file for divorce (80% of divorces are filed by women) she can take half of his wealth and a percentage of his future earnings.

I married someone that prided herself as been modern and all that, back when we were dating saying how important it was to have someone that respected her accomplishments and liberties. Took time off work and had near full responsibilities when she went back to school for her masters degree at some point. Now over the years I\u2019ve seen her do this 180\u00b0 and bemoan she has to go to work and I\u2019m \u201cnot really is provider because I have to work\u201d.  I highly suspect all or nearly all those married to working women hear that on a recurring basis. It\u2019s one of those double standard biases they maintain alive and share with other women regularly. The patriarchy and making girls only fo \u201cgirl things/clothes/career paths? Same, at least for my own experience with my friends\u2019 families and my own extended family, it is in fact women that perpetuate a lot of gender specific things, from \u201cacceptable\u201d colors kids of any gender can wear to leisure activities and everything in between. If not the wife then the auntie/grandma/godmother etc., even in feminist households (most of my friends are in radical or progressive activist circles. Fuck MRA types but yeah, 11 years into this marriage thing I can say with certainty that dads have to face way too many double gender standards in society one way or another.",

Here are two reasons why:\n\n1) Women enroll in higher education more than men. \n\n2) She has to sustain her life up until she manages to find a sucker who will entertain her desired lifestyle somehow. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t \u201cnever want to work,\u201d she plans to stop as soon as she finds a man capable of providing for her to that degree. Unless she gets a BIG allowance from her parents, she clearly has to put money in the bank somehow. \n\nPlenty of educated women end up moving nudes and doing all sorts of shit on Only Fans. She just expects that a man should bear her burden, and his, and be happy that she graces his existence with her presence. \n\nAlso, it still has nothing to do with education. The guys above me are trying to say that the education system is supposed to teach people/women like her that this luxurious housewife ideal is unacceptable.\n\nHer entitled fantasy cannot be taught. It\u2019s a mixture of social media poisoning and her generally entitled personality. She can dream though. If she manages to get it, well done I suppose.",

      "text": "\"**You are a depreciating asset**\", an article/response, is a great summary for anyone with a similar mindset. Bit of a read but well worth it. \n\nSo apparently this was posted by a self proclaimed \"*beautiful (spectacularly beautiful) 25 year old girl*\u201d with the following - \n\n*\u201cI\u2019m looking to get married to a guy who makes at least half a million a year. I know how that sounds, but keep in mind that a million a year is middle class in New York City, so I don\u2019t think I\u2019m overreaching at all\u2026 I am looking for MARRIAGE ONLY\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t be searching for these kind of guys if I wasn\u2019t able to match them \u2013 in looks, culture, sophistication, and keeping a nice home and hearth. What am I doing wrong?\u201d*\n\n**To which a businessman replied**\n\n*\"I read your posting with great interest and have thought meaningfully about your dilemma. I offer the following analysis of your predicament. Firstly, I\u2019m not wasting your time, I qualify as a guy who fits your bill; that is I make more than $500K per year. That said here\u2019s how I see it.*\r  \n\r  \n*Your offer, from the prospective of a guy like me, is plain and simple a cr@ppy business deal. Here\u2019s why. Cutting through all the B.S., what you suggest is a simple trade: you bring your looks to the party and I bring my money. Fine, simple. But here\u2019s the rub, your looks will fade and my money will likely continue into perpetuity \u2026 in fact, it is very likely that my income increases but it is an absolute certainty that you won\u2019t be getting any more beautiful!*\r  \n\r  \n*So, in economic terms you are a depreciating asset and I am an earning asset. Not only are you a depreciating asset, your depreciation accelerates! Let me explain, you\u2019re 25 now and will likely stay pretty hot for the next 5 years, but less so each year. Then the fade begins in earnest. By 35 stick a fork in you!*\r  \n\r  \n*So in Wall Street terms, we would call you a trading position, not a buy and hold \u2026 hence the rub \u2026 marriage. It doesn\u2019t make good business sense to \u201cbuy you\u201d (which is what you\u2019re asking) so I\u2019d rather lease. In case you think I\u2019m being cruel, I would say the following. If my money were to go away, so would you, so when your beauty fades I need an out. It\u2019s as simple as that. So a deal that makes sense is dating, not marriage.*\r  \n\r  \n*Separately, I was taught early in my career about efficient markets. So, I wonder why a girl as \u201carticulate, classy and spectacularly beautiful\u201d as you has been unable to find your sugar daddy. I find it hard to believe that if you are as gorgeous as you say you are that the $500K hasn\u2019t found you, if not only for a tryout.*\r  \n\r  \n*By the way, you could always find a way to make your own money and then we wouldn\u2019t need to have this difficult conversation.*\r  \n\r  \n*With all that said, I must say you\u2019re going about it the right way. Classic \u201cpump and dump.\u201d*",

So I see two pairs that match up with no problem yet for some reason it\u2019s always the women who want to get bought out talking to the men who don\u2019t wanna buy them out and the men who wanna buy a woman out talking to the women who don\u2019t want to be bought out. If we would just stop that there would  be no issue. Just don\u2019t talk to people who aren\u2019t on the same page as you and also don\u2019t talk shit about them either.  Just leave what\u2019s not for you alone so you can focus on what\u2019s for you. Everybody wants to tell somebody else how wrong they are about how they want to live instead of just focusing on what it is you want to do. Like I\u2019m not about to pay for that girls whole life so why would I even be in the room with her having that discussion it doesn\u2019t appeal to me I don\u2019t understand why am I trying to explain anything to her or tell her anything when there is a guy who likes that and we know that for fact.

The 9's and 10's are getting plenty of offers from many girls. Why would they settle for you when they got unlimited variety of food? Sure, there are outliers where they might finally settle down, but that's akin to winning the lottery.\n\nPoint is, if you're actually serious about wanting a long-term relationship then stop swiping on them. You'll get much better dates and much higher chances of them wanting an actual relationship. You can keep swiping on them, but it'll just leave you emotionally drained as they never commit, ghost after using you, cheat on you, or just be an overall jerk during the first (or subsequent) meetings.\n\nOnline dating is a complete joke because of the above vicious cycle. The girls who want a long-term relationship give up on online dating because they think all the guys on there just want sex. Why? Swiping on the 9's and 10's...so they uninstall and stick to IRL dating. Most girls who swipe on the less than 9's typically have so many red flags..hence why the 9's and 10's don't even bother. That's why it's best to just stick with IRL dating. Both people will then actually base their decisions on more than just looks from a buffet.

But if you don\u2019t want kids, you aren\u2019t a \u201chousewife\u201d, especially if you\u2019re not gonna help your husband with cleaning or cooking. At that point you\u2019re a boarder, and a leech.",

Without a woman working in the relationship the guy gets all the stress. Which then leaks into the relationship. Causing problems where there didn't need to be any. Because of the way people think. Where did people get that thought process? Sexism. The idea that women shouldn't work. Who started that way of thinking? Who pushed sexism for thousands of years? Dudes. lol\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what we're seeing is basically dudes convincing women they aren't good enough. Aren't as good as men. Forcing them a place for generations. And now. Some women take that one as how things should be. And guys now hate it. But instead of calling it sexism because that's not only correct and would help a lot of people women get blamed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGirl inches. Pretty much the same thing. Guys lie about their penis size for thousands of years. Some women believe those guys. Say a penis size that sound ridiculous. And guys name if girl inches. Even though the number one liar of penis size is, has been and will continue to be dudes. lol\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBasically it's dude fucking other dudes then blaming women. lol",
