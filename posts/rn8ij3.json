Lots of symbolism involved. It can be viewed as six days (millennia) for mankind to struggle and learn the wisdom of God and upon entering the seventh day (millennia) the people of Israel will become enlightened to all \"esoteric truths and comprehend their Creator's wisdom as is the capacity of man.\"",

You saying \"the numbers are inflated\" with regards to the existence of non-ashkenazi Jews is not a counter argument, you just made it up and it's not how reality works. Next question, why would Jews choose to want to live in a land that is historically the origin of Jews you ask? is that a question you want me to answer? it sounds rhetorical to me.",
