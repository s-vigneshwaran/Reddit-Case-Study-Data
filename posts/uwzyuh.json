This will give you a tool to help pinpoint emotions you might be feeling. Discovering this tool is what first started helping me, before I went to a professional. You use it by recalling a situation which stuck with you for some reason and you use the wheel to pinpoint your emotions/needs in that moment. If you have someone you trust in your life, they can also use this wheel to guess your emotions in that moment. It sounds strange, but I found it hard to describe my own emotions, but easy to agree or disagree with someone else's guess.\n\nGood luck.",

There's been plenty of times where I felt it welling up inside me, but no tears ever came. Sure you can play it off as \"cool\" or \"I'm a badass\", but in reality it makes you feel emotionally broken inside, like you're becoming a psychopath. And unlike the movies, it never seems that way to your loved ones & family, instead they'll call you \"cold\" or \"heartless\".\n\nThe only thing I can relate to anymore is this quote I heard from an actor, \"I don't really cry anymore, in my personal life. The only thing that really makes me cry is the cinema.\" And while it sounds fucked up, it's very true for me as well. When I watch Cuba Gooding Jr. in Pearl Harbor holding his dying captain, who's still trying to give orders, \"Tell Johnson he's in charge now! And call command, tell them...\" And he says, \"They already know. Everybody's where they're supposed to be Captain. You trained us well. You trained us well.\" Watching that scene doesn't fail to make me tear up. (Still doesn't make me feel less weird for crying at fiction, rather than reality.)",

Later he said it was weird of me to cry like that over an animal and of made fun of me for it- I just told him to fuck off.  That animal was a part of my life when I was going through some tumultuous times and was like a rock for me and a reminder of when life was simple.  I couldn't fathom why he was so apathetic to the situation.  Nowadays he has his own dog (a rescue) and treats her better than he treats most women in his life.

The only one that deals with emotions is the 'lack of depth' question, it's unclear whether that is supposed to describe the patients experience of their own emotional state or the assessors observation of their emotional state. The reason people perceive psychopaths (a now outdated term) to lack emotions is because they cannot imagine someone who *can* feel, enjoying or disregarding the harm they cause to another.\n\nRegardless, showing weakness in front of someone, depending on the situation, could be a sign of trust or a manipulation tactic, etc. Emotions are often the driving force of harmful behaviour not a barrier against them.\n\nI'm not a professional but I have an interest in the area, misconceptions annoy me, that's all, especially when it's reinforcing negative stereotypes. :)\nIt's wasn't a commentary on your story just additional knowledge",

I feel for her if it's just that she numbs those feelings & can't really reproduce them to explain what happened, but she legitimately seems a like a psychopath here. It's like watching an AI.",

No, the kid slid off his chair and I found him under the table with big, fat tears rolling down his little face. \"I can't eat it!!\" he sobbed. \"It's too cute!!\" He couldn't bear to hurt the dinosaur. Goldfish crackers were out. Teddy Grahams were out. Anything with a face was off limits. Fucked up birthday cakes something fierce...I finally defaulted to cakes that were more \"scenic,\" so like, plastic snakes and lizards on a cake where the frosting looked like trees/plants; a big sheet cake of plain, white icing, with Star Wars figures planted on top in a scene from Hoth. \n\nThat little toddler turns 21 this year. :-)",

I prefer to say it has many patriarchal elements, because that more easily allows an understanding of misandrist elements too without contradictions.\n\nTake the lack of men's shelters. If the argument is that society is patriarchal and this is the result of anti-woman bias because women are seen as weaker thus needs the help and men as seen as strong so they don't, then to fix it we need to unravel the issues women face to \"solve\" it. If saying it's misandrist then the solution is more straight forward: build more shelters to resolve the imbalance and help those who need it.\n\nNot to say don't address wider issues, absolutely do, but narrowing down to misandry can be very helpful, as I think should be the case with the public respons to this trial.",

It's just not something most women think about. But women have so much unique energy to provide to any relationship.",

                  "text": "I\u2019m sorry, that sucks.\n\nIt really just sucks to hear how much people are suffering in general. When one person suffers it often causes others to suffer, it spreads like a disease.\n\nIt\u2019s just sad because these individuals weren\u2019t inherently born this way, it is almost always due to emotional / physical abuse or trauma in child hood, so if you want to get \u201ctechnical\u201d it isn\u2019t entirely their fault. As I\u2019ve always said: You can\u2019t claim that you would act any different if you were born in their shoes. These individuals don\u2019t want to act or feel this way, I don\u2019t think anyone necessarily desires to be nasty, evil, mean, etc.\n\nMy brother suffers from ASPD which is the root symptom for all of these behavioral disorders (lack of empathy), he also has narcissistic traits.\n\nHe abused me a ton when I was younger, never really physically, but emotionally. He would continuously belittle me and tell me I\u2019m not good enough. It caused significant confidence issues that I wasn\u2019t even aware of until I was 18 and met some really good, confident, popular friends that noticed this issue and significantly helped me out with it. I owe them a lot. This issue paired with the fact that I\u2019m a perfectionist leads to an even greater problem. I\u2019m sure the perfectionist thing was also partially due to him belittling me, and I used to think it was solely due to that, but looking back at my child hood I had perfectionist behavior even as a toddler. I didn\u2019t want to do anything at all unless I was good at it (Like potty training for example)\n\nMy brother is a genuinely great guy these days, after destroying his first real relationship he recognized that he had no ability to express empathy all by himself and sought therapy for 4 years, then when he was 27 (I was 22) he apologized to me for ruining my childhood and started crying, so that showed me that he does have the ability to express some form of empathy after 4 years of therapy, but that\u2019s practically the only time I\u2019ve seen him express empathy in a genuine way (and it\u2019s possible that may not have even been empathy, but I think it was) \n\nHe 100% learned the empathic words and phrases from therapy, but you can tell there\u2019s no emotion behind them, there just words.\n\nIt\u2019s quite sad and I feel awful for him these days, he\u2019s 33 and he can\u2019t find a girlfriend despite dozens of desperate attempts. He\u2019s a great guy, pretty good looking too, but he\u2019ll often say things or do things that clearly indicates he still doesn\u2019t understand it. For example he\u2019ll ask a girl out but tell her that if she wants to go out, she *has* to go on at least 2 dates with him before she makes a decision. which is ridiculous\u2026 He doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nKind of ironic because what if he goes out with her and then *he* doesn\u2019t want to go on a 2nd date? I doubt he would if he didn\u2019t like the first date. But regardless it\u2019s very controlling and pushy, the first date should be super casual, but he wants to make it elaborate and detailed. He pushes them all away by doing that.\n\nAnyway, just thought I\u2019d share my thoughts.",

I\u2019ve been through that as I\u2019m sure we all have, the first girl I fell in love with was by complete accident, I didn\u2019t even realize I felt that way until one day it suddenly occurred to me, and then I immediately fell into a very depressed state.\n\nShe was my best friends girlfriend, and he didn\u2019t really want to be with her anymore, at times he would tell me that he wishes she would just break up with him so he doesn\u2019t have to deal with the emotions that come from having to have to confront her and break up with her. Kind of cowardly. He didn\u2019t treat her well at all, and these days (5 years later) he finally realizes that.\n\nIt drove me absolutely insane because I deeply loved her, she was my best friend for years. She knew as well, but we never discussed it. I had to stop hanging out with them as it was emotionally killing me. Some time passed whist putting in a ton of emotional effort to accept the reality that I would never be with her, and then just as I felt I had started to get to that point she decided to break up with him as she found out he had cheated. Shortly after she asked to go out, so we did a few times, but I ultimately couldn\u2019t follow through with dating her, my conscience would never allow it seeing as she had dated my best friend for 3 years, so I let her go and it destroyed me for many many years. The most crippling depression one could ever feel, it was completely disabling. I couldn\u2019t function or work a job at all for a long time.\n\nAs of today I like to think I\u2019ve moved on, but then there\u2019s moments that remind me I haven\u2019t. I think I\u2019ve just completely shut off my emotions, I can\u2019t seem to feel those emotions for another women at all. I\u2019m hoping one day that will change. I\u2019m sure I need some kind of therapy but just haven\u2019t brought myself around to it.\n\nHopefully the same will happen to you and you\u2019ll learn to trust a man again, we\u2019re not all bad, but I can understand that the lack of trust is not something that\u2019s so much in your control, it\u2019s just the way our subconscious mind protects us.\n\nGood talkin with ya though, wish you the best!",

If I really feel like I need to cry, I wait until bedtime and watch something really sad. Then I let it all out and basically cry myself to sleep. It's a really toxic way of life and is mentally exhausting, to the point where, even with a good night of sleep, I'll start falling asleep at work because keeping up mental barriers takes all my energy away. And it's so engraved into me now that it would take years to get rid of this. I'll probably end up going mad at some point and finish my life in an asylum or something. I also suffer from crippling depression, and even my shrink doesn't give a fuck and just writes me prescriptipns for happy pills with even listening to what I want to say.",

I get it, it's hard to drop your guard around people, but that doesn't mean that you can never drop your guard. Keeping your emotions in check is good, but knowing when/where to vent them is better.\n\nA good cry session can help you process the shit. Even if you don't cry, just having someone to vent to can really help. You would not believe how much a good talk can help reduce stress.\n\nA few weeks ago, someone hit my car, on my birthday. I was late to work because of it. All in all, I was pretty upset. Now, I could've just acted like nothing was wrong, but that would've just made the problem worse. That frustration would've just eaten away at me. So, I called my best friend and we just talked for an hour. After it, I felt so much calmer and more collected.\n\nPutting on a brave face is a temporary fix. You've got to deal with your emotions or they will deal with you.",

I think it eventually leads to which ways we under or overcompensate. \n\nIn some ways we do occasionally overcompensate in the favor of women. Not every accusation is true. After all, abused people often become abusers. And sometimes narcissistic personalities lead women to take advantage of social norms.\n\nBut on the whole I think women are probably still struggling with this. It took the entirety of MeToo to get Weinstein to trial and that was only five years ago. (E: also see Blizzard and their unwillingness to address abysmally bad behavior) Meanwhile sexual assault hasn\u2019t been in the spotlight pretty much at all. I doubt much has changed for them. \n\nAnd I actually think the solution is actually to better teach and support boys, not just criticize abusjve men, but not a single person on the left or right is really pushing for that. Probably because nobody knows how, exactly.",

I didn't say men can't be victims. I didn't say if it were reversed I'd feel bad for her. I don't think either of them are great people and anyone trying to convince me Depp is only shitty because he is a victim is wasting their time.  I genuinely do not care about these two extremely privileged people who are so bored they have to ruin their own lives. Take your \"but men are victims\" somewhere else that actually matters like where real men are ignored or pushed aside. Depp is fine, he CLEARLY has emotional and financial support. He doesn't need a Reddit army worshiping him on top of it.  He got into a relationship with a woman half his age and it was shit. I'm shocked it wasn't a mature deep relationship that was nurturing and based solely on love like all of you are. Put your energy into people who actually need it.",

He's a goddamn hollywood movie star, passing out from meth and shitting their pants is just par for the course. He had multiple ex-girlfriends who left him for similar reasons. And hell, you wanna sit there and tell me with a straight face that Amber is sober?\n\nIf she had been honest about the experience, no one would care this much. They'd support her! Hell, they might even hate Depp. \n\nBut she lied, and it's bad enough that she tried *and succeeded* in labelling him as an abusive person, *but she was actually the abuser all along.* It's so much worse than either of those things on their own. \n\nIt *literally* vindicates Johnny: this is a defamation suit after all. Johnny might be a mess on a self-destructive course, but that's not nearly as bad as being a narcissistic, spouse-beating, misandrist, pathological liar, who tried to destroy a mans life to bolster her own career.\n\nAnd furthermore, as people have said, being with someone like that doesn't do you any favors. Even a saint is going to turn into a bitter asshole the tenth time their girlfriend punches them in the face and then has the gall to say \"oh please, I didn't punch you, I was *hitting* you, be a man!\"",

I started following the trial as a diversion from the drag of the more serious stuff I'm normally talking about based on the initial impression, like yours, they were just two shitty mutually abusive people going at each other, but even her friends appearing as her witnesses are testifying to how much they like and still care about Depp... have to say it changed my opinion. \n\nEspecially with the clear emotional abuse she's on tape humiliating him with... it's not like the terrible comments about her were completely out of nowhere. She's on tape belittling him and questioning his manhood *for walking away from her physical abuse* and refusing to get into screaming matches. Few people have the restraint to never say terrible things about someone who's doing that to them. If the genders were more typically oriented, I don't think people would have trouble understanding how abuse drives someone to make the kind of comments that form the basis of complaints over how Depp talked about Heard.",

Johnny was attempting to leave and Amber was physically blocking him and pressuring him to not leave.\n\nPeople who are abusive typically do not seek to get away from their victims, and are extremely controlling of where they go, who they are near and who they interact with and will try to isolate them as much as possible. Johnny let Amber Heard's friends and her sister move into adjacent penthouses rent free.\n\nThe trial where he was found responsible for 12 of 14 allegations that court also threw out the medical documents saying that Amber had no injuries, and there's only one picture that Amber submitted that showed any visible injury and that was for the allegation that Johnny punched her dozens of times in the face and it only shows a single bruise on her arm. There are several photographs and videos showing no injuries on Amber either the next day or a few days after Johnny allegedly assaulted her and caused visible injuries.  \n\n\nEdit: meant proof of the audio of Amber admitting she hit Johnny being edited",

She clearly suffers from an ASPD disorder because it\u2019s obvious she doesn\u2019t know how to express true human emotion, IE empathy, and that\u2019s why her testimony is so cringey (well that and also because she\u2019s constantly lying)",

It's not about who's an awful person, because, let's be honest, most celebs nowadays are - its about abuse in relationships and slander. If you followed the trial, you should have noticed that according to witnesses, Heard has shown abusive behaviour in the past (even her own family won't disagree), whereas Depp (according to his Friends & Ex-partners) has never displayed the behavior she claims to have experienced. Like it or not, Turd is 100% responsible for the mess she is in now and in my opinion what she is doing is damaging for feminism and what it stands for. There are so many women around the world who experience this shit IRL, on a daily and lying about it shows how fucked up this person is.\nSry for grammar, English isn't my first language.",

Nobody has a go at men for crying at funerals or when people have died.  When men cry is means something.  If one of my male friends or relatives started crying I'd take it with the utmost seriousness because it must be something really bad. \n\nYou just don't go crying like a little bitch at every little thing.

If you read the uncut transcripts of that two hour conversation they had which was cut down to 40 minutes and leaked by one of Depp's former lawyers, they both reference this behavior. After he does this the first time, he invites her to the Bahamas where she says she absolutely fell for Depp. I think I skipped a bit ahead at this point, about 9 mins before the timestamp started.\n\nThe judge, I think, asks her about the first time Depp hit her. Heard says they were on the couch, Depp had been drinking and she remembers seeing a pot of cocaine he may or may not have been taking. She asks him about a tattoo she thought look weird, which Depp responded something to the effect of, \"It means Why No.\" Heard said she laughed, after which Depp slapped her. After being struck the third time, she looks at Depp, describing how she felt stunned and confused by the situation, and he starts crying. Then she says it was weird for her, probably due to the context of the situation and due to the fact that she claims she's never seen a grown man cry. The whole situation left her stunned, and she went to the car and eventually left. The next day, she described calling her therapist and that's when I stopped watching.\n\nYes, out of context it's a bad look for Heard. In the context of her recount of the situation, it's just part of the confusion of the heat of the moment after being struck by Depp.\n\nAnd notice, that's how this whole circus has been. People online say something short, quippy, funny and entirely out of context and it takes a lot of effort to debunk it. It's just how the internet is sometimes. \n\nAnd FWIW, this behavior of abuse is very common where the abuser will bring a period of remorse after an incident.\n\nhttps://domesticviolence.org/cycle-of-violence/\n\nhttps://www.thehotline.org/",

I understand what she means and the jump cuts make it sound worse than what it is. As a Mexican male, i was told that crying is seen as a weakness and makes you less of a man. I imagine this is true in a lot of cultures and the trend of not putting men into a box and actually encouraging males to be vulnerable is very new, so it's not surprising for Amber to never have seen her father cry because he probably did never cry in front of anyone. I wouldn't be surprised if Johnny is really the first or one of the first men that has ever cried in front of Amber.",

Also pretty uncomfortable to see anybody crying generally.\n\nI didn't see a grown man cry until I was 21. And that was my ex when we were breaking up.

Her go to insults were \"you're not a man\", along with various other insults on my masculinity. \n\nThis is not the only partner I've been emasculated for showing emotions too. Before her I opened up to a partner on issues I was having in the relation with her and her reply was \"OHHH, poor you, a straight white man, your life must be sooooo hard\". \n\nConsidering, I tend to date extremely liberal partners, I'm guessing this problem of men being attack by partners for showing emotions is far far more common than we think.\n\nSo now, when I cry, I just do it alone.

I hope to god you never have male children or children at all if this is the way you think as you will probably psychologically damage them into thinking the same way you do.",

More specifically, she was raised by an abusive macho man father who she had never seen cry. So in general, yes, I'm sure it did feel weird to see Johnny cry. People dissecting every little thing she does is only done for the benefit of quick read posts like these,  and these posts are made for people who aren't actually keeping up with the trial by itself. I'm tired of seeing it in unrelated subs like this just for karma",
