  "text": "TIFU by introducing my widower dad to my husband's single mom.\n(Obligatory \"didn't happen today.\")\n\nMy husband and I have been married for 5 and a half years now. My husband was raised by a single mom, and my mom passed when I was 16, so each of us only had one parent at the wedding.\n\nOur parents met during the wedding planning, and quickly discovered how much they had in common and how well they got along. After a few too many glasses of wine, they danced together at the wedding reception.\n\nWe noticed a little bit of flirtation between them, but didn't think much of it until they started seeing each other regularly after the wedding, going out together for drinks, going on walks together, going fishing together. Even though it was a little weird for us that our parents were ambiguously and later officially dating each other, we truly didn't care because they just seemed so happy.\n\nYesterday, my husband walked his mom down the aisle to meet my dad at the altar. My husband's mom and my dad said their vows, and became husband and wife. And my husband and I became... stepsiblings.\n\nTldr: my husband's mom and my dad started a romance at our wedding, and yesterday they got married, which makes my husband and I technically stepsiblings.",

I never saw her anymore and wondered where she was. But honestly, she was just smart to avoid our fucked up family and all my mom+her siblings interpersonal drama. She beat me by several years. I, too, quit that side of the family. \n\nYou can just stop going. You can decide to go to Hawaii for Christmas every year. You can do whatever you want. When you start saying \"no\" and taking your power back, you will be amazed!! \n\nAlso, when the grandparents die and the cousins all have kids of their own, it is time for families to break off and make new traditions. IMO. \n\nLol I said estrangement as kind of a joke but I am actually estranged by choice and it is actually very beneficial to me.",

He died when he was 82... a week to the day before his son turned 9. I remember my dad (whose relative it was - his uncle) explaining it to my sister and me as just a thing that some people did, and not something to judge people for. I was 10 or 11 when I met them for the first time, the kids were I think 4 and 6 at the time.\n\nAs I got older my dad was more able to admit to me that it was pretty fucked up, and he was able to tell me a lot more stuff about that family that was weird. My dad has a cousin that's his age (60-70s) from this uncle's first marriage, a cousin that's about 15 years older than me (so halfway between my age and my dad's) from this uncle's second (and best) marriage, and two cousins that are younger than me from this uncle's third (and worst) marriage. Several other family members believe that the oldest cousin (Da's age) is a spy with the CIA. The lovely woman from the second marriage remained the matriarch even after her divorce, owned the family home, and cared for everyone in the family. The wench from the third marriage allowed and encouraged her youngest child (whom she gave birth to when I believe she was at the youngest about 49 years old, possibly older) to have \"sleepovers\" with her boyfriend, a 26 year old man, when she was 14.\n\nWe don't talk to that wench anymore, nor does much of the family.",

I feel bad for OP because its really not her fault or anybodys \"fault\". But they're going to have to be careful about how they approach it because bullies can really tear a kid down. Hopefully any future kids of theirs can own it and make it something they don't let get to them and can laugh about themselves. I have hope for this family hearing their story \ud83d\ude0a",

It blew their minds that without anyone giving birth as an underaged minor, it was possible to become a grandparent in your 30s.  Especially back in the day, women often got married at 18-19 years old.  My grandmother did, and became a mom at 18 as well.  Her daughter followed suit, so my grandmother was a grandmother at 36 years old! She could have easily had a kid after that.  My mom waited until she was in her late 20s.  It kind of blows my mind when I look at my BFFs youngest - she had him when we were 36... so I look at him and think \"he could be my grandchild\".",

I went to school and did sports with her and her 2 sisters. We will call the wife J and the husband A. J and A started dating in high school. They got married shortly (year or two) after high school. Both J and A's parents ended up divorcing while the kids were in school. At the wedding all the parents were single. The parents hit it off but with opposite. They danced her mom with his dad and vice versa. 2 years after the wedding J and A got pregnant. At the baby shower A's mom let it slip that she and J's dad were going to start living together. Then J's mom mentions that she and A's dad are talking marriage. By the time 5 years from J and A's wedding anniversary came around both sets of parents had remarried. They were now siblings x2.  And had bought the house across the street from me as they were expecting baby #2. I now had both sets of parents, J and A, and J's sisters all lived within a mile and a half of me. Their kids grew up with the jokes about their parents being siblings. The kids would joke about \"aunt-mommy\". When their daughter would get in trouble for pushing her little brother she would say \"but I was pushing my cousin\". It was their normal. After about 15 years of marriage J and A divorced but they had to make it work because not only did they have children to be concerned with but also because they are step-siblings. When J's youngest sister was on a softball team with A's brother there were a lot of jokes about how you shouldn't hook up with your sibling and such. It makes for a weird family dynamic especially in public when the kids say \"uncle-dad\" and the like.",

Also, that new child is an uncle to his siblings.\n\nIt was so messed up. I can't imagine explaining that to anyone. \"Yeah, he's my dad but also my brother.

So the four of them ended up spending a lot of time together. My uncle passed away in 2013 maybe? and my mom passed in 2018. My aunt and my step-dad were already really good friends, and they loved each other very much, so a romance wasn't that much of a stretch. They only dated for about a year, but my step-dad ended it because my aunt wasn't over my uncle's death. Then, my step-dad moved back to Texas right before the pandemic, but unfortunately he passed away last month (not Covid).",

In considering the duration of death or civil separation laws, I don\u2019t see the point of mentioning it. \n\nI suppose it depends on the civil law of each state and on the OPs religious background, really. \n\nI just don\u2019t see the point of making their marriage a matter of perversity or taboo. I don\u2019t see it as such. I guess that\u2019s called \u201cgrace.\u201d",

My mom was a guest at the shower as well as my husband's uncle who was a divorcee x 2. Long story short they had known each other for a long time as they were from the same small town. The baby shower was in June. My daughter was born in August....my mom and my husband's uncle married end of August, same year. We became cousins.....they are no longer together now.

And some possible problems in the way, because if they both argue and have some divergences and fights, you and your husband could end up having to pick sides and then start a problem in your own relationship because of them; and if you two have tough problems too, it would be them two against you two probably. In my POV, it's more about practical and logical things than being \"late brothers\" xD",

It\u2019s been a couple of years and they live together across the street from my parents but it\u2019s something we still struggle with. When I introduce them I start by saying this is my cousin so and so and this is their boyfriend so and so who also happens to be my cousin. We give them a lot of shit about it.

If someone is concerned about the fact that spouses are in a situation where they can technically also be described \"step-siblings\" just remember that the term is overly simplified out of necessity and only describes basic marriage connections and such but nothing else.  The term does not describe whether you met as children  and were raised as siblings, or met as completely not-related adults meeting for the purpose of dating and only became \"step-siblings\" later through the technicality of someone *elses* marriage.  \n\nI think if the jokey aspect of the term actually does bother anyone involved, just don't use that term and put your foot down (kindly) if anyone tries to use the term by letting them know that you really are not actual step-siblings in the way that people actually mean the term when they say it, and it's kind of stealing other people's identity to try to pretend you have that sort of relationship when it clearly doesn't describe your relationship at all, so they should probably not make that joke because that term might actually mean something to actual step-siblings who were raised as step-siblings.\n\nI'm not a linguist but the linguists I've met are really amazing at describing these sort of things, so I hope one can chime in with their thoughts.  They would certainly do a MUCH better job than I have on this subject.",

Both my dad and SO's mother seemed very lonely so we had the great idea to invite both of them to attend a local town festival with us.  They hit it off right away.  They decided to go their own way and get something to eat.  Later that night as we pulled into the driveway, looking into the bay window in the front of the house it was apparent they didn't realize the curtains weren't see through.  A few month's later my SO became my step-sibling.  A few months after that we predictably broke up.",

My great great grandfather took his son\u2019s advice and met my great great grandmother and they eventually married. So my great grandparents were spouses and step-siblings.",
