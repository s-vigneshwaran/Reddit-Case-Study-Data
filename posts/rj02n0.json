  "text": "TIFU my girlfriend caught me jerking off to my ex\u2019s nudes\nThis happened 3-4 hours ago today. So I\u2019ve been with my current girlfriend for over a year a now and we got together six months after me and my ex broke up.\n\nMy girlfriend was out doing Christmas shopping today and I was having a relaxed day off of work so I decided with the place to myself to jerk off. \n\nDecided to put some porn on but after 40 minutes I was getting frustrated and couldn\u2019t cum so when this happens I go to my ex\u2019s nudes and videos she sent to me so I put some headphones and started going to one of her videos. \n\nMy girlfriend came home but I couldn\u2019t hear she came home so she walked over to me to get my attention or to like maybe start something clearly seeing what I was doing but she saw my ex\u2019s face moaning on my phone and ran out shouting\n\nShe drove and isn\u2019t answering her phone It\u2019s been 3 hours and she still hasn\u2019t come home what the fuck do I do to make this right\n\nTLDR: my girlfriend of almost two years caught me jerking off to my ex\u2019s nudes she left and I haven\u2019t seen her\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve deleted all the videos and pictures and she messaged me just saying we will talk when I get home\n\nEdit 2: Me and my GF talked so she thought I was video chatting with my ex I explained it was an old video and she said that was better than video chatting but she still was hurt so we talked it through we aren\u2019t breaking up but I\u2019m heading to my parents for Christmas and she\u2019s going to hers for Christmas. I\u2019ve given her the password to my phone and laptop and showed her they are all deleted but I\u2019m sleeping on the couch till she feels comfortable having me in bed\n\nEdit 3: This should be the final update we\u2019ve decided couples counselling after Christmas would be a good idea for us moving forward. I know a lot of Redditors are gonna be mad she wants to work on things and I\u2019m shocked she does. I feel like I\u2019ve been given the biggest second chance ever. \nI don\u2019t want want to recover the nudes so people please stop trying to help with that. thank you to everyone who gave me advice but I\u2019m staying on the couch till we both get back after New Years",

Somehow a second machine is built and there is some way to prevent incoming travelers so someone has to go to the original point in time travel and detonate a nuke. The nuke never detonates but they stop the aliens first invasion somehow then bam a tv show of timegate:tg1 begins where they travel to other aliens and worlds who made time travel and fight the remaining time lords.",

Better for each iteration to copy the video on to a new USB stick rather than just passing the original until it's hundreds of years old).\n\nThe first and second iterations will be the most risky ones, but once you're at the third iteration where no one either saw the tragedy directly or spoke with the one who saw it directly, if the loop continues, it should be fairly stable.\n\nBut watch out for others starting their own time loops that might just erase your hard work entirely. To avoid this, it's probably best to start a secret time travel watchdog group that prevents any unauthorized loops from starting, then grandfather your own loop in as authorized (by carving it into a stone you bury 500 million years ago).\n\nYou'll need to cover all of this in your original time loop video btw so that each iteration knows to start the secret time police organization and manipulate them into thinking your time loop is necessary for the survival of the species.\n\nBut if the secret time police ever discover that video, they might ruin everything, so you need to start a second even more secret org to make sure the first one doesn't ever get too close to the truth. And add instructions for this to the video. And protect it with another layer of secret orgs.\n\nYou can probably see that this is an infinite loop, and given that, eventually you'll run out of people to run these organizations. So you'll need to go back on time yet again and start up colonies wherever you can manage it to increase the population to the point where it can staff more layers. The Moon, Mars, Venus' upper atmosphere, the dark side of Mercury, some moons of Jupiter and Saturn, some larger meteors.\n\nTime is on your side, so you could seed nearby star systems just by going back far enough in time to launch a generational starship such that by the time you need more people to staff secret time police organizations, they are ready. A hint that might help do this more efficiently: to seed Andromeda, go *forward* in time to the point where it's colliding with our Galaxy, then go back in time in Andromeda's frame of reference oh maybe a billion years or so to give them enough time to figure out FTL travel so that they can send more staff once you've used to the Milky Way's entire population.\n\nAnd *that* is how you avoid creating a time travel paradox simply by closing the time loop from the start.",

I can tell you though that with my fianc\u00e9 when apart, video calls or even just pics in general makes it a whole hell of a lot better than some random video on the internet. It\u2019s because it\u2019s about that connection you currently have or once had. With all that said I firmly believe that you really should have nothing from an ex if you are in a relationship. It\u2019s very unhealthy for both people and the relationship as a whole. But if you are single and are holding on than yes I can see why.",

I'd say no.

To assume otherwise would seem naive to me in the extreme.\n\nOnce you share nudes with someone you really have no rights over them, and you shouldn't be feeling 'violated' or whatever after the relationship ends if they were 'in use' by your ex. Yes, it would be the decent thing to do for the ex to delete them. But the ex might equally and reasonably assume that what someone is ignorant of can't hurt them, and that is just a fact.",

It only takes one vindictive ex or someone who somehow gets access to your account or the underlying network to turn your life upside down. \n\nUnless you want to be a porn star (nothing wrong with that, by the way), most wouldn't be OK with their nudes being out on the web or dark web. The moment you decide to be a porn star, you must accept all the judgement that comes with it, fair or unfair. It precludes you from having relationships, personal and business, with a multitude of people who have already passed judgment on you. This is just the way life works. If you can't make a lot of money for yourself with your nudes, what's the point? Clearly it's just orgasm. So, doing that for something this basic is just plain stupid; you risk a lot and your gain is a basic bodily function. Like I said before, if you're with someone who doesn't give you what you need in the bedroom, that signifies a problem on your end or theirs. If you're so fixated on sex that you can't use your logical brain to see the risks of doing xyz, you're little more than a wild animal. That's sad.",

Your ideas of sex seem insanely simplistic. People enjoy nudes of their partners because of the emotional attachment that goes with them, the entire point is that it's the opposite of watching porn just to get off. You literally don't understand the motivations behind it so this is a very strange concept to explain, but holy fuck, you're way off.",

As I said before, there is a ton of porn on the internet, I don't need to use my imagination to jerk it.\n\nPast sexual experiences are, to me, just a thing I did in the past. I don't care to go back and relive them, it happened, it was cool, that's about it.\n\nThat being said, if someone wants to think about their ex when jerking it, that is fine (weird and a little creepy, but fine). Keeping an intimate gift of an image or video of their nude body from someone who likely no longer wants you to have it is what is not fine.",

They were together so obviously there were some positives but he's not there any more. Can't have a relationship with someone who feels insecure that you are attracted to others. Attraction will happen and it isn't an offense to your partner.  Dissect those feelings for 2 seconds.  If they feel attraction threatens their relationship are they under the impression that their partner is with them only for sexual attraction?   Do they feel that their partner has no control over themselves and will act on any attraction?   If that's actually true then don't be with that person.",

Everyone you've dated has thought of an ex when they masturbated. They found that person attractive and unless they were so terrible to them that they can't stand their memory then they still find them attractive. Keeping the pics is wrong as his ex did not intend those to be used after they broke up but his ex should be mad about that. This is just a continuation of the singular attraction idea. No one is only attracted to their partner. No one worth dating betrays your trust just because they are attracted to someone else. If you can't trust your partner to deal with attraction to others without betraying trust either you have trust issues or they are untrustworthy.",

That has no bearing on whether or not you're a scummy bastard if you keep nudes of someone you broke up with 3 years ago. Extra scumbag points if it was someone you ghosted, or someone you wouldn't even acknowledge on the street.\n\nSending someone a photo as part of an intimate relationship is not consent for them to keep that photo and wank to it for the next 50 years. It's consent for them to wank to it at that moment. Maybe you're young, maybe you're very trusting, maybe they coerced you into it, maybe you think that's what people want these days, maybe you think this person is your forever, maybe you just like sending people photos and assumed they wouldn't be a douchcanoe and keep it even after you broke up. The same way just because you made out with someone once that doesn't mean you still want to two years down the line. Or the same way if you told your next door neighbour they're welcome to borrow your lawnmower anytime no need to ask - you would think it was fucking weird if they moved away, you hadn't spoken in 11 months but suddenly they come round and take your lawnmower. The consent is given in a fixed context and that context is not perpetual.\n\nAnd honestly, even if it *was* consent, it would still be fucked up to be keeping naked photos of people you haven't seen in years, and it's disrespectful as fuck to them, and it's *literally insane* to be doing if you have a new partner (for the same reasons of disrespect and ickyness but with added emotional complications).",

I've never been with anyone for longer than three years so I really can't speak for more established relationships but I do feel it's worth considering that the longer you've been with this person, the longer they've had their exes nudes which I feel like would make it worse for me personally, especially if I was married to this person.

That shows you still have a physical (and perhaps emotional) attraction to your ex.

In his real world, his own GF isn't good enough to get his rocks off that he chooses his ex-GF from 2 years ago. \n\nAlso, I echo the comments where if he can't get off to porn after 40 min then he's got an issue that needs to be looked at. I get that finding the \"right\" porn can be an effort with the bazillion videos out there, but it isn't his first time. Why hasn't he saved a video that he's had good results with before? Instead, it sounds like he *regularly* turns to his ex-GF when he can't find a good porn.",

If they say that it is fine it literally doesn't matter, though I wouldn't suggest keeping/jerking off to them if you are in a new relationship regardless of ex-consent.

I agree with the quote (people definitely aren't property), but not with the idea that that means anything in regards to the videos. That people aren't property means you can't use their body against their will (consent, rape, etc). But the reason you have to return the videos is a moral determination and realistically no different than why you should return (if physical) and/or delete (if digital) any items that are of a personal or emotional nature and acquired while in a relationship.",

A ring is a single item, that has value, that you can't access without the original item. A sexy pic/vid is digital bytes on a device that can be easily duplicated, yet (generally) has no monetary value to the creator.\n\nA ring you want back to return and get your money back. A video you want *destroyed* so the person can't look at it anymore, or further distributed.\n\n>Either way you can\u2019t ask for that stuff back, once it\u2019s out there, no refunds.\n\nThis isn't how anything works, there's nothing that prevents or precludes asking for something back just because you already gave it to someone. Using your logic, nothing can ever be requested back because you'd only need to request it back if you gave it away... which you say isn't allowed.",

She sent them, the relationship ended, and now he has those nudes. She can only trust that he do anything nefarious with them, but that\u2019s on her. And if OP still has them, well\u2026too bad for the ex. Maybe she should have thought about that before. \n\nPeople put too much trust and faith into this society.

In Germany there was a case in which a man simply retaining his ex's nudes against her will was deemed illegal.

I bet if you told women that you were going to keep every nude image they send you forever, no matter what happens between you, they wouldn't be as willing to send them.\n\nEdit: Even if they don't explicitly say it. If you think someone wouldn't be okay with you holding on to their nudes after a breakup, then you're being disrespectful. It's only ever been explicitly stated in my one of my relationships that they be deleted if we break up, but I just felt in every other case that they wouldn't want me to hold onto anything they sent me, so out of respect I deleted them. I don't care if they cheated on me or disrespected me first. Like I said, I try not to give myself excuses for poor behavior on my part.",

When I send nudes, I agree to the fact that everything online is permanent and I consciously take that risk. \n\nIf someone is so untrustworthy as to potentially use the nudes as blackmail, how can you possibly trust (especially without having the conversation!!!) that they'd delete them. It's completely unreasonable.\n\nBut also, not all relationships have to end crashing and burning, as somebody else said.

We stayed together for another couple years, but I went from adoration to suspicious the rest of the time we were together. I would make passive aggressive comments. I would question whether she was really hanging out with friends, or if her friends were covering for her so she could sneak around and do whatever she wanted. Eventually my inability to just get over it, and the attitude I allowed it to create ended up pushing her to actually cheat on me. And it\u2019s one of those weird moments where it\u2019s like \u201caha! I knew you were gonna do it!\u201d But in hindsight, when I knew how it was affecting me, I should have cut the cord and moved on. It would have saved me a lot of heartache, and it would have saved her a lot of stress too. It was a self-fulfilled prophecy situation.\n\nI think OP should give it some time, see if his partner can truly get over it, and if she seemingly does, then great. But if months down the road she references it, makes passive aggressive comments, continually punishes him, or reminds him of his fuck up - he needs to do the right thing and let her find someone she can trust and not feel hurt by. But again, he should give it time. People do have the capacity to be understanding and let mistakes go.",

There are plenty of times in relationships where people are faced with something worth breaking up over - and that's still never an excuse to cheat. It's admirable that you see that you made the relationship worse, but it's still on them for cheating instead of leaving.",

I should have broken things off at that point that I knew I couldn\u2019t trust her anymore, and she should have broken things off at the point that she eventually felt compelled to cheat. It\u2019s an odd paradigm, but I would rather understand my actions like an adult, rather than just solely blame her and absolve myself as a victim like a child.\n\nedit: The amount of people telling me it was okay for me to be controlling, or anything similar, is very alarming. It\u2019s never okay to be controlling. At best it\u2019s understandable on what leads someone to be controlling when they otherwise aren\u2019t that kind of person, but people shouldn\u2019t dupe themselves to believe that kind of behavior is okay. It\u2019s abusive, and extremely toxic. If you find yourself becoming like that, just leave the relationship. Or get counseling. Don\u2019t let yourself become that kind of person.",

It\u2019s not like you can just beat the living shit out of a woman over and over and scream at her and demean her in every possible way but that if she fucks some other dude after a couple years of abuse, she\u2019s made the final choice to cheat.\n\nLike, why are we saying that it\u2019s a faithful relationship simply because she hasn\u2019t had any other penises in her vagina (for example) but it\u2019s still a faithful relationship if he\u2019s given her a black eye? I\u2019m not playing word games here, I hope I\u2019m being clear. What I\u2019m saying is that in the example I\u2019m giving, which is all too common still, the abuser has abolished the relationship so the concept of cheating cannot exist.\n\nTo be clear, I agree with you that in most circumstances, the choice to cheat rests solely with the cheater. But it\u2019s more of a spectrum or a continuum or something like that. At some point you get to where it\u2019s not so black and white. My abuser example was admittedly extreme, so maybe it\u2019s not the best, but I wanted to illustrate my thinking that there are absolutely examples where there\u2019s no conventional \u201cblame\u201d.",

I\u2019m also just gonna put it out there, people with this kind of energy, people who keep nude content with of their exes and, far more importantly, keep this as a secret in your relationship, they\u2019re not good or trustworthy people. If you get burned and keep going, you\u2019re likely to get burned harder later down the line. A girl I dated in high school told me after 5 months together that she kissed her ex the other day, and she was crying and asking for forgiveness and whatever.. I let it go, and less than 3 months later I found out she was sleeping with a coworker for at least the last 4 months, was probably using the kissing a coworker thing to vent guilt, test me, and try to break things off easier.. I found out the day after she dumped me to move in with him \ud83d\ude43\n\nPoint is, cheaters cheat. Even if it\u2019s just emotional cheating like keeping nudes from exes and hiding that from your partner (to clarify again, the nudes *could be* acceptable, the hiding is the unacceptable part), it highlights a behavioral issue and a certain trust deficit. Often times, it\u2019s best to move on quickly before things get worse and you wind up questioning your self worth for years. Sorry this happened to you :(",

After the disclosure, couldn\u2019t choose to leave but also couldn\u2019t let it go and became massively paranoid and controlling. Eventually I went to a 12-step program called S-Anon which is for people who have been impacted by someone else\u2019s sexual behavior. I got better. I didn\u2019t have to try to manipulate his behaviors or snoop to trust my intuition when things were getting out of hand again, and eventually I broke it off after 5 years (I did not cheat). Every action has a reaction and she was the catalyst here. It wasn\u2019t a self-fulfilling prophecy - she didn\u2019t have integrity and was a cheat. You responded to that energy with controlling behaviors rather than leaving. Hindsight is 20/20, maybe you can think you should have left but it sounds as though you learned that the hard way. She had a choice to stay or go as well and not act without integrity. \n\nI just wanted to say give yourself grace. It sounds like you did a lot of reflection and are much healthier now.

Found someone else who treated me in a way that didn\u2019t constantly cause stress and ended my previous relationship to move on. \n\n\nThe tons of heartache and stress weren\u2019t worth it in hindsight (for either of us). But neither of us had the emotional wherewithall to know things were over as soon as I created a rift she couldn\u2019t excuse.

That's just nonsense. Someone who didn't want to cheat would just get sick of the suspicion and break up.\n\nSo she's just was using you as an excuse to deflect blame off herself. Obviously it's good to look at what role you played in it but if she cheated - fuck her. That was her decision to find another dude to fuck and that tells you who she really is.\n\nBetween cheating and long-term maintained lies, my trust in relationships in general has been shattered. I'm constantly asking myself how I can not have those paranoid, jealous feelings. And my current solution is to stay single. Easier that way than dealing with people.",

In real life I am always so calm and tolerant, and genuinely feel compassion for the people I meet daily; but I find on reddit, I often come across as meaner than I want, or I just say things that aren't very nice. They don't sound bad in my head, but when I re-read it, I wince. It brings out the worst in me, and I am trying to be better about it.\n\n\nAll that to say that sometimes, circumstances or people affect us in ways that surprise us. Some relationships just bring out that part of us that we don't like, and it's only with experience and hindsight that we understand we should have booked it earlier. In the future, you'll have the tools you need to make better decisions for yourself. And that's the best we can do - learn from life and move forward.

I should have broken up with her when she started letting her feelings for her ex interfere with our relationship (she would talk to him, tell me about it, and then ignore me for the rest of the day to sulk about him).

Cheating just seems like a natural progression i.e. my partner won't give me what I want right this second so I'll get it from another person. I had to learn the hard way that some things are dealbreakers for me, and you learned one, too. \n\nTrust *cannot* be repaired without a lot of acceptance and effort to change. I mean A LOT. I dealt with a major breach of trust with my ex, and while he was contrite for a day or so, he quickly swung to what's the big deal, i already said I was sorry, stop guilting me jeez. Needing to work through damaged trust and boundaries isn't the same thing as trying to guilt trip someone. But that's why its so hard to navigate and frequently just kills the relationship. People don't like to look at themselves in the mirror while admitting they were selfish and hurt someone who trusted them.",

It also depends on how much the relationship is worth. I checked my SO into an inpatient mental hospital, and we went to therapy - it first started about 7 years ago, treatment was about 5 years ago, and therapy about 3-4 years ago. It doesn't magically go away, especially when that trust is stomped on, but if you actually fix the underlying issues, and work at it, you can get through it. I've been able to say in the last 1-2 years that I fully trust him again. It was worth it to me that he had support going through this to make a full recovery, and he's grown tremendously as a person and is finally stable mentally, getting his depression/anxiety into a manageable state.\n\nFor OP, I would want to understand why he thought it was okay to jerk off to an ex and why he saved those nudes. A simple promise of \"I won't do it again\" doesn't really show that he understands the reasons leading up to the mistake and is liable to fail similarly in the future, in a related but \"I didn't break my original promise\" type situation. It's not as serious as the issues I've gone through, but they might need some space to work through those issues, and a therapist can help create that space if they can't on their own.

Because.... It's a fucking nude of their ex. It basically IS cheating, but ALSO the ex probably didn't consent to it so it's almost worst in some ways. I had the same thing happen to me, I freaked out, said if he didn't delete the photos I would break up. He did, supposedly, but in hindsight, I just should've broken up. Because the relationship only got worse from there. \n\nPeople who do this can't respect basic boundaries, and very likely don't respect the people making them either. That's what I learned over the course of two years, anyways. Don't blame yourself, you ignored a massive red flag and it came back to bite you, because honestly, why wouldn't someone be willing to cross the line into physcially cheating if they're willing to inch that close to it? It's so disrespectful, only a really shitty person would do something like that. What I'm trying to say is THAT'S why she cheated, because she was probably a shit girlfriend. \n\nGo through your post, and replace \"I found her videos\" with \"I found her cheating\" and the rest of the relationship suddenly sounds like exactly the kind of relationship you get when you take someone back after they cheat. \n\nAnd for anyone else who comes across this massive red flag, absolutely fucking run from that shit if you ever encounter it. Anyone who does that is a shitty relationship partner to their core. Don't make the same mistake as us and stick around for two more years to figure out the exact flavor of shit they are.",

There had to be reflection on both parties because that\u2019s the adult way to move forward, right?\n\nThey don\u2019t keep sex tapes with their exes, and I\u2019m not saying she was in the right with that by any means.\n\nAnd feeling uncomfortable and suspicious is definitely valid, but continuing to be suspicious after a couple years with no major good reason to be isn\u2019t. If I\u2019m still suspicious after a couple years, why am I sticking around? I\u2019m ultimately just keeping the both of us trapped in a toxic relationship, as was she by not also ending things after a duration of the toxicity my endless suspicious attitude brought to the table.\n\nThe relationship ended because regardless of A, B, or C reason it collapsed beyond recovery, or a delusion it could be recovered - it ended because it really needed to.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to get over it, totally agree. I\u2019m a big advocate for the idea that you don\u2019t have to forgive people who hurt you. But if you\u2019re going to stay in the relationship, you need to find a way to get over it, and forgive them, otherwise you\u2019re being unfair to both parties. You\u2019re not allowing them a chance to properly grow from their mistakes and bad decisions, and you\u2019re not allowing yourself the opportunity of real happiness with someone you feel safe and comfortable with.\n\nSo, I said in another comment that I empathize with people in toxic or abusive relationships who cheat, because it often comes from a place of desperation to feel safe and happy with someone when you fail to feel that way with your partner.\n\nI often put it like this: if you have a couple in a relationship, one party is abusive and/or controlling, whether it\u2019s mentally, emotionally, psychologically, and of course physically and sexually. The party being abused ends up cheating with someone else. Whether the latter person got caught or not, who is the bigger asshole in the situation? Sometimes it bothers me when people say it\u2019s the cheater who was ultimately in the wrong, or somehow equates the two as being equally bad. They aren\u2019t. \n\nAs the person who actually knows my partner, I can whole heartedly say they are not genuinely a piece of shit. We\u2019re friends. She\u2019s married, and seemingly (hopefully) happier and in a better place. Quite frankly we\u2019re both much happier. It happened a long time ago. I don\u2019t imagine keeping sex content from exes is a thing she does anymore, and as far as I know she hasn\u2019t cheated on her husband. We\u2019ve forgiven each other. The most I can do from there is self reflect to become a better person. Being controlling and abusive in that aspect was wrong of me.\n\nThe bigger point, which is something I also highly advocate for, is to know and accept when the horse is dead, don\u2019t waste your time trying to revive trust that can\u2019t be repaired. For some folks it can be, for others it can\u2019t, and too many people have a hard time accepting the latter - in both parties of a relationship, sometimes at the same time. That\u2019s the ticket.",

When someone sends you nudes, pics or videos, you don't \"own\" them, maybe if it's just some random person, that likes showing themself for others, like people who are into exibicionism, but when someone you're dating sends you nudes it's something intimate and personnal. Now, just for starters, it's unhealthy for you if you keep those pictures, as it obviously means you've not moved on from that relationship, but that aside, that girl from 2 years ago has probably moved on with her life, and someone having her nudes from 2 years ago could be unconfortable to her, to say the least. Heck, I've sent nudes to people I dated years ago, and I would definitely feel unconfortable if I knew they still hold on to those. BUT, we don't have much context, I can definetly see this being okay during the right circunstances, but since we don't know, it's safe to assume that he shouldn't have those anymore, and he probably knew this. I think bottom line is, it's one of those things that aren't exactly \"wrong\", but very frowned upon, and yeah, kind of creepy tbh...  \nSorry for the long text btw",

For example, if you're single, and masturbating to some memories of past relationship/s, I think that's cool, whatever, but say you're having sex with your current S.O., and you're thinking of and ex... Yeah, kind of fucked up tbh",

There\u2019s clearly a difference and it\u2019s on the emotional level. He could get off to his ex because it was fulfilling an emotional need, but he\u2019s in a relationship with someone else, who clearly isn\u2019t fulfilling that emotional need, or at least now believes that she isn\u2019t (there\u2019s a reason he went to nudes of his ex and not his current girlfriend right?). \n\nJerking it is just dealing with a physical need, it\u2019s not cheating and it\u2019s not your partner not being enough - she wasn\u2019t even in the house. Jerking it to your personal hall of fame definitely implies his current partner is enough because he needs more than physical/visceral stimulation to get the job done. \n\nHe\u2019s clearly not over his ex and that always causes problems in current relationships. ALWAYS. \n\nDoes this make things a bit clearer? (Also, no downvote from me, it\u2019s a fair question, if a touch naive).",

Under that logic there should be no personal property.  No-one should keep guns, porn, medications,... because of the risk it can accidently get out.

It isn't the same as using your imagination at all, and no I can promise that I've NEVER thought of an ex while masterbating, as a matter of fact I've never thought of anyone while masterbating, I clear my mind and focus on what I'm feeling right then and there. Not to say it's weird or wrong to think of a previous sexual encounter while masterbating at all, but HAVING to watch or look at videos of your ex in order to finish, especially while in a relationship with someone else is extremely morally incorrect",

It's decent to get rid of pics like that, but it's not really a problem unless you can't move on because of the access.\n\n>Have you ever jacked off thinking about a previous time you had sex? It's normal.\n\nIf you're cry-wanking it's unhealthy, and if you're with an exclusive partner it's morally wrong you're watching too much porn if you can't have your partner be your \"go-to\".\n\n>Going further are we never allowed to reminisce about good moments?\n\nIt's one thing to think back on the good times, and another to get off to your ex when you have an exclusive partner. Most people (that I know- anecdotal evidence) don't like hearing about their partner's exes and definitely don't like hearing about how fun they were to be around, especially not how awesome they were to fuck. I don't think it's wrong to reminisce on the good times, but the main issue is lingering will and want for the ex, and not actually being ready for a new partner. No one's perfect sometimes people will think back and get upset about their breakups, but the context here is wildly different.\n\nI'm gonna assume you're a guy, put yourself in her shoes for a moment and imagine a shitty scenario-\n\nYou find your girlfriend, your long-term exclusive partner, looking at porn. Not just any porn it's her ex and his massive cock and balls, mayhap it's bigger than yours, or you're a little insecure and think maybe his is more aesthetically pleasing. She's clearly using the material and not just looking at it. How would you feel about this?\n\nNow to go a bit further because of the \"reminiscing\" part, and because I think different scenarios aren't equal for both sides- for example the mere suggestion may upset a woman but would be funny to a guy.\n\n Imagine you're fucking your girlfriend, she maybe looks a little bored and just drops \"my ex's dick was better.\" Wouldn't you be upset?",

If that's the situation, sure I agree, but I don't know if it is.\n\n>>Going further are we never allowed to reminisce about good moments?\n>\n>It's one thing to think back on the good times, and another to get off to your ex when you have an exclusive partner.\n\nI disagree. Maybe if you're young sure but as you get older its more and more normal, and your good given right to imagine yourself with that girl fucking by the beach and get turned on by it.  I know your current partner doesn't want to hear it, but as long you're treating each other well and having sex together, she's got no right to deny me that.  Life is beautiful and there were awesome moments, sometimes with exes and no-one has a right to take that away because of their insecurities (even totally understandable insecurities)\n\n> Most people (that I know- anecdotal evidence) don't like hearing about their partner's exes and definitely don't like hearing about how fun they were to be around, especially not how awesome they were to fuck\n\nSure. And that's normal to feel that way and you deserve consideration.  But that doesn't give you cart blanche to take away bits of someone's past.",

I then countered that he may have instead been getting off because it was a piece of porn that was made for him, and only he had possession of.\n\nI didn't draw a conclusion about OP either way. I only criticised others for drawing conclusions without even attempting to consider other, opposing ideas.\n____\nIf you think of something and it feels like it clicks, the very next thing you should do is try to disprove it. You shouldn't just go around trying to make it click with other people and then blindly assure yourselves that your idea was valid because lots of people agree that it clicks. You must be critical of your ideas in order to find objective truth.\n\nEdit: lol instant downvote within seconds of this comment. I'm sure you considered my point before you clicked.",

He has to keep this porn around as it's his finishing move and it leads to this kind of scenario.\n\nSecondly it's more likely the reason he's getting off is because he's not \"supposed\" to be getting off on it. It's extra \"naughty\" because if he gets caught with it he's in trouble and also, he probably shouldn't still have it anyways from the ex's viewpoint, not that I'm going to judge him too much about that.\n\nHe shouldn't still be using porn of his ex as what seems like a pivotal crutch to orgasm.  It doesn't seem healthy for his *current relationship*.\n\nI don't give a single solitary fuck if he's single and whacking off to his ex, or being in his current relationship and having the occasional or semi-regular wank over the \"memories\" of his ex.\n\nJust don't think needing actual porn of his ex to push him over the line is healthy. I'm not saying he's a bad person or committing some kind of depraved sin, just that his relationship would probably (and provably now) be healthier without it.",

Whether this behaviour affects the viability of their relationship either positively or negatively is between them, but where I took issue is when it starts to be suggested there is something inherently unhealthy or abnormal in a given person being sexually aroused by prior sexual encounters.\n\n> it's more likely the reason he's getting off is because he's not \"supposed\" to be getting off on it. It's extra \"naughty\" \n\nI doubt anybody in this sub is trained to make such a diagnosis, but even if this is accurate, again it has no impact or worth outside it\u2019s ability to impact the current relationship. What is so crucial about the (imo) superficial distinction between digital images of his ex compared to memories he reflected on in his mind? I am sure we can agree OPs girlfriend would be no less shocked or wounded if he called out his ex\u2019s name while engaged in sexual activity with her than him look ing at naked pictures while alone. I think the over-inflated importance of \u201cohmygod he looked at his ex\u2019s image!\u201d is largely childish and irrelevant once you dismiss the novelty of the circumstance.  \n\n> He shouldn't still be using porn of his ex as what seems like a pivotal crutch to orgasm. \n\nBear in mind all this occured when OP was alone (to his knowledge), it\u2019s not like he was engaged in sexual activity with his current partner and wallpapering over her identity. I don\u2019t think its fair to overly pass judgement on the exact bent of a persons masterbation material or aid. If I married an Asian woman, am I only supposed to look at Asian pornography to be \u201chealthy\u201d? I think the novelty of the kink is largely irrelevant.  \n\nThe real issue for OP is that he seems to be romantically interested in one person but still sexually attracted to certain physicalities or behaviours of another. That happens in life. I dont think he should be judged or demonised for it, anymore than he would for being attracted solely to the personality or behaviour of the person he\u2019s currently with. In an ideal world he\u2019d be able to have a relationship with an individual or individuals that possessed all these attributes, but it is what it is, life is about compromise. Maybe one day he will form memories or have images with his current partner which supplant those currently at the top of his preference list. In the mean time I don\u2019t think being turned on by someone you used to have sex with is any more radical or deplorable than the thousands of legitimised porn categories people explore and enjoy everyday",

A fair reading would assume it related to how it could affect his relationship.. Whatever else it could be? I don't believe in sin or any kind of intrinsic harm to this stuff so the only real problem is how anything would manifest in his relationships.\n\nI couldn't possibly have meant there is anything inherently abnormal or unhealthy about being sexually aroused by prior relationships because I find it absurd someone could believe that.\n\nAs with pretty much anything in any facet of life, something is only considered a unhealthy *if it's interfering in your actual life*. Look at masturbation itself. Perfectly normal, everyone should do it, but when it starts affecting your life because you're doing it ten times a day, in office toilets on trains etc then it's unhealthy.\n\nSame thing with this. I very, very specifically mentioned that he wasn't able to get off on porn and needed his special blanky porn to tip him over the edge which he called his \"go to\". Forty minutes dude. and he was *frustrated*. Dude was frustrated he can't blow in 40 minutes of porn, porn I assume he has selected based on it catering to his specific interests.\n\nDoes that sound healthy? To be *frustrated* after 40 minutes of porn that caters to him until he brings the pictures he probably shouldn't have out?\n\nTHAT is what I was judging.\n\nI can't even conceptualize the issue you think I had. Maybe don't see individuals on Reddit as every dipshit you've ever seen on Reddit and imbue them with the worst possible takes. I'm a grown ass man with a wife and kids that face palms at half the sexual thought policing I see here.\n\nThis is different, because it can effect his relationship. And the difference between having videos and picturing it in his mind is the act of *keeping* the media. I would put it in the same class of a girl keeping love letters from her ex in a shoe box in the closet or something. There is a difference in *not letting go* of the past and letting it be the past. It would be *unhealthy* if she had to open the shoe box once a week to get her romance rocks off because The Notebook wasn't getting her there and the danger of her new partner finding them.",

Given the many similar comments in the surrounding discussion that could be taken to mean unhealthy behaviour for him psychologically, emotionally or maybe some form of sexual dysfunction etc, the list goes on. You should have been clearer with the aspect you were indicating. \n\n> I couldn't possibly have meant there is anything inherently abnormal..\n\nAgain, your comment is floating in a sea of many similar judgments with some suggesting exactly that. There\u2019s a wide spectrum of opinions so let\u2019s avoid overly broad statements.  \n\n> he can't blow in 40 minutes of porn, [...] Does that sound healthy?\n\nTbh you\u2019re contradicting your own prior comment here. Now you *do* think there is intrinsically unhealthy behaviour or psychology to the individual. Not just constrained to the impact on the relationship? I can\u2019t tell. Leaving that confusion aside, I don\u2019t think a one off episode gives us enough to condemn OP as some kind of sexually dysfunctional individual. What would we say if he climaxed in 4 seconds? That would be healthier? What if he was just having an off day? It doesn\u2019t say the ex videos worked in this situation either, so what do we label as the unhealthy agent now? We\u2019re saying OP is unhealthy because one day he couldn\u2019t masturbate to climax? Seems to me he went back to an aid that worked before, bfd. Does the fact he had experienced a prior interaction with the person in the material make it somehow more deleterious? If you or I had a favourite pornstar, then slept with them and then separated, would we be forever banned from looking at any of their videos in the future?\n\n> The difference is the act of keeping the media.\n\nI personally don\u2019t see any inherent flaw or dysfunction in employing the phenomenon of nostalgia. Everybody has a past and I didn\u2019t think it\u2019s any more mature to need to physically delete materials you possess than it is to accept them as a part of your journey through life. Is my partner supposed to burn her first ever valentines cards or cut out the face of the guy who took her to her first school dance? What about enjoying dancing to music of our youth or only laughing at comedies we\u2019ve seen a million times? Time is a very strange phenomenon and nostalgia is a very evocative emotion. I think people are just drawing a special boundary around this because it involved sex. Yes things from the past can be abused and over-indulged in, no different from things in the present, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s mandatory or required to wholesale delete entire chapters from ones own the past. Sucks he got caught with his pants down but if the prior partner left him very sexually fulfilled (with or without visual evidence) then it is what it is. \n\nTldr: if I slept with Rihanna and she sent me a video of the event, I\u2019d be going to the grave with it still on my hard drive.

He should have deleted that shit before he got involved with his gf. \n\nMy ex didn't do this to me but early on in the relationship he started comparing me to other women he saw out in public. It really insulted me and made me angry. He would see a nicely toned woman on a motorcycle (we both rode Harleys) and tell me how much he liked her body. He said he would 'do' her. As if he ever had a chance. I am not one to hold back my feelings and I told him how his comments angered me. It took him a while to stop saying things out loud and by then I was over his shit. \n\nAfter we split up and moved on I saw on Facebook that my ex had moved in with a woman who does *not* have a toned body nor does she ride a motorcycle. They stayed together for a couple of years then she moved on. My ex then got into yet another relationship with a woman who has her own motorcycle and she is larger than my ex. She is certainly not toned nor thin. In fact, her legs look like two thick tree trunks. Not only that, she looks like one of my sisters except this woman is losing her hair and dyes the rest. It doesn't bother me that my ex has a girlfriend and it wouldn't bother me if he had a boyfriend either. I just think it's ironic that for so long, my ex insulted me by comparing me to athletic-looking women and then he's with a woman who looks like she could squash him just by sitting on him.",

You decide during your relatinoship whether something is cheating or not cheating and you set those boundaries within the dynamic of your relationship.   \n\n\nAlso, cheating is not the only big sin you can do in a relationship and you can break someone's trust in a myriad of ways that aren't related to cheating on them. We are biologically wired to respond more to anxiety and suspicion than we are to comfort and trust, we naturally lean towards being anxious and suspicious. Once given a reason to do that, it's very difficult to move away from it. It's one of the core functions of PTSD, actually, and why recovery is so difficult, because according to your brain you have every right to relive the moments that gave you PTSD, you \"need\" to remember, or it may happen to you. These mechanisms were designed to save our lives over the millions of years of evolution that got us here.",

Just polar extremes.. Sometimes it's just none of our business what goes on between a couple, ex or not. Some people do not like porn. Some, like you, don't care if an ex keeps old photos you sent. Some do. I'm not going to cast a stone either way on that. \n\nThat being said, ouch to OP, that was really dumb, and it does say something that you are still doing that to an ex of 2 years while in your current relationship. Ofc that's going to be seen as a confidence deflater, at the least worst of it, but it's not hard to see that as a continued attraction to an ex in comparison to your current gf. I do find it hilarious how people have no problem masturbating to porn, as opposed to a naked woman you knew, yet I get the overall idea that there's a difference between masturbating to someone you're never, ever going to get with as compared to someone you have had fun times with, etc. \n\nLike no one here has ever thought back to a hot, passionate moment they had with an ex or a fling and did the self-deed... I'm not sure what the line is for mature/immature here, and how much is projecting fears this means someone is going to cheat/go back to a person in the past. I think it's a bit emotional insecurity as well that causes these fears, because if your s.o. can masturbate to porn/erotica without issue and you not feel insecure, undesired, I'm not sure I can understand completely why they could not do it this way if the relationship was already on solid ground. Not everyone in a relationship are horny at the same time, nor available at the same time to fool around. If you say to masturbate to the current gf, which is equally fine regardless, but I've had the conversation with others who have said that's weird. Where's the line?",

Personally I draw the line at my partner getting off (privately at least) to people they can actually chat with - keep it to porn sites where it\u2019s less personal. I, also personally, wouldn\u2019t love it if I walked in to the situation the OP created - but on the flip side I also don\u2019t care if my ex\u2019s kept our private photos/things I sent them because I consider them gifts I gave. Tokens of appreciation and happiness in our relationship if that makes sense? I also know that my previous partners wouldn\u2019t be malicious with them so that helps as well. \n\nBottom line is that it really comes down to communicating what your limits are in your relationship and making sure each person knows and accepts the others boundaries. Mine are just more relaxed than a lot of people in this thread and that\u2019s fine - to each their own. I shouldn\u2019t have phrased it as a a \u201cweird hang-up\u201d and instead went into more detail like I did above\u2026 pitfalls of me having had less time to make my comment earlier.",

Whilst you can be comfortable with someone having access to those things when you're in a relationship it's not always the case afterwards. That's why social consensus is to delete them, especially when in a new relationship. \n\nAnd wrt other media, I know my friends will remove all pics of their exes from social media if they break up and from their devices. Why would you want to hold on to that stuff when in a new relationship? \n\nBut wether that's a social consensus thing or not idk, that's just my experience.\n\neta: I definitely think there should be at least a spoken agreement when a relationship ends on what happens to any explicit content shared between people.

We were scrolling through his gallery looking at the silly photos his sister and her best friend made using the laptop (think tons of filters and emojis on pictures) then BOOM pictures of his ex. Provocative. Topless. I was speechless. He told me that they were really old (think 1 year? not sure how long they were together tbh) and that he is so sorry and he will delete them (not sure if he did). We were early 20s, still living with our parents.\n\nI visited unannounced a few days later to speak to him, see an unfamiliar car there. He comes to greet me and is annoyed that I arrived unannounced. I asked whose car it was, he says it is her car... I refused to go inside, he goes inside, she comes out and leaves saying \"sorry\" to me... He tells me he still had some feelings for her as she was his first love, that she comes from a shitty home and will always care for her etc. and tells me that they still hang out often since she lives close and she comes to his house because it is her safe haven and she likes to smoke and her parents didn't allow her??? And that she and his mother get along so well so they often have tea together? I had NO idea that they hung out and at this point we had been together for a few months, he hid this so well. (Edit: I felt so fucking stupid for a while after...)\n\nThis was one of the contributing factors to our break up. At this point the relationship was so strained, this kind of snapped everything.",

Fast forward a bit into my 20's, I'm dating this girl, I'm really liking her. She had a kid who's under 2 from another dude but I'm starting to get feelings for the kid to because I'm around him so much. I finally tell her I loved her and meant it and it was a big deal for me.\n\nCouple months later on her birthday she drank a little too much so I slept on her bed with her son and she slept on the couch. Her phone received a text, it was from a random guy who she met online from the military with plans to meet in another town and have sex. The texts were super graphic, I sexual positions, what they wanted to do to each other, even anal. I was so broken, the first girl I had truly fallen in love with, stabbed me in the fuckin heart. I woke her up from her drunken sleep and told her to sober up and watch her fuckin kid and dipped out.\n\nOf course she turned things around on me like most cheaters do. I shouldn't have gone through her phone, etc.\n\nThat fucked me up for a long time. Could trust anyone. And had super unhealthy relationships for a long time. The longest relationship I've had after that was a controller for the company I was a manager for. She had a husband and 2 kids. I'm not proud of it and won't justify it but I was really broken inside.",

We may think about exes once in a while (honestly, I never did, but you get it), but if you constantly masturbate to mental fantasies of your ex, it's still super fucked up. There is just less evidence. \n\n\nThe reason it's bad is because you are emotionally cheating on your partner, even if you aren't physically cheating - yet. But the emotional and physical desire for that other person remains, and you are constantly thinking about it - and that means you are not really committed to your current partner. \n\n\nKeeping nudes is disrespectful because it is a violation of the person's autonomy in a way, unless they said they're cool with you keeping them. Just like rescinding consent to their body in real life, they have rescinded consent to their body in pictures and videos too. Breaking up implicitly means, \"I no longer want you to have access to my body to pleasure yourself.\" Or think of it this way:\n\n\n Imagine a guy who had bullied you (or who you otherwise disliked - or who was your dad's age) had your nudes and dick pics and jacked off to them multiple times a week. Would it make you feel great? Or gross? You could argue, \"What's the harm, if you didn't know about it that wouldn't even affect you!\" Which may be sort of true, but doesn't make you FEEL any better about it once you know. An ex, who you presumably do not like anymore, having your naked form stored and masturbating to it is just...gross for the same reason.\n\nEdit: and finally... if your girlfriend was masturbating to her ex-boyfriend's dick pics and videos while she was dating you, and kept copies of them on her phone for years after breaking up with them...would you think that was fine? Would you feel secure in your relationship, knowing that when it came time for self pleasure, YOU weren't the one she wanted?",

Emotional attachment matters more than the physical act here. The fact that you have to think about someone else to get off is actually pretty bad. It means you have greater attachment with that person than your actual partner. Think of it this way, from your partner's perspective, they now have all the reason to believe that you would leave them to get together with that person in your fantasies, if given the chance. With that thought in mind, they won't be with you for long, unless they also see the relationship as a compromise, and rather be with another person that they think of while masturbating or having sex.

Yes they were a gift, but they were a gift given in the context of a relationship. That context doesn't exist any more, so in my opinion the photos should not exist. But, if your ex gives **explicit consent** that you can keep them, then it's fine. \n\n\nAll of that gets thrown out the window when you get in a new relationship. Then they should be deleted. Unless you get the okay from your current partner to keep them. Then it's fine.",

I can think of like 5 times total I even talked about pedos, in which I called pedos disgusting and argued that loli art should be illegal 4/5 times, and the final being the aforementioned argument.\n\nAn argument mind you, which initially had nothing to do with children or pedos, but in which someone called me a pedo just like this, citing my comment in which I essentially said \u201cpedos are disgusting, but unfortunately getting off to loli art isn\u2019t usually illegal most places, even though it should be.\u201d \n\nSo seriously, what was it, what have I been posting?

When I was young and unmarried we actually used to meet up in person and have sex. We didn't do it over the phone.\n\nMaybe that's why I think it's strange that you want to give people naked photos of yourself and expect people to protect you from your own stupidity and lack of foresight. I get that this really upsets you people, but I don't give a shit. You're fucking idiots to do it and expect some universal code of morality to protect you from the consequences.\n\nOn the other hand, one of my old flames from university does have some rather racy letters from me when we were separated for the holidays and exchanging passionate correspondence. Perhaps I should phone her and check that she doesn't occasionally re-read them and get herself off remembering the past?",

You can consent to something once and then not consent to the same thing another time. Like sex, for example. You can revoke consent to an ongoing arrangement, like if you are loaning the nude to someone. But you can't 'revoke consent' to a gift you have given someone. It doesn't work like that.\n\nI know you think the whole world should be arranged so as to fix any poor decisions you make in life, but it isn't. If you give something to someone, you cannot just  a magic wand and say 'I revoke consent' at some later date.\n\nIf I give a picture of my dick to a girlfriend, and after we break up she decides to show it to some friends of mine for a laugh, it's shit - but it's my fuck up. I can't just say 'I don't consent anymore' and expect everyone to change the way things work because I fucked up.\n\nSharing photos of someone is a shit move. Keeping photos you know an ex wouldn't want you to have is a shit move. But stop trying to make out like there's any sort of legal 'consent' issue.",

Sharing images/videos of an ex is enough to land you some pretty harsh penalties. (and so it should be).\n\nNot to mention that, forgetting the legality, it's scumbag behaviour and morally wrong. If your ex gf shared pics of your dick (for a laugh, lol) then she fucked up. Not you.

You can justifiably comment that it's irresponsible of the homeowner but at the end of the day - the robber is the one committing the crime and being a scumbag. Same deal here.",

If she actually published them on the internet, that would be a different story. \n3. Victim blaming. Not quite. If someone publishes revenge porn, I have no problem with that being a crime. But I do have a problem with the idea that the police should go round retrieving photos of yourself you have been stupid enough to give to someone. So if you think that expecting grown adults to live with the consequences of their own stupidity is 'victim blaming', then fine. \n4. Suggest what you like.\n5. You call me moronic and then liken GIVING photos of yourself to someone to leaving your door unlocked and being burgled? How twisted does your view of reality have to be to think they are equatable?\n\nIn your analogy, it would be more like inviting someone into your home and giving them your copy of Sgt Pepper. Then being upset years later, after you've stopped being friends, about the fact that they occasionally get it out and listen to it. And then, when someone says maybe don't give stuff to people if you don't ever want them to use it, saying they are 'victim blaming'.\n\nIf you break up with someone and keep their nudes, that's shitty behaviour.

A nude is not a gift freely given with the intent of you using it however you want to. You don't treat it like a regular gift. Regifting it or framing it on the wall or whatever you'd do is not something you'd do with a nude, because it would be violating the senders privacy and trust.\n\nIt is because of that privacy and trust that the \"consent\", in this case your owning of and enjoying the nude, can be revoked. Same thing as just because someone let you see them naked once doesn't mean you always have the right to see them naked just because you can. It's a reasonable expectation of bodily autonomy and privacy, that extends to pictures, and the law reflects that, because that is how a majority of people interpret it morally. Ie, the reason why revenge porn is illegal.\n\nSo in your example, if you give a nude to your girlfriend, or she takes a picture of you naked, then no, she does not have the right to do whatever she wants with that picture, because it's your body and you have a say about what happens to your privacy.\n\nOf course, we don't live in a perfect world where people respect each other's privacy or rights. But just because some people break in to cars, for example, just because it happens doesn't mean it's ok. Just because some people share nudes or keep them when the sender want them gone, doesn't make it ok.",

There is no contextual change involved, the very act of doing a sex scene for a movie is accepting that there are people who will jerk to it.\n\nThat was the moment they consented, but if the context changes, you need consent under the new context. Similar to how consenting to sex with someone using a condom is not consenting to sex without a condom. If someone gives nudes to their boyfriend consenting for their boyfriend wanking to it, the context is changed after that relationship ends. The consent to a bf having nudes is not necessarily consent for an ex having nudes.",

Let her know you understand if she couldn't go on any longer being with you because what you did was disgusting and reprehensible. Ask how you can help get out of her way as fast and painlessly a possible because she does not deserve someone like you in her life right now.

Likely, she will never feel like enough, she will always feel like you find your ex more attractive than her, and she will always feel insecure that you're thinking about your ex all the time. I don't want an actual answer, I just want you to think about it, why didn't you get rid of them in the first place? And then to actively seek them out from a place of selfishness, that's kinda fucked up. It'd be different if you were single, but that's beyond disrespectful to your current girlfriend. Don't be in an exclusive relationship if you don't have the maturity or are not ready to let go of your ex. My thoughts go out to the poor girl, I can only imagine how hurt she feels.",

I've definitely got at least one or two videos from my younger days that still \"do the job\" if I need a little help.

I'm not going to tell my gf about it, but that's not because I'm hiding it.

Like maybe the grass is actually greener on the other side with this new girl and she's actually amazing. It doesn't mean I'm not awesome, it just means she's awesome too and my ex's just a fucking dick. But someone old is just like, \"Wow you had both of us and you chose her after telling me how ass she was to you. That just makes me feel like I'm worse than trash.\" \n\nAlso with someone new, if you do get back together, you know that the chances for the cheating to happen again is less than if they cheated with someone old. There's no button to push like with someone old. There's obviously other new people for them to cheat on you with, but they're going to have to try harder than if an ex just called them up and said \"I miss you\" or some shit like that.",

Shame you get attacked for not conforming to the romantic disney ideal that everyone thinks they are too intelligent and mature to believe in, but actually does.\n\nProbably 99.9% of women have, at one point or another, thought about an ex while with their current partner. It doesn't mean the relationship is broken. \n\nMost of the people on here complaining about this are 20-somethings who haven't been in a relationship long enough for them to figure out that sex and romance are not the key factors in a successful long term relationship. \n\nMutual respect, laughter, consideration and sharing, having each other's back,  enjoying each other's company, and being able to accept that your partner doesn't think you are the pinnacle of human sexiness, and being ok with it - that's a relationship which will last. Expecting your boyfriend to have eyes only for you and never want to beat off to someone else for a dirty 5 minutes - nah. That's not going to endure the reality of life for long.",

On the grand scale of things, it's pretty minor. If the worst your husband / partner ever did was wank over an ex's photo, you should count yourself pretty blessed. When you've been married for 20 years and seen the reasons your friends and loved ones got divorced, you'd have some perspective on this.",

I only found out because pretty soon after he moved in with me, he used my computer (he didn't have one) to log into Google and downloaded them. I didn't even have to look, the stuff was right there in the download folder. I saw it when I went to install a game he mentioned he liked. \n\nWe had a fight, then he claimed he deleted them, but I saw I had a new Google login saved. Decided screw it, he's already lied once, let's see what this account is about. He didn't delete anything.  He just forwarded those files to the new email account but forgot to remove the traces to that account. \n\n I think giving someone your passwords after a major mess up causes way more bad than good. It feels like OP is putting the healing all on his girlfriend's shoulders without doing any actual work on his part to make his GF feel loved. Giving someone your log ins doesn't work. OP will eventually feel resentful that she doesn't trust him and will get mad if she wants to continue to look even though he's the one that messed up. \n\nThrow the whole relationship away. She deserves someone better. I wish I walked away before I went through hell and ruined my confidence with that dude. \n\nYou've already shown who you care about more, and its not your current GF. Do right by her and let her go. You need to work on yourself and figure out why you can't get off by yourself without pictures of your ex.",

If you had videos of your ex bf, those would probably mean something to you and you might not be able to separate the physical desire from the emotional. We can. You would get rid of the videos because they're sentimental. That's not always true for us. We have sentimental attachment to some girls, but we also have the animal part of our brain that just wants visual stimulation. If I had a porn video of my ex, I would be able to jerk off to it without it meaning anything whatsoever. I could turn it off afterwards and go about my life, never again thinking about it. You might not be able to do that. \n\nWe're wired differently. Guys instinctually want women they've never had. I'm happily married with kids. Been married 6 years. Never cheated, never would. I don't miss any of my ex's. My wife is sexy and incredible, total package. But every day when I see an attractive woman, my brain says \"look at that girl...\" It's how we're designed. Evolution selected for that. If you understand our biology, it'll be easier to see it for what it is: he made a dumb move. It wasn't malicious. It doesn't mean his girl isn't enough. It doesn't mean his ex is more attractive. It just means he gave his animal brain a little too much leash. He should be held accountable, but it would be stupid to end a relationship over that. \n\nTo be fair, it goes both ways. He has to understand that she feels differently about it than he does. He'll need to reassure her and make up for the mistake.",

Maybe It'll help me understand her needs better and I can give her some amazing sex or nudes.\n\nI don't get why is everyone so upset? In my relationships I've kinda been alternating between great sex and great outside of bedroom. Currently in the \"great outside of bedroom\" relationship and I can totally understand why after 40min of frustration OP would switch to \"the best porn I have\" in order to speed up things. For me not only is this better porn than most online stuff but also has some very sexy memories. It's just porn, geez.\n\nSo do I wish I could have S tier sex with my current GF? Sure. Doesn't mean that I'm hung up on my ex or that I'm gonna dump her. And trust me, I've been SERIOUSLY hung up on my ex before, that ain't it.\n\nShe's within her rights to ask him to delete them I suppose. I just hope that she isn't insecure enough to dump him over this. She probably will sooner or later, but... I hope she can move on. That'd be the dumbest reason for breakup I've ever heard. Fingers crossed for you OP.\n\nAlso 40min is kinda long, but I don't think it's a  reason to jump to a conclusion that OP needs help. It happens sometimes. Especially on some drugs like antidepressants.",

              "text": "The interesting there, not going into the right or wrong of the situation for OP, is so many people are admitting that it would be an insecurity issue for them, without actually saying it. To them it means they're not good enough, not seen the same and so their trust is violated, because they see it as cheating (debatable, I think context would be key). That is being insecure with who you are in the relationship, especially if there were no issues in the relationship aside from this incident (I am assuming there are other issues at home OP has not mentioned, plus as people mentioned about the headphone thing, etc being a bit sus in the desire to get caught). \n\nIf you are confident about your relationship, about yourself, then I'm not sure this should be considered a red flag - I don't see it as necessarily a deal breaker depending on how the comfortable the couple is in their relationship and themselves. However, I get, too, how the insecurity issues of it could conflate with trust issues to poison the well, and thus become a relationship-ending affair, also known as a self-fulfilling prophecy, which happened to one of the other commenters on here. The question of consent regarding old photos from the POV of the ex is a great point, as others have pointed out, but if the exes consented to them keeping them, then I do feel that's another story, and some people here are maybe not being the most sex positive with their rhetoric in that case as well.",

As if because she enjoyed it with a partner(s) in an agreed setting , she would also enjoy it without agreeing to be part of it in the first place.",

And that \"property\" involves explicit images of another person. Not sex, per se, but still sexual in nature. mean, by your logic, that would mean revenge porn can be seen as ethical. It's their property, so you can't tell them what to do with it, right? It's theirs, so they can distribute it. \nAlso, you're missing one part of my original comment - that he assumed the ex would be okay with it because she had a humiliation kink. Just because she consented to it when they were a couple does not mean she would immediately be okay with it with whoever and whenever. It's not up to OP to decide. \nMaybe the line between what's okay or not okay to do can be blurry, but consent is not a one time thing",

Why did you still have those videos or pictures?? It's not like this is a brand new relationship. You've been with her for \"almost 2 years\" and it never crossed your mind how fucked up it is you kept them? I feel awful for your soon to be ex girlfriend. I can promise you, this will be that one thing she goes back to any time she's upset and it will break down your relationship. May not be today, may not even be a few months from now, but I can see exactly where this is going. It's not fair that now you've broken her trust and anytime you pick up your phone or leave the house without her, guess what she's going to be doing? Questioning who, what, when, where, why. How would you feel if the roles were reversed? If she does forgive you, I hope you learn to value her a hell of a lot more than you do now, because you don't deserve it.\n\nNow with that said, it is what it is. Roll with the punches, don't make stupid ass excuses. And whatever you do, DON'T DO THAT AGAIN.\n\nEdit: Word",

Clearly you still really wanted to be with her if you were still holding on to that kind of material for that long, but it seems like you just didn\u2019t want to put in the effort to move, but then again I don\u2019t know anything about your past relationship so it\u2019s just how it seems to me. If you hadn\u2019t been in the relationship for long, I could understand some uneasiness about moving, but you definitely should have lost that material right after the relationship was over. I\u2019m not sure how you were able to convince your current girlfriend that you were committed. If you thought you were committed to her then you may have been lying to yourself. This is just my perspective so you may take it or leave it, but I think you definitely need to closely examine your behavior because it\u2019s not healthy",

Hell, I got trust issues just reading this. I don\u2019t mean this to be malicious, but I truly think this fuck up means your relationship will never be fixed. Even if she says she\u2019s fine, she won\u2019t be. She\u2019ll be wracked with anxiety every time she thinks about sex with you. \nAnd this is not a singular fuck up. You\u2019ve been doing this for months and the \u201cfuck up\u201d came when your girlfriend came home and found out. That means you\u2019d still be doing it right now if she didn\u2019t know and THATS fucked up. You didn\u2019t make a mistake, you spent years chipping away at a foundation of trust that just crumbled before your eyes. \n\nGood luck OP. Do better for your next girlfriend.",

Whether one thinks that is okay or not is up for anyone to decide for themselves, but let's not make it into more than what it is.\n\nThis notion of \"meant for the confines of the relationship\", while understandable on an emotional level, really has no realistic component. You can't take back the memories they have of you, so their ability to get sexual gratification with you in mind is not something you can ever impact - to then object to masturbation over sexual photos is just mincing semantics, when fact of the matter is that you can be an object of sexual desire for them regardless of whether there are photos or not and there's nothing you can do about it.\n\nIt also doesn't really work in any other scenario. You could make the same argument about birthday gifts for example - \"I only meant for you to have them because we were in a relationship; we're not anymore, so I want them back\". Nobody does this, and you don't really have any moral grounds to say that the other person is a douchebag if they don't comply either. A gift is a gift. If you don't like the idea of gifts being permanent, the wise thing to do is either get clarity on what the other person thinks about such things before you give them anything, or give them only things you're not going to want back (or not want them to have) if the relationship was to end.",

      "text": "Next time you need a wank to your ex-girlfriend's vids, go rent a cheap motel room with wifi and do your business. \n\nThen, get your best friend to impersonate a cop and tell your current girlfriend that you have been kidnapped and they are asking for ransom. \n\nThen, get the ransom money, use it to pay off the motel room in cash (so there is no trace).\n\nThen, use the rest of the money to hire a scary gangster to break your fapping arm so you can resist for a while. Give said individual your phone to make up for the rest of the payment. \n\nTHEN, show up at your girlfriend's parent's house on Christmas Eve to surprise her. She will be so relieved to see that you are alive but they are being evicted because they couldn't make the mortgage after using the house as collateral for your ransom. They are in the middle of moving to a shelter but you can't help because your arm is broken. \n\nSo, you just awkwardly linger while her elderly mother struggles with moving the coffee table by herself. You feel terrible that you have caused the family so much pain just for a quick tug. \n\nYou have a great idea; call the scary gangster from earlier in your scheme to come to help the family move (use the mom's phone; her hands are full). He shows up and is super helpful. He helps them all settled into the homeless shelter, where they now live.\n\nThe Gangster feels bad for her family and wants to help out because it is Christmas. \n\nIt turns out that the Gangster is actually Ryan Reynolds who was just researching a roll and happened to get roped into this whole clusterf%ck. Your girlfriend is star-struck. F\\*ING RYAN REYNOLDS!!! \n\nThey realize it's Christmas and they are standing under the mistletoe, (it's actually asbestos in the shelter). They make love on a cot, right in front of you. You are crushed. \n\nDefeated, you find your way back to your apartment; all alone on Christmas Eve.\n\nAfter pity drinking whiskey, you decided to Facebook message your ex-girlfriend, (what do you have to lose?) and tell her what happened. She says she feels awful about it...especially because you can't jack off anymore with the broken arm and Ryan Reynolds has your phone.\n\nShe offers to come over and keep you company for the evening....\n\nYou think, \"Finally, all this effort is going to pay off!\"\n\nHalf an hour later you hear a knock on the door so you rush to answer it for a night of debaucherous fun. \n\nSURPRISE!!! It's Ryan Reynolds and the police! Good guy Ry went through your phone and realized that you were hoarding revenge porn of underage girls so he called the authorities. \n\nNow you are in jail and you are everyone's \"ex-girlfriend\". \n\nHappy Holidays.",

You're 2 years into this relationship, which isn't an insignificant amount of time, but it also isn't something that she can't bounce back from. She will spend the rest of your relationship wondering if she was ever good enough. She will never get those images out of her head. It will now be almost impossible for you to rebuild trust because what you did was disgusting. Period. You've heard enough people in this thread tell you this but I think you need to make the jump on her behalf and just end her suffering. She may hang on to the relationship as a last ditch effort to save the connection with the person she loves - but you absolutely fucking wrecked your relationship. \n\nAnyways... You should also probably consider why those pictures were your GO TO for masturbating. You have admitted you literally could not cum without those photos and videos. That's... Kind of depraved.",

      "text": "I would recommend taking her side. Acknowledge your mistake. Tell her, as someone who cares so much about her feelings, she deserves far better and for that reason you believe you should remove yourself from her life. Tell her, you don't want to or ever want to risk hurt her ever again because her happiness matters more to you than anything else, even your happiness. A sacrifice here is the appropriate response to breaking her trust. How can she ever trust someone who has hurt her? A good start is by making a sacrifice. At the very least, you wish to continue to still be friends. That's not what you want but it's the right thing to do.\n\nShe'll be shocked that if you care so much, why would you jerk off to an ex? My response would be, when I'm horny I do dumb stuff. Also, it's easier to orgasm by fantasizing to women you've slept with (because it was real) than with someone you've never even met.  This is a reality that may be hard to swallow but I believe it to be true... through much practice. She very well be able to sympathize with that sentiment.\n\nBut no matter what, take her side. This may mean you break up but it's a stark possibility that you will anyway. Doing the right thing and calling off a relationship when you know it's not going to recover, at least not in it's previous form, is good for both parties. It will allow you both to recover sooner AND it's the right thing to do if you hurt someone so much you've broken their trust. You have to let them go. Godspeed!\n\nOr, ask her you need to update you gf porn.",

How in god's name does it hurt your exes if you jerk off to their pics without them knowing? If those pics and vids were taken with consent, there's no law against keeping them and nor should there be. If a relationship ends, you're not required to give back every gift the person has given you. That's delusional. \n\nIt's understandable that his current girlfriend got hurt by seeing him jerk off over those pics but for most guys it's most likely nothing more than just getting off. It doesn't mean they have feelings for an ex. It's way different than cheating. Physical sex involves an exchange of intimacy. A photo doesn't interact with you.

It's not fully like OP just sitting there watching porn for 40mins, but it's definitely less than when I wasn't dating my girlfriend.\n\n\nThat is exactly why I stopped watching porn over a year ago with maybe occasional relapses if my bf isn't around. It wasn't like it was all vanilla porn. I just started doing research and worried it escalating to more fetishises and then that not being enough. My use already increased more through the years.\n\nBut yup when I got in my current ltr my use dropped. And when I stopped my sex life improved immensely. I'm not going to be anti-porn here, but we need to admit it does affect our sex lives in different ways. I gave it up and my partner severely reduced his amount and things were remarkably different. Things were certainly less boring and more fun finding other ways to keep the magic alive than using other people in our minds for sex. That can backfire. Now porn is the boring one to me.\n\nAnd I will add: if some flirty connection sent you some nudes or whatever and there was no relationship or hookup that's different I suppose. But not an actual relationship. And it'd be respectful to not look at them during a relationship at least.",

Watching it and having difficulty getting off and needing to escalate is another. I consider being able to only get off by watching your ex videos that she and your current gf doesn't know you kept and watch escalating. Do you. Watch porn. But we need to stop pretending that all cases of it are okay and that endless watching is fine. \n\n\nBut this thread is the reason I am 100% against women sending nudes to anyone for any reason whatsoever. Especially knowing men defend keeping them. It is disgusting that someone would either a) keep them while in a relationship to get off, or b) turn my videos I sent in our relationship into just porn. Once a relationship ends the sexual consent stops. Nudes are very much part of the sexual component of the relationship. So it's an icky line he's crossing. So very gross in every single way.

But remember too, our brains will try to fool ourselves so honestly we can't always even trust our thoughts as we want to believe the best of ourselves. He may not be lying, but we make excuses for ourselves constantly.\n\n\n I also think you are seeing it from his eyes and me from his ex and his current gf eyes. In those things it truly can be hard to detemine a right or wrong, and that's when relationship boundaries and standards are set. Each of their boundaries and agreements would answer this. \n\nSo I will come back and look at this from all the sides.\n\nThe only factor missing is the ex girlfriend. That's the other layer. \n\nTo determine if this is right or wrong this would need to consider all 3 factors. His intentions, if this doesn't cross a boundary for his gf, and if his ex is okay with his use. Because what if she is not okay with her nudes and sex vids being used as porn? If she found out that could feel very violating.\n\nThat's why I feel that is more disrespectful than being sentimental. She didn't consent to be his porn fodder. She gave consent to those images while in the relationship not out. That's what makes it quite icky (to me).\n\nHonestly I'd love a poll to know how many people think keeping nudes and/or masturbating to them after a break up is okay. And I'd love it divided by the sexes. Then maybe people need to talk about what to do with their nudes during a breakup so it isn't up in the air.",

He wasn't trying to hurt anyone he was just trying to get off.\n\nMy point is, I don't need to know what my partner is jerking off to, that's his business.  Sexuality isn't rational. Would you be comfortable sharing all the things you've jerked off to in your life?",

There\u2019s a plenty of ways to say something, and being mean isn\u2019t the best option. You\u2019re not helping anyone by making them feel judged and not understood.",

Sometimes lust is just lust. Keeping the pictures was not the brightest idea, but not everyone feels the same way about things like nudes as the sweet summer children on here. My wife and I both have some from previous relationships that we kept as mementos, watch porn separately, together, it\u2019s all just communication. OP, you aren\u2019t the brightest bulb but to be with someone for 2 years means you probably haven\u2019t been \u201cphoning it in\u201d and love someone else, and not everyone thinks naked pictures and some wanking are the greatest sin known to man. I hope your girlfriend is one of these people and you work through any hurt feelings she may have and not throw away a presumably heathy relationship.",

His \u201cconsequences\u201d here are to wallow in self-pity and undergo a potential breakup. He cannot do that indefinitely, and even if there is no subjective redemption for him, he can at least take a valuable lesson with him that will prevent him from hurting future/past partners. That\u2019s what matters, him acknowledging his problem, moving on, and fixing himself. You need to realize that people are not typically static characters, we are typically round and become better people due to our failures and shortcomings as people. I\u2019m just glad he got the humble check so they can both learn now rather than later.",

But there\u2019s a couple things:\n\nFirst, overall, you didn\u2019t cheat on her so it shouldn\u2019t be treated as such. Punishment should fit the crime. You don\u2019t want to continue a relationship in debt to your partner for excessively long periods of time. Its unhealthy and unfair to both people. So while being in the wrong in this situation, don\u2019t overcompensate. She will either move past it or she won\u2019t.\n\nSecond, depending on how she is, she may not forget/forgive. And giving her all  access to your stuff so easily sets a precedence of inequity and how future resolutions will be solved if you two stay together. I found myself in a somewhat similar, but not as severe situation about 12 years ago, when my now wife and I started dating. I got rid of what was found, we spoke about it. Granted, I became more careful about what i kept and where on my computer.\n\nI\u2019m not saying my relationship is perfect or whether you two should stay together or break up, but if its a real thing thats meant to last, try to genuinely work it out together.",

You couldn't get off to porn but you CAN to your ex? \nSomething about this story seems to suggest you aren't over her yet. You gotta figure that out. It's pretty rude to keep your ex's photos and videos after you've broken up too.\n\nNow I wouldn't say that your GF should be \"heartbroken\" over that action as others have said. I would say that's extreme. I would personally feel awkward, disrespected, and would want to talk about it. The only thing that could break your GF's heart is if you also have pictures/videos of her and yet chose your ex. Then that's definitely heartbreaking.\n\nIf you're not completely over your ex yet, then that's something you have to talk about with your GF and your ex, you separately. Be completely honest with yourself and them. Maybe, unlikely but maybe, your gf could understand your actions if you said that your ex broke up with you and that you still have some residual feelings for her that you have a hard time letting go (which honestly could be understandable depending on the situation). If that were the case you then would have to make a decision to either delete those photos, or to ebd your relationship with your GF. You can't have both. \n\nIt's probably too late to do anything though. Relationship is probably over. What you did was disrespectful to her and to your ex simultaneously. Good luck",

But word of advice, not only is deleting the nudes the right thing to do, it\u2019ll help moving on and getting yourself good emotionally go much faster. When you\u2019re truly over someone you won\u2019t feel that urge anymore. \n\nPersonally I think sharing passwords and stuff or going through each other\u2019s phones is pointless bc once the trust is gone the relationship is over. Not to say it\u2019s unsalvageable but it will take a really understanding partner and a sincere commitment to better yourself. If she doesn\u2019t dump you you might wanna consider letting her go anyway and working on yourself since it sounds like your current relationship might be a rebound which is obviously unfair to your gf. Good luck.",

My exs, the women that kind of smiled at me the other day, that lady in sheer yoga pants that was crossing the street while walking her dog. To me this is just an extension of that. That coupled with the idea that at one point the woman in the video made the video especially for me. Op could have no further interest in his ex other than viewing her as a sexual object.\n\nI just feel like what you are masturbating to should be your own business.

Tell her she deserves better and not to settle for someone who will be such a dumb fuck.  Own up to the mistake, take it as a life lesson and move on.  \n\nAlso delete the videos of your ex(es?) as a mark of respect for her as well - I imagine she would not be thrilled that you still have them now that the relationship is over (maybe she is, I don\u2019t know, the world is kinky as fuck these days).

Being real about this is the best you've got. Your impotence and how you handled it by objectifying people for a means is your problem, not hers.\n\nI honestly dont think this can work if you're not ready to be with someone that good to you when that's what you've got to offer. I say this without malice, but, face it, having sexual rewards and gratification to get to a climax is a privilage- bodies that become defective over time, but how we treat eachother is timeless and is what is remembered.   \n\n\nIf you thought this was OK int he first place, and you had your ex's nudes, you got a lot deeper stuff to work on, and you shouldn't drag this poor wonderful person through it.",

Then I found out my ex was posting the photos online of exes from like 5 years ago. It took one of the exes finding out from a friend seeing their photo online and threatening to involve law enforcement for my ex to destroy the photos. I begged my ex to delete anything they had of me as I knew I'd end up online as well. I was young and dumb to be in that relationship, and ashamed to say I tried to make it work for too long. My ex was selfish and didn't think about my feelings or his exes. Don't keep ex nudes and definitely never post them online. That is the fastest way to destroy a relationship.",

I mean how pissed would you have been if your gf was getting off to her ex's nudes? \n\nShe has every right to be mad, and if she decides to end things, just take the pain and the lesson and move on and be a better person tomorrow.",

Offering her your privacy (the passwords) is just not a solution for a successful recovery from what amounts to a bad decision and dumb luck. You weren't disloyal, as far as I'm concerned. Once the misunderstanding (that you weren't talking live) was cleared up, obviously she has the right to be hurt but aside from the skeeviness issue of questionable consent to use of old media, it's not a huge deal in my book. \n\nI'm familiar with a lot of people in long term relationships - including my own. The ones that find success are the ones to, yes - address the issue head-on - but also move past briefly bumpy terrain. The ones that failed either buried the problem down and ignored it (this happened to my parents) or the correction (shameless privacy recusal, bowing to the wronged party's whim... as was the case with my sister-in-law) was so overwhelming that trust had no room to maneuver and bloom. \n\nI'm not saying you shouldn't feel some regret. But shame is generally not a productive emotion unless it convinces us we have the duty AND ability to be better people... and not just bemoan our sucky behaviors when they pop up. \n\nI'm glad you're going to couple's therapy. All people in relationships should (I'm in therapy for a variety of reasons but my partner and I do couple's counselling too). But I worry that this will be a case of over-correction and lead to a lengthy battle for a relationship that lost its pulse the moment she caught you.",

If she forgives you she forgives you don't let it be used as ammunition if there are arguments in the future. One thing I will say is don't take much offense to the people calling you \"gross\" or the likes. I've found that the judgemental people like that will have much less savory things hidden in their closets. I hope this all works out for you man no one should have to be in a position like this during the holidays and could've more than likely been fixed by a sit down conversation and not put off for a week plus. Regardless of this situation I hope you can find some happiness in your holidays.",

Of course it was stupid to get caught, but as long as there isn't an emotional thing involved (wanting the ex back), whats the big deal? Its just porn at that point. \n\nReally can't understand the outrage and drama here, maybe it's an american thing because of their weird stance on sexuality, rooted in their puritanical history",

It's extremely disrespectful and shows that OP wasn't over his ex and should have never even been in this relationship to begin with. His current (soon to be ex) gf didn't ask for any of this and doesn't deserve it either. If I found pictures of my girlfriends ex on her phone or whatever like that and I found she used them to get off then you can bet your ass things would not be the same ever again, and rightly so. I think you've tried to oversimplify things to the point that you completely lost the reason why this is so bad.",

Everyone is allowed to have their boundaries off course and if your GF doesn't like you to jerk off to your ex and you think this is reasonable than off course the boundary is set and needs to be respected. I personally think viewing porn is much more of a problem dew to the culture behind it and the ongoing exploitation of the actors. That you couldn't jerk of to porn for 42 min seems strange too, you should definitely look into that.\n\nI think the real problem is that what you did can be interpreted in a lot of ways that have nothing to do with reality. Things like this can absolutely be beneficial for a relationship, instead of just falling to your knees and beg for forgiveness i would seek in depth dialog where you are both brutally honest. She can't look into your head she has no way of knowing what is going on in there, if this is a red flag that points to other behavior she finds disrespectful, if you are still invested in past relationships, if you truly love her. I guess you would feel insecure too if the roles were reversed. This is not done with just talking about this specific issue there needs to be a better deeper connection that isn't that easily shaken. Talk to her what exactly her worries are and work from there, with actions every day that make you two more connected. \n\nI am not even sure this would be a big deal in my relationship. I know what worth i hold for my partner a bit snake wrestling to his ex couldn't threaten that. I would surely want to talk about it if something else is going on but in the end i know my BF loves me for who i am and this is deeper than a sexual fantasy about anyone.\n\nI hope you can both grow because of this.",

I supported her, but resigned myself to remain both of their friends through their separation with some heavy judgement his way. They eventually called off the separation and remained together, agreeing to joint counselling to try to salvage their 12 year relationship and 3 year marriage, primarily for the benefit of their 1 year old daughter. They're currently doing well and it seems to be behind them.\n\nI suspect a huge factor in their decision to remain together was due to them supporting me through my disastrous seperation and custody battle from which they both talked me down from suicide several times. \n\nYour situation is much more disposable. Youre fucked. Do not beg. This is a life lesson you'll take with you to your next relationships. Just try to love them a bit harder next time bud.",

I would recommend people share stuff like that thinking the other person will always have it and decide if that is something they are okay with. Honestly I would go even further and say think about if they are okay with it ending up on the internet and decide if they still want to send it to that person. Don't try to have them promise to delete them because people are prone to forget things, people lie, and people may change their mind as their feelings change. Just assume everything will end up on the internet and then ask yourself if that's okay. If their answer is no and they still send it they are both stupid and naive.",

This is the type of thing that tends to end things and the chance of this turning around is pretty slim.  I\u2019ll tell you as soon as distance starts growing in a relationship, it\u2019s pretty damn hard to stop and close it.  You\u2019re also going to be on her parents and friends shit list when it comes out. I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but if it makes it to January 1st I\u2019d be surprised :(\n\nThis single event has destroyed her confidence. She no longer feels like she\u2019s attractive to you and feels like a consolation prize to your ex. The key to this is you have to make her feel beautiful, attractive, and that she\u2019s the only woman in the world. The major problem though is she is going to want space. So if you push to that too hard, it will do more harm than good. You\u2019re at her mercy at this point. You gotta figure out if she\u2019s truly the one and if not, you gotta walk away because it\u2019s what would be best for her. No point in working things out if she isn\u2019t the one. If you fix things and leave later, she will be destroyed.  If she is the one, you have to do what she needs. She will need space while also reassurance. Don\u2019t push more than she wants, but you need to show her you care. Make concessions that put her first those types of things.",

Attraction is a normal human emotion and will happen so don't expect it not to or guilt them for feeling it.  Keeping their pics is fucked up though. I don't think it's instant break up material but ops girlfriend probably does considering that she went off to Christmas with her family and doesn't want to talk about it.

You\u2019re both young & there\u2019s no sense in beating a dead relationship. \n\nSecond, work on reducing & eventually stop with the *excessive* masturbating. That is a known fact, since you mentioned \u201cyou struggled to get off after 40 minutes.\u201d\n\nThird, seek professional help. The reason for this is, your decision making was compromised due to a problem. Sex/porn addiction becomes a problem when you have to seek outside sources drugs, prostitution, ex\u2019s photos/video, etc. \n\n\nThe digital age is ruining folks & if this comment can help you. All the better.

Some states have had their revenge porn laws overturned by their own state supreme courts due to unconstitutionality, such as Minnesota.

Otherwise pornstars would be able to retroactively take down anything they don't want online, which they wouldn't be able to without explicit contracts, like I said in my original comment)  \n\n\n>Better example would be the fappening..\n\nThe Fappening was the theft of large troves of I cloud data, the act of stealing it was illegal, as was hosting the images, but the images existing on the icloud accounts of the people they were stolen from (even ex boyfriends) wasn't remotely illegal \n\n\n>In the end here, you're still trying to defend and move the goal posts\n\n\n\n\nLmao what? Move goalposts? \n\nYou brought up revenge porn laws in response to being told you have no copyright protection over the naked images your partner took of you, or that you consent ally gave to your partner\n\nThey have every right, legally and morally, to continue owning the images they took of you. The images and copyright are the property of the people who took them, and the act of giving someone an image you took allows them to own that image (though they don't have copyright over that image)\n\n\n>And that's not creepy and sad because why?\n\nLol pointing out that you were wrong about having the legal ownership of images that someone has of you is not creepy or sad \n\nWhat's pretty sad is acting morally righteous to strangers on a meme website \n\n>How about you don't be a creep yeah? plenty of porn of consenting adults there for you.\n\nLol yeah like the porn that was made by consenting adults in relationships \n\nDon't let people film your sexual encounters if you think that you magically posses copyright ownership of your gibblies, that isn't how anything works",

You shift goalposts as quickly and nimbly as you do mental gymnastics lmfao \n\n\n\n>This shows you trying to hide behind legality is at best a technicality and not at all moral.\n\nLol I'm not hiding behind anything, I've openly stated that it isn't remotely immoral \n\nYou originally incorrectly brought up copyright law in an attempt to hide behind legality in order to justify being able to revoke ownership of a photograph, a premise with no moral and no legal justification whatsoever\n\nYou have no copyright ownership of your naked body. You incorrectly thought that you did, and had this corrected. \n\n>It's not moral either because of conditional consent\n\nYou do not have any right to \"revoke consent\" of someone possessing a digital or physical image that was taken consentually \n\n>So the legality is a gray area\n\nIt's not remotely a gray area, you do not have any right to take back ownership of an image that someone received consentually\n\nJust like you have no right to break into someone's house and steal back a gift you gave them \n\nIt's not gray, it's black and white \n\n>morally it's wrong\n\nLol if you believe nude photography is immoral, that's on you, but your puritanical beliefs mean nothing to the rest of us \n\nIf you don't like the fact that pictures exist after you take them, don't allow people to take pictures of you naked, or send people naked pictures \n\nIt's really simple \n\n>So in essence without getting express consent, you are doing something involving a person against their will..\n\nLol allowing the picture to be taken, or giving someone a nice picture is the express consent\n\n\nLike like giving someone a gift is giving them express consent to keep that item \n\nUnless you expressway told them that they CANNOT keep a picture that you gave them, you are thinking there is some sort of implicit agreement which does not exist \n\nAll of the nudes I have gotten, I have never been asked to delete, and in one case during a hook up almost a year after our breakup, after inquiring whether or not I still have the collection we made, she joked that I needed a more up to date version of her on file and posed for another \n\n>Also I think trying to compare having nude images to the paparazzi was the main offender of you moving the goal posts.\n\nSuch a comparison was never made, paparazzi was mentioned because you incorrectly claimed a model's likeness could not be used even if a photographer owned a photo that they took, which is absolutely false. \n\nThe mental gymnastics you have about making incorrect legal statements, being corrected, and then extrapolating absolutely ridiculous conclusions from that is astounding. \n\nI'll go ahead and copy and paste the statement again, since it remains true \n\nThey have every right, legally and morally, to continue owning the images they took of you.

People like to call porn fantasy and it's not fantasy if you have had rapport with them. That's history, not fantasy. Also girls know not to compare themselves with the girls they see on porn. But this wasn't porn. He literally chose to look at his ex getting pounded by his dick than to look at anything else in the world. It's alarming and sad and a punch and a kick to the girls self esteem. Especially if the guy owns any nudes or sexy videos of her. If not, I guess now is the time to make one, though now you have to consider that in the future if y'all break up that he might be jerking off to your video when his new bright non-traumatized girl walks in and sees it and now and forever will compare herself to the guys she dates exes just because one guy could not just stick with normal porn videos or pics of his current girlfriend. \n\n\"So much easier said than done\". No... not really. Not difficult at all if you respect the women you been with. The videos, out of respect, wouldn't be on the phone. But people have to suck. People gotta just pick a day to traumatize the girlfriends like it's a tradition or something. \n\n\nI have a feeling of men hoarding personal porn videos their exes sent to them while they currently was in a relationship. After they break up, some men still feel as if they have some sort of right to those videos. As if they \"earned\" the right to keep them. And sure, the woman did send the videos/knew it was being taken of her, what she can't forsee is her now ex keeping her photos to do a quick nut for eternity. Ah, another conquest conquered- definitely not a human being with emotions who might have felt disrespected if she knew her nasty weird ex waa busting his nut to her videos she thought was deleted and long gone. But no, men have to prove time and time again that they're scum of the Earth.",

                  "text": "I said women know not to compare themselves to porn because that's what we been taught since forever. And it is the correct way to believe. People watch over exaggerated \"sex\" scenes that barely could be called sex anymore.  So yes, don't compare yourself to a caricature version of a person and a caricature circus version of what sex is supposed to be. Everything is exaggerated in porn. Just within the last ten years there has been a boom of female porn producers that provide safe working conditions/as safe as possible and direct the porn themselves. I'm staying away from the feminist word since people straight away have an aversion to the word since the word has been molded to something it doesn't actually mean. But they was for women's protection and rights. I went into a sex shop in Portland Oregon to look for some binders and the lady showed me them, I have never been a big porn watcher unlike my friends and my bf was feeling uncomfortable so I decided to skip viewing it but had a really nice talk with the woman who is actually involved in the production. That was around 2012. Now those women might be more realistic than other adult actresses but it is still acting and fantasy. It is wrote, directed, filmed. acted, acted, paid, tuned and altered, fixed, added in sounds and props, and burned to a CD and loaded online to a subscription based website. It's a production. So unless you're pretending and acting to be in a porn while having sex with your S/O then there isn't any reason to compare yourself with actresses. Now, do women still get upset and hurt and emotionally pained when their spouse watches porn and gets caught, yeah some do. Some think \"why couldn't he come to me\", \"my breast are not that large\", \"he only views super thin women, I am plus size\"... do you see the recurring theme? They're comparing themselves. Now if the man is blatant and uncaring and watches the pornography right in front of her knowing it hurts her feelings or they have a porn addiction, a literal illness, it is different. \n\n\nAnd you're assuming in here that she didn't ask him when she very well could have. I have made several sex videos with men and sent them the copy when they asked. These were not men I was dating. And the entire reason of filming was to get off later with it. So the reason was already known. \n\n\nThe problem with some men is they view women they have dated as objects afterwards. A tool to get off of. Some guy posted on reddit saying that he has nudes of a dead girl and it feels like he has a rare pokemon card .. wow that's such a sad way to view a deceased person, then he contemplated on SHARING or KEEPING to himself the \"rare pokemon cards\". He isn't the only man to feel like this by far. To them it is exactly how he describes it. And you're putting all the responsibility on the woman to ask the man to please delete all the sexual themed videos and pictures of them. Well, that might not be the best idea if the relationship ended badly and the woman is afraid to ask it and bring it up because the man now knows he can use the fact that he has these images to weaponize against her. She might just have hope if she stays quiet that they fall to the back of their picture folder and he will add new shit to it and not come across hers again. This is also assuming. But we can assume the proper thing to do when you end the relationship is to delete the intimate photos you have of the other person that you're no longer with. That's the proper thing to do, or ask them if it's ok to keep them. Ah, see the people who have the pictures can ask too, not just the women who now have to pretend to be sweet to get the men to delete the photos which RARELY happens anyways and they're mostly lied to. Which is the risk you take when sending nudes and videos. But we're only human. Keeping them against peoples wishes is a shit human thing to do. Also, thinking Oh! This \"pokemon card\" will be great to use! As they have mentally checked out of the past relationship but still have the memory of fucking this person and can better fantasize about them doing other things. So ofcourse the guy fucked up here. He has learned from it. But his girlfriend has some mental trauma that will never fully go away without therapy and even then... it'll be in the back of her mind with every man she dates. \"Is he looking at porn or his most recent ex?\" \"Is his ex hotter than me?\" \"If I ask him to delete any sexual photos of his exes will I be gaslighted as a controlling bitch?\" \"Maybe if I send him some pictures and videos of me he won't look at others\"(surprise, he won't. Because when he's looking to get off, his brain dehumanizes people and now they're just a tool to help him get off. Not being negative it is just something that happens. That's why people joke about being grossed out after they masturbate because they'll pick the most weirdest shit to get off of and when they're humanizing area of their brain kicks back on they can truly see how fucked up what they got aroused to, was.)\n\n\nSo a guy learned his lesson here by deeply hurting his girlfriend. Bravo. \n\nI was on ambien when I wrote the first post so I probably would have wrote it in a softer light if I wasn't fucked up but eh, it can stay like that because they shouldn't have to learn by hurting others. But there's no handbook on this, just common sense and that goes out the window when people get horny so still a thumbs down on the guy hurting his girlfriend inadvertently.",

I agree there is a double standard here but one contradiction which I think is reasonable is analogizing porn to video games. \n\nIt\u2019s wrong to rob banks and kill people, it\u2019s not wrong to engage in pseudo versions of this fantasy by via playing GTA V. Would the same not apply to porn? It\u2019s wrong to cheat on your SO. Its not wrong to engage in a pseudo fantasy version of this.\n\nI guess the rebuttal would be: when you engage in the murder fantasy by playing GTA 5 you\u2019re not engaging in murder. When you engage in the sexual fantasy by watching porn, you\u2019re cheating, and cheating is wrong. Hmmm. Well, I guess this simply depends on if your SO considers it cheating. Being in an open relationship with two consenting partners isn\u2019t cheating, it\u2019s an open relationship. The same applies if your SO is fine with porn. If they\u2019re not then there\u2019s plenty of ground to consider the engagement in pornographic material to be cheating. (premise1) you\u2019re doing the same as watching your ex\u2019s nudes except without an emotional connection. (premise2) even if you have an inability to create emotions with anyone who isn\u2019t your SO, having sex with a stranger would still be cheating. (conclusion) whether or not you\u2019re cheating isn\u2019t based on emotions. If watching your ex girlfriends nudes is wrong/cheating and you engage in (1) and (2) is true, then what you\u2019re doing is cheating/wrong.\n\nI typed this out mostly for me. I now think it is cheating in my case, and in the case where any SO considers it cheating.",

OP\u2018s behavior is not normal, and i wouldn\u2018t trust anyone siding with him, to be in healthy committed relationships. you wouldn\u2018t side with OP if OP were a woman. you wouldn\u2018t  shrug it off if your gf did it. classic reddit",

Talk and figure out where the other person is coming from.  And if you guys decide to work it out. Talk more about what turns you on too. Support your partners interests. \n\nMy two cents.",

It wasn't right to keep them as they were meant for me in the context of our relationship.  Since we were no longer together, those pictures needed to go too. I was 21 at that time.\n\nNow I'm 36, with my wife for 15 years and married for 12.  I have some nudes my wife has given me/I've taken over the years.  These are for us and us only, of course.\n\nPersonally, fantasizing about past sexual adventures can be fun.   I also think there is a bit of a difference in fantasizing with your mind's eye as opposed to pulling up images/videos of people in your life.  The theater of the mind can be a cool place.  \n\nMy wife doesn't care if I'm watching porn, heck we watch it together a lot.  I know she would have an issue with me looking at nudes of my exes or people in my life right now and I would have issue with her doing the same thing.  \n\nGood on you for deleting them and good luck working through this one together",

I will securely store them off site and there is no chance (once you empty out your send box) where she can ever trace it to an internet stranger.  \n\nI mean, if you can't trust an internet stranger to safely store your intimate pics and vids, who *can* you trust?\n\nedit:  yeah, this is probably a *future* TIFU in the making, \"TIFU by sending my ex's nudes to an internet stranger for safekeeping\"",

I may not have photos saved but I won\u2019t lie about having fantasized about other people while rubbing one out.\n\nI was also a stripper for a long time and polyamorous for years. Maybe I have way more lax views than most on this topic but he wasn\u2019t actually cheating so once I got over the initial shock of it\u2019s pretty much not an issue.\n\nI still give him shit for it (like in a joking sort of way) because my response aside, it\u2019s still pretty shitty and stupid to keep all those mementos.

Everyone here has completely fucked up in some situation in their life. \n\nThat being said I think I sense possibly the most important element from you: remorse.\nYou know you've screwed everything up. \nYou hopefully realized just how important to you your girlfriend is. I encourage the counseling. \n\nBut there's really only one way to win someone back, and there aren't any easy shortcuts to do it. \nYou've breached trust between you and now the burden is on you to rebuild that. \n\nApologies are a nice sentiment but they don't rebuild shit. Be there for her. Show her with your actions that you're willing to work on whatever deep inside made you feel like doing that. Demonstrate that you're changing. Recognize this may take months or years.\n\nI know from personal experience. My wife and I separated for almost two years and that whole time I demonstrated to her not with words but actions that I finally recognized how truly priceless she is and how much I wanted to reconcile. \n\nBe completely vulnerable and transparent. Don't get angry if she's insecure about things in the future and brings up your fuck up. Let her vent every single time. Listen and don't be defensive.\n\nLast step and probably the hardest: accept the fact that despite all your efforts, it's ultimately her decision and her heart that decides. Acknowledge that that decision may not be in your favor and she may choose to walk away. If she does, it's just consequences. \n\nYour relationship will never be the same once you've violated trust. But with enough work and love it can be even better. My wife and I made it and we are so much stronger now for what we've been through.\n\nMuch love and good luck.",

She be out there doing Christmas shopping, buying shit that\u2019s meant for you. I can only imagine how hurt she must feel. Once trust is broken, it\u2019ll never be the same again. Please believe me. You\u2019ll feel anxious all the time, some even get sleep and health problems because of the distrust, suspicion and lack of security in the relationship. So you\u2019ll end up questioning literally everything. That\u2019s not healthy for either of you. \nYou clearly have issues of your own that you need to work on before you can have a healthy relationship with yourself, only after you\u2019ve dealt with them you could be in a healthy relationship with someone else.\n\nYall know emotional cheating is cheating too right? And to be precise, this was kinda physical as well. So there was cheating for the past 2 years. I really don\u2019t know how to fix something like this",

One or two are quite open with their wives about what particular ex partners were like (including the physical). To some people this is \u201cweird\u201d or dysfunctional. In truth, it\u2019s what the closest relationships are like. Nothing is taboo or out of bounds. There are no thought police. You are what you are - fantasies and all. Being able to share such sensitive or taboo feelings is a sign of two people who are as  close as love can take them.",

May you live a life cursed to cum to your exes because no one wants your musty duck :)",

      "text": "This is actually so bad that one doesn't even need to expand the spoiler tag and read the post. Just the title alone. I try very hard to not judge people right away. I used to do so. I used to be good at it. I'm kind of sick of it. But to then read this:\n\n>what the fuck do I do to make this right\n\nYou're a child. I need to break this to you now before you break someone else. The real subtext here is that your girlfriend isn't good enough for you. You don't actually want her. You want someone else. You're not in love, you're in lust. Or worse, you may even be an emotionally manipulative monster that just uses multiple girls to get off and want to retain this one as long as possible. We don't actually know the full extent of it. Try the thought experiment of you coming home and she's watching your friend jack it with an intensity she's never showed you. Why's she need him? Are you not enough?\n\nWas what you wanted from this woman something that wasn't a relationship, perhaps? A friends with benefits mutual sex arrangement, perhaps? Maybe you should have made that clear from the start. This action would make a lot more sense in a \"platonic except for sex\" arrangement because doing this in an exclusive relationship is a good way to pack that relationship into a cannon and fire it into the sun.\n\nWe're not gorillas. We don't just walk around fucking *everyone else* in civilized society. And actually, gorillas don't even do that either. This is more like the behavior of a single celled organism.\n\nHow do you \"get her back?\" She's not yours to go retrieve. She's not an object that you lost. You resume the relationship if she's ok with you having sex with other people, because that's effectively what you did. If she valued your exculsivity in your intimate lives, then all future intimate interactions will be tainted by these thoughts. You're not fixing that. Fixing that would require going into her brain and rewiring the fucking thing, because that decision isn't up to you. The fact that you asked \"how do I get her back\" is evidence that you don't understand this so I'll write it again to get it through your skull. **The decision isn't up to you.** You don't get to DO anything except wait for her response.\n\nAnd I can't speak to that. Some people are swingers and play around like that. Humankind as a whole can be very... interesting. But her initial reaction tells me everything I need to know. If that's the outcome, if the outcome here is \"she's a swinger and everything's cool XDXD,\"  it was a very low % one.\n\nYou seem to have misunderstood how relationships work. *You're* not in a relationship with *her*. *The two of you* are in a relationship *with each other.* \n\nThe pictures/video being gone doesn't matter. Continue this relationship and one day you will hear the words \"then just go jerk off to your ex!\" Does that *sound like* it'll lead anywhere good?\n\nAt best, start getting professional relationship counseling. If there's a way out of this that doesn't involve you being immature, a monster, her being traumatized, or all three, I don't see it. Maybe a professional can. Or maybe you're both secretly swinger nymphos. I don't know. You don't know. She doesn't know. We don't know.",

Consent is contextual, and the end of a relationship often means the consent for you to keep those nudes is gone. The expected thing to do is delete your ex's nudes. It is creepy as fuck to keep them, unless you've been given permission to.\n\n2) Your girlfriend is going to consistently associate you being able to cum with your ex. She's going to have some deep scarring from this. If you did have permission to keep the nudes, you should have discussed this with your girlfriend up front. You can have all the fucking kinks for your exes you want if you just *talk* about it and get permission. How hard is it for folks to accept sex is 50% communication?\n\n3) Your girlfriend will probably tell your ex about this if you break up. You're going to have two fires to put out here, because as I said in point one, this is creepy as fuck.\n\nDon't keep your ex's nudes after you break up without their permission. Don't hide your sexual fetishes from your partner. Do start to worry, because despite your edit your relationship is fucked up unless you start to communicate properly.",

Me and my partner have an agreement that when he wants to jerk off to the exes he asks me and I let him know if I'm ok with that. This is because most of the times I'm indifferent to it (the way I see it, it's only sexual and just fantasies), but there are times when it bothers me (i.e. if we hadn't been intimate with each other in a while) and we both know that consent can change, so he always asks and I always let him know if it's alright for me. If I came home one day and saw him do this without asking, I would feel extremely hurt and betrayed and have a really hard time trusting anything he says. I hope you guys can patch this up.",

But your girlfriend is not gonna be ok with this in the long run if this is how she reacts. You're not cheating (don't let the comment section here tell you differently) but everyone has their own limits. \n\nI have to ask; why don't you jerk it to your current GFs nudes? Why is your exGF's content so hot to you? Introspect a bit. Ask yourself what actually gets you going -is it her body? The thrill of the forbidden? A kink she was willing to indulge? Do you still miss her, or do you just miss the sex? It won't save your current relationship,  but will likely get you a more obvious outlook on what you're looking for in the future.",

The fact that you only deleted them once you were caught by her is really dissapointing. Its obvious there's a huge lack of communication, and if she is able to forgive you for this, you will need couples therapy for a while to have a professional help sort things out for you. What you did is second worse to cheating since there was 0 consent on your gfs side for you to use your exs nudes. Whats so hurtful for her is that it isnt just porn anymore, there is now an emotional connection tied to what you decided to get off on. If you both move forward with the relationship, be ready for an incredible amount of doubt, skepticism, hurt, and silence. If not, then you know what mistake to never do in the future. Tell your gf that not all men are like this and that trust can be rebuilt with the right one. This is coming from someone who has left multiple men with porn addictions and I have been previously very broken because of it. Im now engaged to a wonderful man and I want her to know theres hope because of how damaging what you did to her was. Good luck to both of you.",

The sad thing is, they'll probably try to recover from it for a while because relationships are complicated, but things will disintegrate in the process.  She'll never forget that, and she can try to forgive him, but there will probably come a time when she admits to herself that she can't.  \n\nThis dude regularly jerks off to his ex from almost 2 years ago, even though he's serious enough with his current girlfriend to live with her.  He couldn't get off after watching porn for 40 MINUTES, so I can imagine his sex life with his girlfriend ~~is~~ was garbage if he's that desensitized.  And I'll bet that during that 3 hour drive his girlfriend took, she thought about all the bad sex they've had and blamed herself for not being OP's ex.  Probably spent a lot of time comparing herself to the ex and wondering why he can't let her go when he has someone new now.  \n\nOP is weird af for this and I hope his (ex?)girlfriend finds someone better.",

That is called addiction. If you  are doing it enough that you can\u2019t cum it\u2019s pretty obvious this goes beyond  not being turned on enough to release. Gonna call you on the fact you even thought it would ever be ok to knock one out to your ex\u2019s nudes or vid\u2019s. Are you like 19 or what? I struggle thinking men can actually be that naive or ignorant so it has to fall more under the I don\u2019t give a shit about other peoples feelings category. I would leave my husband over that, consider yourself lucky if she stays but I would consider her foolish  if she does. Behavior like that doesn\u2019t  change overnight\u2026.. it\u2019s bad enough you wanted your jerk off day as soon as she was gone long enough to do it but that you went to imagery of someone you have been physically intimate with is just awful. It speaks volumes about you. I feel sorry for your girlfriend the best thing she could do for herself would be to RUN away from the red flags you are tossing up in the air. Run as fast as she can and never look back. What you did is horrific and honestly can cause Mental trauma to your spouse. Coming from someone that has lived something similar  to this in the past I can say without a doubt she will never look at you the same way even if she still loves you. You can\u2019t put the toothpaste back in the tube dude!!",

Ever. \n\nI\u2019ve been with my current SO for over ten years, and he\u2019s the only one who wasn\u2019t hung up on his ex (that I was aware of, but confident it\u2019s not a thing, especially now).

Even if they didn\u2019t want to be in a relationship with their ex, their vying and desiring (and fantasizing), broke my heart. It\u2019s a never ending comparison game and it sucks the life out of you. \n\nWishing you retrospect and humility in your future endeavors, OP.

Naked strangers wasn't enough and the photos and video was the only way to cross the finish line. Had nothing to do with emotional attachment or pining and everything to do with needing \"more material\".\n\nDeleting all that stuff is good but if you want to recover you say you're giving up porn in general because of the harm it's done to you and your warped sense of sex.

He told me he kept the photos of ex\u2019s as some sort of trophy. His accomplishments. I personally wouldn\u2019t want to date a guy who keeps that sort of stuff. However I wish I was a person who was more confident and open with that. Because it\u2019s not fair to tell a new partner they need to get rid of every memory from their other lovers, who were important to them and may still be. It\u2019s not realistic to think we will stop loving our past partners the moment we are \u201cloyal\u201d to a new one.  \n\nThat all said, I ended up writing the girl he had photos of and found out she had sent them to him while we were together. I was pissed. I can\u2019t trust guys. I can\u2019t trust girls. The only thing I trust is that people are not to be trusted.",

I know a lot of people on here aren\u2019t going to agree, but men look at love differently than women do and that\u2019s something you just need to try to convey to her.",

You\u2019re undoubtedly feeling awful right now and people dog piling on you doesn\u2019t help. I\u2019d suggest working through your feelings and not overly beating yourself up. You did what you did, and there is a reason for it. That reason could be you\u2019re not over your ex, or you don\u2019t have stronger feelings for your current girlfriend. Either way, try to see this as a learning experience. I wish you the best.",

Sounds like you guys are working on it, so great. Maybe that means the relationship is great overall and this was just a lapse of judgement. Good luck OP.

You shouldn\u2019t have kept them (because also that\u2019s a violation of your ex\u2019s trust; once you break up she hasn\u2019t consented to your keeping her nudes anymore), but you did and you can\u2019t change that. You have DEFINITELY been given the biggest second chance ever. \n\nThat said, making you sleep on the couch isn\u2019t fair. I get she\u2019s hurt, but if she\u2019s giving you the chance to make it up to her she can\u2019t punish you. She doesn\u2019t get to say \u2018I\u2019m giving you another chance but only if you do x y and z for me\u2019. You make the decision to move on as a couple and endure the discomfort. If she doesn\u2019t want to sleep next to you, then she can stay somewhere else for a few days, or SHE can sleep on the couch. \n\nI think in counseling it\u2019ll be important to talk about why you were jerking off to your ex\u2019s nudes, but it will also be important to talk about what BOTH of you can do to move forward, not how you can grovel and beg until she allows you back into the bed.",

You don\u2019t mean to, but they just pop in your head for a split second, and it works because you have that weird kinky feeling of being with your current and them in a sense. Of course you feel bad about it, but it\u2019s not like you could help it. If that makes sense?\n\nLike I said, don\u2019t let this turn into a big YOU problem in the eyes of your girlfriend or anyone else. You may have betrayed her trust, but it\u2019s not like you went out and got with her in person. So make sure it stays on that level. I could see this going down the rabbit hole of you seeing some shrink and your girlfriend and then basically gang up on you and tell you that you\u2019re unfaithful or a pig or something because of it, so then you\u2019re always \u201cindebted\u201d to your girlfriend. That\u2019s not a healthy relationship dynamic either.\n\nJust don\u2019t let it get blown out of proportion. Was it wrong? Yea. Was it a little weird? Sure. But this doesn\u2019t make you a bad boyfriend or man because you made a choice to have a quick fantasy.",

If you have issues getting there maybe past experiences would be better. Doesn't mean you want them, youre past it for a reason or many. I'd encourage making new memories and material with what you are in love with but I dont really think having moments of happy and using them to cum is horrid. It's comfort food when frustrated. Porn can be a no go and thats okay. The scenarios might not work for you and if you need a personal connection yes work on it with your spouse. The key here I think anyways is communication and her understanding that. I'd be hurt I think most would, it gives self doubt. If you realize you need a connection to what you watch it could open doors and not shut them. Try and have an open discussion on if she's interested in that for you and what you take from it. \n\nIt could be you being a fuck up, more likely than not you're not over your ex. If it's more what works for your situation you need to communicate porn doesn't help and you'd love her help more. Some people would be down and others wouldn't. Regardless though you really shouldn't hang onto the past and especially in a way that will hurt someone you care about. Put yourself in her shoes.",

Either way it was idiotic, wrong and extremely disrespectful and if you thought it was ok to do that for nearly two years then she deserves way better.\n\nEdit: the more I think about this the angrier I get. I think you should break things off now to be honest - you have no right to expect to be with her still after this, you don't deserve it and things will never be the same anyway - you should do her at least this one kindness after the pain you've caused and just end it now. Giving her passwords and showing that things are deleted is nowhere near good enough - there is no good enough, this should never have happened. If you care for her at all then just break things off and let her find somebody who a really appreciates her, and while you're at it sort out whatever hang ups you clearly have.  Sorry if this sounds harsh but what you've done over the course of nearly two years shows you have no respect at all and were not even ready to be in this relationship, so do the right thing and give her closure and hopefully one day you can move on too.",

If its that bad and you need to fap solo, your current girl should be the one you're fapping to, so you should have gotten new material from her, or maybe watched a different genre to change it up, and if that didn't work then give up and take out the pent up nut on her later!!

But my main advice would be, don't try to find out how to get her back, have a long hard look at yourself and find out why you did what you did. Realise how much you hurt your partner and be honest with her and yourself. You need to realise how bad what you did was, and not just because you got caught. If you can GENUINELY take responsibility for the hurt you caused, and realise WHY what you did was so hurtful, and communicate that to her, maybe she'll give you another chance. But she's perfectly in her rights to cut you loose.\n\nEDIT: Honestly the most fucked up thing is keeping the nudes. Delete. That. Shit.",
