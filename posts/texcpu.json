I don't even think they can be used on \"prepared foods\" so no grocery store rotisserie/fried chicken which are even coded separately as sales tax items than raw/unprepared foods. Although that money not spent on groceries frees up the actual cash to then spend elsewhere.\n\nCan just change it to \"On large pack of wings, etc\" \n\nI see people get yelled at any time they complain about the EBT money get spent on steaks and other meats because \"why shouldn't they get to eat good food\" but it still irks me that I don't get free food money and couldn't afford such luxuries like that. Long time ago when I worked as a grocery cashier, I'd lament the EBT disbursement dates when I'd see a ton of a certain type of person come through with hundreds of dollars of high priced meats. \n\n(My solution to this cringe is not to just take away their benefits, but make them available for everyone and let the prices take care of the distribution. Essentially UBI for food to serve as an equalizing pressure.)",

Of course I will die - what is your point there?\n\nI'm not a dick to anyone, I love all people including gays. I don't judge them for their sexuality because it's not my place to judge and I don't particularly care about their sexuality anyway. It shouldn't be an interesting quality for *any* person, yet many have made it their defining characteristic. Sounds to me like a shallow existence.\n\nDo what you want, like I said, but don't promote homosexuality to society as if it's natural and healthy, which it isn't.",

It's more about accumulated geographical advantages and cultural technology, namely cultures gestated in less geographically isolated areas with less isolation to exposure from other cultures in general are the economically dominant cultures we see today. \n\nJews spent 3000 years at the intersection of three continents on the edge of one of the most significant waterways for trade, exported their beliefs on the nature of the divine to eventual billions of people, then spent roughly 1929 years as wandering exiles in foreign land. No wonder they'd be doing well for themselves. They are experts at toeing the line between assimilation and tradition from millenia of resisting harmful cultural influence and adopting beneficial ones (harmful vs. beneficial axis is bookishness good).\n\nThe gap between achievement is basically open-minded trading folk vs. xenophobic mountain folk.\n\nAgain this is only comparing people by their productive capabilities for the economy, which is only one (barely) measurable thing you can use to rank groups. Questions of inferiority or superiority are questions of which measure do you value the most, and those are so incredibly subjective that these conversations are basically stupid. But that doesn't stop people from stating what they personally value is the most objectively correct thing to value and oppress people because they can't conceive of a world where someone could disagree with them and be just as right as they are.",
