I doubt many in Putin's inner circle want what's happening - sanctions hurt them, they're at risk, they have to watch their own country crumble. They have to tow Putin's line. They can't escape, or they'll accidently sniff novichok while feeding pidgeons on some overseas park bench. So they have to sit in front of international media and make at least a token effort of coming across as a supporter of Putin's desires just so that they and their families manage to live another day.",

That included some elite sniper forces, making the symbolism stronger\n\n- during and after WW2, when USSR created Air Forces, they decided to give them stripes for their uniform too\n\n- war in Afghanistan again saw some of the Air forces and Navy forces volunteering on the ground, still wearing stripes\n\n- now all the Russian military wears Telnyashkas",

He reportedly controls RosUkrEnergo (among other things), 50% of which is owned by Gazprom. Linked to Dmytro Firtash.\n  \nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semion_Mogilevich\n  \n\u201cThe company makes its profit on re-exporting gas to Europe. The size of the profit is defined by Gazprom through the export allowances of about 9 billion cubic meters a year. RosUkrEnergo supplies gas to the Hungarian gas distributor Emfesz, for example, which is also controlled by Firtash via his holding company Group DF.\n  \nEffectively, by engaging in this supply scheme Gazprom transfers profits from its shareholders to the shareholders of RosUkrEnergo.\u201d\n  \n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/RosUkrEnergo\n  \nOrganized crime and oligarchs all the way down.\n  \n\n___\n\nEdit - guess who Mogilevich\u2019s US attorney was until he died of Covid in 2020?\n  \n  \n\n\u201cWilliam Sessions, former FBI Director from 1987 to 1993 during the Presidencies of Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush (41), was Mogilevich's attorney in the United States until Sessions' death on June 12, 2020.[18][19]\u201d\n  \nThat\u2019s right, a former FBI director (no relation to Jeff Sessions btw) was the US attorney for a man who was previously on the FBI\u2019s most wanted list and who \n  \n\n    \u201c\u2026is described by agencies in the European Union and United States as the \"boss of bosses\" of most Russian Mafia syndicates in the world,[5] he is believed to direct a vast criminal empire and is described by the FBI as \"the most dangerous mobster in the world.\"[6][4] He has been accused by the FBI of \"weapons trafficking, contract murders, extortion, drug trafficking, and prostitution on an international scale.\"[7]\u201d\n  \n\n\nA former director of the FBI was this man\u2019s US attorney and the only reason why he isn\u2019t anymore is because he died of Covid/heart failure at 90 years old.",

Normally the stores are drained during winter and are refilled starting in March. You can see in the above link that this was the usual pattern for many years. Except last March Gazprom didn't refill the stores. Not in Germany, not in Austria. For gas delivery Gazprom now relies more or less exclusively on the gas transported via their pipelines, there's no backup in stores.\n\nNow the question is: Why would a state owned company choose to risk it's capacity to deliver their main product during the period of highest demand, if creating such risk were not the very goal?",

So their watches would have to have said something like 4:00 or 6:00 because the event was \"live.\"\n\nHowever, they're in Moscow. There is only \\***1**\\* timezone that is behind Moscow (UTC +3) and that is Kaliningrad Time, which is UTC +2. That's a one hour difference. All of the other 9 time zones are *ahead* of Moscow time, so if they were truly set to a different timezone, their watches should be showing time well beyond 5PM.\n\nSo, if we say their watches are in fact showing 10:45PM, that means they would be set to UTC +8, which is the timezone in \tIrkutsk (aka Irkutsk Time). There is nothing in Irkutsk, it's in the middle of Siberia and is still only the 5th largest city in Siberia. You don't put important political figureheads somewhere like that.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_Russia\n\ntl;dr - it is totally staged.",

He had groups of people to make accounts to spread false information (mostly on Facebook) by making it seem like it was coming from an American account and using old American nostalgia to reel them in. Like those \"back in my day\" posts and stuff. If you go and click on any of those kinds of posts and trace the account to its origin country, it's always Russia pretending to be American. \n\n\n\nIt was to slowly radicalize them and the Republican party. It worked like a charm, people on Facebook (it's mostly boomers left) ate that shit right up. It's brainwashing. His whole goal was to weaken America by radicalizing and causing division. And these people, when you talk to them, they repeat the same stuff identically to each other WORD by WORD. Like robots. It's like they were trained to say the same few responses and dismiss anything they don't agree with as false news made up by the left. I hate politics to damn much anymore because of how toxic and crazy it has gotten. There's a great YouTube video that explains how radicalizing someone happens btw: \n\nhttps://youtu.be/P55t6eryY3g",

The president also don't have the authority to just cede federal property to another country. \n\nJoseph Holt, in a correspondence with confederate senators, [told them that they were almost certainly not getting the fort and any attempt to take it by force or to interrupt its operation would be seen as a declaration of war.](https://books.google.com/books?id=v5E9AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA178#v=onepage&q&f=false)\n\nWhen [a ship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_of_the_West) was sent with troops and supplies, it was repelled by confederate gunfire; the shots that started the war.\n\nWhether you not you want to argue that SC was entitled to the fort (it wasn't) or that they were justified in shooting at the ship (they weren't) is another matter, but it was undeniably southern gunfire, southern aggression, and southern men that started the war. It just looks bad that they also ended up losing it.\n\nEdit: It should *also* be noted that the Union didn't immediately attack after this event- rather, P. G. T. Beauregard and Jefferson Davis ordered attacks directly on Fort Sumter after continued refusal by Major Robert Anderson to surrender it. Even still, the fort did not return fire (though mostly because it was not equipped to do so) for two hours after the attack began. This is actually where Edmund Ruffin claims to have fired the first shot of the war, even if the ones fired upon *The Star of the West* were likely the actual first.",

They didn't have all the Confederate generals and leaders hanged for treason, instead granting full amnesty. Plantation owners weren't imprisoned for their human rights violations, instead they were allowed to keep their land and rent it out to the very people they had previously enslaved. \n\nMany of the more radical politicians from the North wanted to punish the south and it's leaders and to make the south *earn* it's place back on the United States, but Lincoln and his successor Johnson were more interested in reconciliation and moving on than they were in actually stamping out the ideologies that led to the war.\n\nLook up Lincoln's [Ten Percent Plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_percent_plan) and compare it to the more radical [Wade-Davis bill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wade%E2%80%93Davis_Bill) he vetoed.\n\nLincoln's successor, Andrew Johnson *vetoed the civil rights act* and had to be overruled by congress for it to be enacted. \n\nRobert E Lee was never even arrested. He and pretty much the rest of the Confederacy was granted full amnesty after the war by Johnson, and when Lee died he was the president of Washington College in Virginia (now Washington and Lee University), rather than rotting in a prison cell for his treason and the deaths of all of the Union soldiers killed by the Confederate army under his command.\n\nI could go on, but you get the idea. You can read through the Wikipedia page on [reconstruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_era) to see how easy the traitorous, secessionist states had it after the war.",

He is consumed with (a) a Napoleon complex, (b) incredibly insecure masculinity (slightly different from (a)), and (c) a desire to exact revenge against someone\u2014anyone\u2014for the collapse of the Soviet empire, with which his own ego in entangled.\n\nThe guy is a bitter childhood bully with a chip on his shoulder. Had he been born dumber and in the U.S., he'd be the angry slob at a Trump rally who nurses a grievance against blacks, gays, and anyone who went to college. But Putin is Russian, and much smarter than that. So he uses his intellect to pursue the same petty, vengeful obsessions. (Dare I say, he's not even that intriguing; you can read him easily.)\n\nAll of which means he'd rather preside over a smoldering, bankrupt empire than suffer the \"humiliation\" of having a prosperous Russia exist in a world where his perceived enemies, the U.S. and Europe, remain as or even more successful. He's just angry and egomaniacal, like some Game of Thrones king.\n\nAnd that means the Russian people will suffer. Congratulations; you now get some economically useless, war-torn territory in Donbas. Meanwhile, you're wasting billions on military games, suffering sanctions, and finding that Europe is finally growing enough spine to reject your main export (not to mention your government is torturing and brutalizing innocent Ukrainians). \n\nHopefully, the Russian oligarchy and the Russian people are starting to realize that Putin has no grand plan, no great strategy to make all of this work out in the end, and that continuing to enable this Napoleonic despot means sacrificing their own interests for his emotional fragility.\n\nIt's time for Vladimir to fall out a window.",

Also don't forget that even though Russia had a dramatically weaker economy, it still managed to compete with the US so hard in the 60's that we literally had a to put a human being on the fucking moon to 'win'. This was also with half the US space budget, and a complete division of effort in the USSR space program. \n\nHere in the US, our government is shit too and we actually have no real voice, and it's getting worse everyday. We're struggling too, but it's hard to see with all of the noise that comes out my country.\n\nHopefully, one day Russia will actually be lead by Russians. Not globalist oligarchs. I hope the same for my country.\n\nDon't let people from the outside tell you that you're shit. You're not. They don't understand your situation. I certainly don't, but I'm rooting for you.

Because again... No Sovereign nation should be told what to do by another. Period. End of Story. We got into this with the whole Nukes in Cuba thing. RUSSIA asked to put nukes their, and they agreed. We fought back. Cuba didnt offer the land to Russia for that outright.   \n\n\n>Of course they want us to come defend them while being apparently unwilling to defend themselves.\n\nNot true, They have already offered hit and run tactics as their best form of fighting because they are VASTLY outnumbered and again, Allies. Help. Allies.\n\n>Their European neighbors should do it. We can't be the policemen of the world forever. \n\nThey are doing it. European countries have offered sanctions as well. Germany is most hurt by the sanctions put in place with the Nord2 Pipeline being cut and now will need to get its Natural gas somewhere else instead of Russia.  You're Right, we can not be the worlds police state forever, which is why we are relying on European allies to also hurt Russia economically. Recently, News has said that we positioned our own US troops in Romania (1,000 upped to 2,000) and Poland (4,500 to 9,000). We are Supporting our Allies, and seeing where things lead and supporting Allies troop forces.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>You're insane if you think Poland would just roll over like that...

I just threw nations bordering Ukraine as \"next targets\", and you suggesting that its no big deal for another country to just annex ANY land is a non-starter for sanctions i find absolutely disgusting. What if Mexico just said they were taking back the land bartered in America's histories? Would you be willing to give up Texas, New Mexico, and California because it was \"Ancient Mexican land?",

I picked one that you cant argue with, but I was wrong, you people will say any nonsense that is logically required for you to be right. Truth and knowledge plays no role but I will try anyway.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLets imagine a world without your prefabricated opinion that western imperialism is good when its against countries which are not currently cooperating with the billionaires.\n\n\"Some country\" just had a bunch of billionaires bribe their government in an effort to destroy their country and make it easier to exploit for profit. That country (the soviet union) does a referendum of all their people in their separate cultural territories. Every territory votes to stay a part of the union, some as high as 80% vote to stay. The corrupt leaders who accepted bribes from the west deny their population their rights and they go ahead and destroy the soviet union in exchange for bribes.\n\nA big state with a unique culture has historically been closer to the west, because the western half of ukraine is of german descent for some reason. The west happily bribes the leaders of ukraine just like those in moscow, and creates a great western capitalist colonial relationship where they loot the country, make lots of money, and the population hates them all very very much. the normal western experience.\n\nThis one went a little far and the people threw the government out with violence. Now its a country in chaos because the western government was so corrupt, so nakedly a robbery with no value to the locals whatsoever.\n\nThe west gives them garbage, they throw it out, and of course the west is still there like \"wow thats real sad what happened, lets help get you back on track\" while there is a gigantic mountain of money right there behind the billionaire offering to help. The stolen loot from the obvious theft that just took place, is sitting right there.\n\nLiterally zero people are not aware of this theft, including all of you liberals. You know that our evil billionaires, who everyone hates, destroyed this country of ukraine until they took revenge on their government.\n\nWhy do you think these very same people are the good guys!!!!!!!!!!! They dont even pump enough oxygen into their jails and the marijuana users get brain damage. They dont do that in evil russia or china.",

Why do you love the billionaires who rule the west so much? Can you please read and respond instead of disrespecting me?\n\nUsually we can all agree that the billionaires are extremely shockingly bad, but as soon as a topic comes up that people dont know anything about, then those same billionaires are the best and we trust them and we love them so much.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDont forget, war takes two parties. I dont love the fact that Russia feels justified in installing a new government there, but what I really hate is when my billionaire masters are taking my tax dollars that should be helping homeless people, to go install a colonial government to help them continue looting the former soviet union.\n\nWhy do you love the billionaires so much!!!!!!!!!",

As he continues punching, he points at a random other person and shouts \"that guy just stepped on my foot by accident, we need to punch him until he dies!\" \n\nThats the billionaires killing several entire countries (including Ukraine in the past few years!!!), also Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria, and lots more! If they care so much about bad governments, maybe they could have bribed one in ukraine that wasnt extremely bad to the point the people overthrew it!\n\ndo you understand? I am telling a story here that is not presented to you on the boomer television news. Absolutely zero of you ridiculous clowns is arguing in any way. You just recite your magical spells that I dont know what you think it will achieve. \"whataboutism! bot!\" just keep saying the words and I will realize yes I am a bot and doing a whataboutism, you win the argument. \n\nJesus Christ please stop murdering children!!!!!",

I myself keep the digital display of my office clock set to GMT, while the [analog hands are set to local time](https://i.imgur.com/pL9jg0G.jpg).  One friend deals extensively with the Tokyo financial markets and keeps his watch on Tokyo time.  Another lives on the west coast but works remotely for the Feds and keeps their watch on east coast time.\n\nMoscow is on GMT +3 time and a 6 hour difference could be GMT +9, which would be the time zone for both Koreas, Japan, etc.  There are any number of valid reasons why they might want to know Tokyo time without having to do mental conversions, while an announcement that affects economics is taking place.",

There will be severe consequences this time. On its eastern front US is stone\u2019s throw away from US. If this escalates into a nuclear contest the world may not live to see another day. All Russia is saying that takes your big guns out of Ukraine ( read don\u2019t add Ukraine to NATO ). To most it may seem like a unjust command given Ukraine is a sovereign nation but so was Cuba when Russia tried to place its Missiles during Cold War. Both of these countries need to be as far from each other as possible and for once US needs to mind it\u2019s own fucking business. If this escalates into a nuclear war it won\u2019t matter whose fault it was! And this time not many will survive to tell stories later!",

Russia got a chance to recognise these regions once US upped the war rhetoric! Biden is literally begging for war since 16 Feb! Give me an example of a country that US invaded or went to help and left in a better shape? We have lost millions of lives in weapons of mass destruction drama earlier! US doesn\u2019t have a good track record to act as the nigh brother! They are there just in personal gains if not they would have first attacked China a country that created and spread a Virus all around the world killing millions and still US has not done anything?
