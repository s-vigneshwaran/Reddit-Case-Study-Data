This lead to me being totally unaware that my coverage was being revoked and the only way I found out was I got a surprise bill for $470 in the mail instead of the usual $100 I paid through the ACA. \n\nThey changed the requirements for proof of income, which screwed over thousands of private contractors because under their \u201crules\u201d we technically couldn\u2019t prove our income (previous years tax returns were rejected with no explanation and we couldn\u2019t provide proof of regular bank deposits with consistent amounts because we don\u2019t MAKE consistent amounts of money from week to week). Every person I worked with in my industry lost healthcare because of this rule. When I called to ask about what I could possibly do I was told \u201chuh\u2026I don\u2019t know. I guess you\u2019ll have to apply again for next year\u201d\n\nOh, and speaking of applying, they reduced the times you could apply for healthcare to 1 time a year, where as previously you could apply at various points throughout the year for various reasons. They also scheduled server maintenance during the weekend of the one month applications were open. So when my healthcare coverage was revoked I had to wait months before I could even try to apply again and I ran into the same problem.\n\nThe fact that you aren\u2019t aware of any of this is exactly how he \u201cgutted\u201d the ACA - slowly, in subtly ways that made it seem like a failure of the system and not a purposeful malicious attempt to make the ACA fail without looking like a bad guy. But I had the ACA for years before Trump and it worked perfectly, easily, and smoothly every year, and it was very obvious for anyone paying attention EXACTLY what the GOP and Trump was trying to do.\n\nAlso I\u2019m not going to go into specific details of my taxes with you, but I owed more money under trump than I did before trump for making a similar amount of money.",

Notably, most of the foreign policy struggles during BOTH of those presidencies either started with Bush or were already ongoing when Bush took office.\n\n>It looks like you're just defending along tribal lines\n\nThe projection is strong here. You saying only Obama got people killed and Trump just insulted people and did no harm to anyone is just an incredibly stupid, false, and partisan statement. I made no such claims.\n\nJust fuck off, you clearly don't want to have an honest discussion.",

In the 14 years since 2008 lots of people love to still criticize his and his administrations choices but no one seems to be able to suggest what he could have done instead.\n\nSometimes all the choices suck - we hope our leaders choose to go with the one that sucks the least.",

At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.\n\n\nBilly Madison quotes aside, there are very very small nuggets of truth in what you said. But you clearly do not understand the sub-prime mortgage crisis or the financial collapse of that time. Many of the deregulation that caused these issues started in the 70s. This is not a democrat vs republican issue. It\u2019s a capitalism and financial/housing/banking/monetary law and policy issue. Politicians are shit, sure, but your statements are so scrambled and full of untrue and misinformed statements, I truly don\u2019t even know where to begin to debate or help you.\n\nEdit: foreclosures had already began in 06. So you\u2019re wrong there. The issue started LONG before 06\n\nMany people in the industry reported this issue before 07, again you\u2019re sorely misinformed that it had anything to do with Dems flipping congress in the midterms\n\nIf you think affirmative action had anything to do with the housing bubble, you know ABSOLUTELY NOTHING of the issue lol\n\nThere start there and start \u201cfeeling\u201d in more information if you like",

Each one probably killed a dozen, and with the US intelligence' accuracy rating in the current millennium, I'm guessing less than 10% were the intended target.\n\nOf course it's impossible to prove a negative, so everyone close to a suspected terrorist (suspected by the people who sold you \"Iraq has WMDs\" mind you) gets labeled a combatant rather than a child, housewife, pupil, because the US controls the narrative.\n\nIn 2012 the US hit 30 - **THIRTY** - civilian homes in Afghanistan, yet they as little as 66 children died to drone strikes in the entire 20 year long occupation. More than 66 children in just those 30 strikes and they admit to conducting more than 13,000.\n\nThere's a famous trick question that goes like this:\n\nWho's the only US President since the start of World War II to not commit any war crimes?\n\nThey are all awful. As horrible as Russia is, it's fucking rich that the US and the UK are pushing to exclude Russia for doing the exact same thing they did in 2003: Lying about a cause to invade a country and murder a bunch of their people in horrific ways.",

He writhes in delight as the sensation washes through him... power growing with each pump siphoned. A moan escapes his lips as he's racked with wave after wave of unholy, fossil-fuel power... gas forms on his skin like dew on morning's grass. It drips from his forehead, trickles from his ears, slicks his hair wet until it shines with combustive potential... His eyes stream tears of diesel, and in their oily sheen, Biden swears that he can see through time itself, see to the vast expanse of American wasteland dwarfed by the sheer concrete pillars of his kingdom-yet-to-be... The wheezing coughs come now as he aspirates gasoline, but he is far beyond the threshold of pain. His irises contract as his sclera achieves octane rating 94. A spark from his desk clock and the oily presidential slug is now become a writhing, seated inferno, and interns at the White House don their headphones as the escalating screaming begins in earnest. \n\n>The flames consume him... They *cleanse* him. \n\n>And across America, consumers weep, for gas prices have raised another cent. \n\n>Thus was as it simply had to be.\n\n-- u/drewhead118",

But Bernie took office January 20th, and the price increases from 3.306 to 3.530 between January 17th and February 21st (closest data from eia.gov I took the price 3 days prior to both events) for a increase of 22.4 cents in 33 days for a derivative of 0.67 cents a day. \n\nRussia obviously increase four gas prices, by a very large margin but so did Biden. The decently high by pre war standards increase to the price of gas prior to the invasion can\u2019t get credited Russia but a penny every 2 days is a fairly large rate of change for gas prices, and while the Russian invasion marks a massive change in the rate that gas is increasing it\u2019s difficult to say from a chart of gas prices alone what caused these numbers, or if Biden\u2019s influence can b a discredited because the pattern number is bigger. After all: Biden Policy is happening for the full duration of both time sets and policy undoubtedly CAN effect gas prices \n\nIt may be difficult to look at a chart and conclude that it\u2019s Biden fault that gas is expensive, even for statisticians. But the large increase before the invasion? That can\u2019t be credited to the invasion. And our price increase post invasion should be smaller than Englands and Australia\u2019s gas prices which see a much faster growth after the invasion and much less before it relative to America.",

But it isn\u2019t as difficult to look through the decisions of Biden and take note of which ones might result in a particular increase or decrease in gas prices. If there are many likely to be significant it wouldn\u2019t be irresponsible to partial credit the gas price increase to him. Here are the ones I noticed but it isn\u2019t a comprehensive list, I also may have overestimated if and by how much these might effect gas prices. \n\n1: Developed new EPA and oil rules that hold oil refineries and extracting to higher standards of methane pollution that forces companies to less efficient methods of refining and extraction oil and natural gas \n\n2: one of his first acts in office was to halt new oil and gas leases on federal land and water. \n\n3: canceled construction of the keystone pipeline (yes I am aware that it was not finished and would not be finished by today but the promise of supply increase in the future is still an effective increase of supply for supply and demand, if the company isn\u2019t at risk of draining their supply) \n\n4: rejoined Paris Agreement. Which, admittedly is probably a good call, but it still increases gas prices seeing as gas prices went down after leaving it.  \n\n5: the EOA is trying to restrict the exportation of crude oil, they haven\u2019t yet, but since simply and demand focuses on future supply an attempt or promise can effect prices. \n\n6: the Build Back Better agenda in the green new Deal includes a new tax on natural gas extraction, home heating, and a separate new tax on petroleum manufacturing, which of course raises prices by raising the price needed to manufacture gas. \n\n7: the clean electrified standard adds a new tax to several companies (even more aggressively than Obama\u2019s green new deal) that generate electricity from sources that generate green house gases. These companies often have alliances or deals with their providers so that if their expenditure goes up for some reason, oil prices will raise for the rest of America but them, so that oil can be provided to make electricity cheep. \nThough way more complicated than I can claim to understand these deals generally serve to make gas prices less stable than energy prices and make gas prices effected by policy that effects the price of energy instead of the price of energy. For example If the price to make gas goes up it doesn\u2019t go up for energy companies that make energy for gas it just goes up more for people who drive cars and if energy companies get a new fine that makes electricity more expensive to make the price of gas goes up instead \n\nAll he did to lower it was release oil from the federal reserve and ask companies to release oil from their own reserve, but as mentioned: supply and demand is focused on a long term supply, since there\u2019s enough immediate supply to sell all of in the next 20 years the supply of oil in the next 20 years will lower the prices and releasing oil from the reserve will have a reduced impact compared to extracting new oil since that\u2019s just taking oil from the next 20 years and making it oil today. Biden even discredits this decision as not much by calling it \u201ca drop in the ocean\u201d \n\n\nAlone the fact that the oil and gas prices went up before Russia had any sanctions should disprove the idea that Russia alone is the reason gas prices are up so high now. \n\nBiden has made several decisions, that can be credited to increasing gas prices often in an attempt to move America forward to cleaner energy and transportation, which you know, might be a good thing, but it\u2019s independent from the argument that Biden didn\u2019t do anything that would raise gas prices. meanwhile he did very little to lower gas prices to compensate for the economic devastation onto America and Europe that is the Russian invasion. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to tell how much of our gas prices is Russia and how much is Biden, and how much is non political variables, especially since many of these decisions aren\u2019t decisions that were made between January 20th and February 22, and Domestic, geopolitical, and non political variables are all increasing gas prices at the same time. so the large calculated difference in the rate of change for gas prices might not be the war\u2019s doing alone, but you really shouldn\u2019t discredit that these policy do increase gas prices.",

Things like increasing size, raising them higher above water for offshore, and painting some of the blades black. I think offshore windfarms are the solution, but price is the biggest factor. Hopefully that changes in the near future. I don't think people mind the scenery of offshore farm much either.\n\nI think solar right now is pretty viable, price wise. But with more investment, it could get much cheaper. [It is one of the cheapest sources of energy to build.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_electricity_by_source) It may surprise you how viable rooftop solar is right now (maybe not now, now, with shortages and such). The real problem with solar is what do we do at night. That's why we need more research for storage methods.\n\nI agree there are still a lot of problems with batteries. Seems like the current focus for industry is capacity. There are a bunch of alternative battery chemistries in the research phase, but they are not ready yet. Batteries may not be good yet, but they will get there. Their current state is better for the environment than oil.\n\nAs for nuclear, I agree that it is the best option. However, it is just too late. They take 20 years to construct, so even if they started building 1000 of them tomorrow, they wouldn't be ready until after 2040. I wish they would start building them tomorrow, but looking at the public opinions, we may be 5 years away from even starting construction. Some countries are closing down nuclear plants even now.",

Trees dying and falling over are what fuels the ecosystems that are forests. Also, if humans are gone, the bees will be fine.\n\n> Or the soil they grow in being permanently filled with heavy metals? \n\nFungi and bacteria will move in to remove that from the soil, just like they always have. Plants don't really care. maybe about plutonium or uranium or something, but not the rest.\n\nWhat humans are doing is screwing up the stuff that humans need to survive in all the places on earth. Eventually, if we don't stop screwing around, there's going to be uninhabitable bands around the planet, similar to before the last ice age unfrosted.\n\nAnd if all humans are dead, i don't really care what happens after that, i'm just saying there's no way to completely eradicate even a significant fraction of life on the planet. In about a decade, you wouldn't even know from a cursory glance that anything else ever lived here.",

If, for instance, there was a lack of lactobacteria (which is everywhere) then other bacteria could thrive instead. Everything is just waiting its turn. Bacteria that eat plastic exist, and would hopefully be able to outcompete other bacteria wherever there is plastic. Mushrooms and their cohort of little helpers won't die off because of a little pollution or even a lot, really. they're only above ground to shoot their spores in the air.\n\nDid you know that a leading theory of \"why are there clouds everywhere instead of just silty/sandy areas?\" is that fungal spores get blown around and convect up, allowing ice to form around them  up wherever they make clouds at?\n\nI'll be a little conspiratorial for a second: Why have there been 3+ major storms in the south central and eastern US in the past 5 weeks? It's uncommon, i've been asking the old timers and they don't remember this many tornado alerts since that pager/emergency alert thing was implemented. They're all coming from the pacific, and hit california first. Is it possible another country just started some \"new manufacturing process\" that is throwing tons of particulates in the air, and we're just \"down wind\" as it were?\n\nI don't think HAARP can control the weather, BTW!",

To be fair, he was sort of \u201cduped\u201d. The Ukrainian delegation that included folks like Georgetown\u2019s adjunct assistant-professor Dr. Phillip Karber, they were the ones that sent the \u201calready printed\u201d photographs over. But still, when asked about the discrepancies, Donelle Harder, Inhofe's communications director, said, \u201c*We thoroughly checked our sources again prior to releasing the photos, and felt confident proceeding because the photos also match reporting*\u201d.\n\nCompletely inept. No wonder these fools believe such dumb shit, they\u2019re easy to fool. It\u2019s also no wonder they\u2019re falling to foreign influence like they are. U.S. intelligence isn\u2019t allowed to run influence operations on their own government and citizens, but others essentially can. So when only one angle of operations is being run on you, odds are they\u2019re going to get their objectives sooner or later though some number of targets.",

This is fine since both of those other means of travelling will actually get you where you want to go.\n\nThe prices can be high for whatever reason, but I would guess it's taxes much higher, so that more people use other means to travel. That way you don't have NY subway level issues with other travellers.\n\nGet this, gas is twice as expensive in Los Angeles than where I live in Louisiana, even though it's \"the same gas\", but they have busses and rail and Uber and yellow cabs.\n\nAnd the reason CA is more expensive is the state taxes on fuel.\n\nOregon has cheaper gas, but as soon as hybrid and electrics hit the roads they found a problem - gas taxes couldn't pay for road maintenance anymore, even considering that large vehicles use more gas and therefore pay more tax. \n\nSo OR solved this by charging more to register electric or pEV/fEV. Because Oregonians would riot if their gas went up because of Portland hippies.",

But I don't think any Australians see Australia as \"the whole world\". And we have the same lead poisoning and aggressive right wing media issues.\n\nI think the difference is that the US is *the* global world power. Culturally, politically and militarily, it kind of *is* the centre of the world. \n\nIf we lived in 50 BC, then everyone in the far corners of the Roman empire would want to know what's going on in Rome, because that would be relevant to their lives. But very few people in Rome would care about what's happening in, say, Spain. Because that generally wouldn't be relevant to their lives.\n\nSame thing today. The whole world watches the US because we need to know. A change in, say, the US President can have an impact on the whole world. But does a change in the Prime Minister of Australia have any real impact on the US? Probably not. So the US doesn't have to pay as much attention to the rest of the world.

Which is the main reason anyone needs anything. It's like me saying \"I don't need a job, I just need the money it gives me\". That means I *do* need a job.\n\nAlso, there's plenty of other things the US gives us (ie the rest of the western world) other than money. They give us resources (they are one of the world's largest oil producers for example) and, probably most importantly, security. \n\nWithout the US, a lot of countries would be pushed around by Russia and China. Just look at Ukraine. What do you think stopped the Russian invasion? The helmets the Germans sent? No, it was US missiles, and US money and US training. And what will rebuild Ukraine after Russia gets kicked out again? US loans and US resources.\n\nTo be clear, I don't like Americans any more than you do. But the reality is, we need them. We need their money, their armed forces and their technology. And they know it, which, I suspect, is at least partly why they behave the way they do.",

In both cases, people who had jobs, ones they were trained and good at were immediately fired and replaced with the guys getting back.

Unless you decrease supply so sharply that people panic buy, supply and demand don't depend on each other, but on factors that affect consumers or suppliers, respectively. Demand is influenced by things like how much people want to travel, or have to travel. It was low during the pandemic and picked back up. When demand increases, even if the supply remains the same, the price will increase because the intersection between the supply and demand curves will fall higher on the price axis. Similarly, if supply decreases and demand remains the same, the price increases. Supply is influenced by things like wars, extraction tech, etc. \n\nWhat has happened is both- the supply has decreased do to geopolitical shit storm, and the demand has increased as the pandemic restrictions are lifted.",

Right now, Biden is talking about using the Defense Production Act to increase domestic production of battery components. Dependence on foreign (read: Chinese) batteries is bad for national security; dependence on foreign oil is arguably worse because oil is significantly more important right now than batteries.",

Just repeating what your shepherds told you \ud83d\udc11\n\n>11) Forcing States to restrict driving, this through the Jobs Act which requires States to carbon reduction plans every four years at a cost of billions for each State and to be submitted to Federal Transportation regulators in order to reduce driving in each State. 12) Increase the new CAFE standards fines from $4.50 to $12.00 for ever 1/10th of mile over Standard raising the cost of cars on average $800. to $1,000. making it more difficult for low earning people to buy a new more efficient vehicle. 13) Increased the Carbon tax on wholesale electric providers raising costs of fuel to create electricity.\n\nYaaaaaaaaaaaaa, not going to take your word on that. A source would be nice. Because that all sounds completely made up, or completely out of context. \n\n>Raised the fine of Carbon emissions from $1. to $51 per ton.\n\nHow would that have *anything* to do with the price of gas? Also, a source would be nice because I couldn't find it anywhere online. \n\n>New and very strict regulations on all Electric generation.\n\n\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 Like what?\n\n\nThis sounds like you've been listening to alot of propaganda by big oil and you believe every word of it \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\nAnd not a single source in sight.

              "text": "\"In the months leading up to the Covid-19 pandemic, U.S. oil production hit an all-time high of just below 13 million barrels per day (BPD). As the pandemic unfolded, demand collapsed, and production followed. By May 2020, oil production had dropped by more than 3 million BPD to 9.7 million BPD. Since then, demand has recovered to pre-pandemic levels. Oil production, however, has only partially recovered. The most recent data available from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) shows current U.S. oil production at ~11.6 million BPD \u2014 still 1.4 million BPD short of pre-pandemic production. This shortfall is a major factor that led to the run-up of oil and gasoline prices over the past year.\" https://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2022/03/11/what-is-holding-back-us-oil-production/\n\nOil Production fell dramatically in 2020. Biden was NOT President in 2020. Since Biden has taken office Oil Production has been rising. Up from 9.7 million BPD to 11.6 million BPD. The belief that Biden has cut production is rooted in propaganda pushed by those who oppose the Biden Administration. \n\n\nAlso want to point out that gas and oil companies in the U.S. are also currently experiencing **record high profits**.\nhttps://www.reuters.com/business/energy/exxon-signals-record-quarterly-profit-oil-gas-prices-2022-04-04/",

People started driving less, the demand for oil dropped, which caused smaller oil companies to go out of business. This created shortages in labor and production. Oil Companies are producing less now because they can't get their production levels back up to 2020 levels. This has nothing to do with Biden.  \n\n\nMaybe you should stop talking about economics and take a basic business class.",

              "text": "> This is because America is one of the largest producers (and consumers) in the entire world.\n\nAmerican production of crude oil has returned, after a pandemic-induced slump (remember when oil futures briefly went negative?), to late-2018 levels. The price of gas is higher than it was in 2018. \n\n>Whenever a country which produces oil reduces their production, prices rise. \n\nThis is quite obviously not true. We (collectively, Americans) cut production in the pandemic because there was a huge slump in demand. Production hasn't yet rebounded, even though demand apparently has. It's the relationship between supply and demand that determines price, not solely supply. And when we talk about supply of a commodity, we really mean \"aggregate supply,\" not a single country or single firm's supply. \n\nThe Biden administration has been / is hostile to new oil projects, but those projects all take several years to build and oil companies were holding back new investment due to the pandemic anyway until late last year. So it's not the cause of high gas prices right now.\n\nThe single biggest causes of high gas prices are (1) an economy where everyone who wants a job can get one, easily, leading to significantly greater demand, and (2) investor panic over Russia's war in Ukraine causing a global rise in crude prices, which in turn caused prices at the pump to rise.",

Time in the market is fantastic if you are buying the whole market or a large chunk of it (ie.

There are just a lot of things that make no sense.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy mind started changing on this when I drove semi's. Our company had to install these special hubcaps that reduced drag or face fines. The thing is they saved somewhere in the equivilant of  $100 a month in gas but cost $120 per month when all was said and done. Plus the fine was $110 (again I don't remember the specific prices but the ratios are close and it may have been that the second year the fine increased, I wasn't smart enough to ask back then). That isn't even counting the fact they get lost or wear out prematuerely. That's in a perfect situation where you get the full use of them. The hilarious part is when you realize they were thick plastic (that I'm sure had a large environmental impact to make and recycle/dispose of) and were a road hazard if they fell off.\n\nIt's not a bad thing to try to consider how we affect the earth but...it has to be feasible how we get it done. It's like electric cars. The batteries cause farm more impact on the environment to make and there is no disposing of them safely and they are a huge hazard if you have an accident.\n\nGas isn't the best but there is not another fuel source (that I know of) that you can get the same amount of energy per weight distribution.\n\nAll this to say, there are options for more oil locally, but people are getting in the way in a misguided plea for environmental concerns. Instead we are importing oil?? Using up a ton of fuel to get it here?? Risking the ship sinking or oil spilling like BP did a few years ago really badly?? It just makes no sense.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAgain, it's only a portion of the problem. But noone can deny it is a significant portion.",

You'd amortize the cost ($1440) out to 12 months of useful life to get $120 PER MONTH cost and compare with the savings of $100 PER MONTH. So you are taking a $20 hit each month.\n\nOR you can just pay the fine, which would equate to $110 a month. Now, to be fair though, I don't remember if the fine would have increased for the second year or not. I don't think I even asked, but I do know there are cases where if you are out of compliance for multiple years in a row the fine can even double.\n\nSo, basically, it's a well meaning piece of legislation to help pollute the air less, but in  all practicality it just isn't feasible economically. And, as with so many of these things, the smaller businesses that are skating by on a very slim profit margin already are hurt the most.\n\nIt isn't so much people don't like the idea of being more responsible as ... it just has to make sense. It has to be a viable solution that actually helps the environment, for one, and can be done without putting people out of business that can't absorb the cost.",

Putin would see both events as very lucrative and convenient for Russia and its relation with Brazil, but other than interest there wasn't any proof to suggest they intervened.\n\nWhat I do see is a very heavy interest of the wealthy in Brazil to elect a conservative like Bolsonaro. Farm owners, for example, thrived heavily on his election and lack of environmental concern, and some corruption investigations such as \"O gabinete do \u00f3dio\" (The hatred cabinet) are linking focal points of misinformation spreading to big entrepreneurs such as Havan's owner (Havan is a Brazilian big supermarket corp).\n\nI fully believe Russia's finger would be in Brexit and the US elections. There is much to gain meddling with the pivots of the international stage.\n\nBut doing it in Brazil? I don't think so.\n\nOr maybe I'm wrong.",

Kaliningrad Oblast could be given back to Germany. The book uses the term \"Moscow\u2013Berlin axis\".[9]\n    France should be encouraged to form a bloc with Germany, as they both have a \"firm anti-Atlanticist tradition\".[9]\n    The United Kingdom, merely described as an \"extraterritorial floating base of the U.S.\", should be cut off from Europe.[9]\n    Finland should be absorbed into Russia. Southern Finland will be combined with the Republic of Karelia and northern Finland will be \"donated to Murmansk Oblast\".[9]\n    Estonia should be given to Germany's sphere of influence.[9]\n    Latvia and Lithuania should be given a \"special status\" in the Eurasian\u2013Russian sphere.[9]\n    Poland should be granted a \"special status\" in the Eurasian sphere.[9]\n    Romania, North Macedonia, Serbia, \"Serbian Bosnia\" and Greece \u2013 \"Orthodox collectivist East\" \u2013 will unite with \"Moscow the Third Rome\" and reject the \"rational-individualistic West\".[9]\n    Ukraine should be annexed by Russia because \"Ukraine as a state has no geopolitical meaning, no particular cultural import or universal significance, no geographic uniqueness, no ethnic exclusiveness, its certain territorial ambitions represents an enormous danger for all of Eurasia and, without resolving the Ukrainian problem, it is in general senseless to speak about continental politics\". Ukraine should not be allowed to remain independent, unless it is cordon sanitaire, which would be inadmissible.[9]\n\nIn the Middle East and Central Asia:\n\n    The book stresses the \"continental Russian\u2013Islamic alliance\" which lies \"at the foundation of anti-Atlanticist strategy\". The alliance is based on the \"traditional character of Russian and Islamic civilization\".\n    Iran is a key ally. The book uses the term \"Moscow\u2013Tehran axis\".[9]\n    Armenia has a special role: It will serve as a \"strategic base,\" and it is necessary to create \"the [subsidiary] axis Moscow-Yerevan-Teheran\". Armenians \"are an Aryan people ... [like] the Iranians and the Kurds\".[9]\n    Azerbaijan could be \"split up\" or given to Iran.[9]\n    Georgia should be dismembered. Abkhazia and \"United Ossetia\" (which includes Georgia's South Ossetia) will be incorporated into Russia. Georgia's independent policies are unacceptable.[9]\n    Russia needs to create \"geopolitical shocks\" within Turkey. These can be achieved by employing Kurds, Armenians and other minorities.[9]\n    The book regards the Caucasus as a Russian territory, including \"the eastern and northern shores of the Caspian (the territories of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan)\" and Central Asia (mentioning Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan).[9]\n\nIn East and Southeast Asia:\n\n    China, which represents a danger to Russia, \"must, to the maximum degree possible, be dismantled\". Dugin suggests that Russia start by taking Tibet\u2013Xinjiang\u2013Inner Mongolia\u2013Manchuria as a security belt.[1] Russia should offer China help \"in a southern direction \u2013 Indochina (except Vietnam), the Philippines, Indonesia, Australia\" as geopolitical compensation.[9]\n    Russia should manipulate Japanese politics by offering the Kuril Islands to Japan and provoking anti-Americanism.[9]\n    Mongolia should be absorbed into Eurasia-Russia.[9]\n\nThe book emphasizes that Russia must spread anti-Americanism everywhere: \"the main 'scapegoat' will be precisely the U.S.\"\n\nIn the United States:\n\n    Russia should use its special services within the borders of the United States to fuel instability and separatism, for instance, provoke \"Afro-American racists\". Russia should \"introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements \u2013 extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in American politics\".[9]\n\nThe Eurasian Project could be expanded to South and Central America.[9]",

As the pandemic unfolded, demand collapsed, and production followed. By May 2020, oil production had dropped by more than 3 million BPD to 9.7 million BPD. Since then, demand has recovered to pre-pandemic levels. Oil production, however, has only partially recovered. The most recent data available from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) shows current U.S. oil production at ~11.6 million BPD \u2014 still 1.4 million BPD short of pre-pandemic production. This shortfall is a major factor that led to the run-up of oil and gasoline prices over the past year.\" https://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2022/03/11/what-is-holding-back-us-oil-production/\n\nOil Production fell dramatically in 2020. Biden was NOT President in 2020. Since Biden has taken office Oil Production has been rising. Up from 9.7 million BPD to 11.6 million BPD. The belief that Biden has cut production is rooted in propaganda pushed by those who oppose the Biden Administration. \n\n\nAlso want to point out that gas and oil companies in the U.S. are also currently experiencing **record high profits**.\nhttps://www.reuters.com/business/energy/exxon-signals-record-quarterly-profit-oil-gas-prices-2022-04-04/",

Demand dropped so far that oil prices were negative for a little bit; really interesting shit, it\u2019s never happened before then, IIRC.\n\n>Why then did prices go down rather than up?\n\nAs I said, oil prices were down. Down so far that many oil companies were looking at laying off thousands of workers; there was literally too much oil in the market. Trump held a meeting with OPEC in 2020, who were engaged in essentially an oil war with Russia at the time (mostly the Saudis vs. Russia), and convinced them to cut production and thus increase the price of oil enough to where US producers didn\u2019t have to completely shut down. \n\nNow that COVID is pretty much over with, demand for oil is back to where it was pre-pandemic. However, with demand back to normal levels OPEC, as a cartel, is able to get the most out of keeping oil prices sky high by they themselves not increasing production.",

You seem to be discussing in good faith and i appreciate that, So, fair warning, prepare for a wall of text. \n\nto answer your question about contract duration, the duration of the leases is 10 years, with current leasees being in what is called \"first position\" when the contract ends. what this means is that the current leasee is given a chance to renew their current leases without any competing bids. if they decide not to renew and the bidding process resumes, the former leasee can be compensated for most if not all \"improvements\" (which are known as appurtenant assets) that they have installed/constructed on the leased property. things like roads and other infrastructure. \n\nfurthermore, you hear the word \"New\" used a lot in the discussion of the leasing process in reference to exploration/drilling. this is important because when we get a new administration or there is a change in policy, that word is used to delineate between what is already in progress and any, well, \"New\" venture. so, even if they haven't put a single shovel in thr ground, so long as they can show that they have secured/allocated funding or especially if they've already submitted plans to the department of energy/department of the interior, and there is a sudden sea change in policy, these things will not be affected. they are protected by the previous agreements. This is all in service of insulating energy companies from financial risk of the volatility of the political climate and guaranteeing that committments are honored. obviously, there are specific cases that can delay this process, but those usually come with arbitration clauses that don't have to go through the court system. what you're seeing now with the current pause is actually the result of a lawsuit against the biden administration, the pause is because the oil producers/states sued. not because biden just hates oil.\n\nfun fact - biden actually issued more permits than trump, before the lawsuit caused this pause. \n\n>You know its always profit not a lack if immediate workers/drilled profitable wells and contracts with tanker trains?\n\nAbsolutely, that's why i brought it up. one metric that further illustrates my point about the current prices vs whether or not we're really producing enough is to look at the overall refining capacity vs production of the petroleum sector. this is basically how much crude can be processed, vs how much is actually being processed. production has remained at or near 100% of refining capacity for the last ten years, even during the slow down. what's more? refining capacity has only increased by about 1% each year over this time. so, ask yourself. if the problem was that we're not producing enough crude, and they say they want more, why haven't they expanded their capacity to actually process more crude? short answer - it's not a problem with the amount of crude production. it's simply a matter of profit. they don't need to produce more, building the infrastructure to do so isn't actually profitable by their calculations and they show this with their actions. \n\nIf you're still with me, Let me expound on my points in reference to what people like to throw around as \"Energy independence.\" and why our energy sector's actions seem to suggest they're actually not all that worried about such a thing. \n\nThe refineries in the gulf coast are equipped to process what is known as \"sour crude\", it's a particular type of crude with a sulfur content above 0.5%, sweet crude being below that threshold. (there are other factors of course but this is just a good baseline for the scope of this conversation.) The U.s. oil reserve mostly contain sweet crude... yet our refineries are geared to mostly process sour crude, which is found in the middle east. So tell me, Why are our refineries mostly geared to process oil which can only be imported, when they're claiming they want more domestic drilling?\n\nAnswer - profit. It'll always be more profitable to import. opec nations have gone all or nothing on oil production and export. the U.S. with a more diverse energy ecosystem will never be able to compete with that and the energy companies know it. So, if you want to know when i'll be convinced that our domestic energy companies are sincere in their claim that they want to work towards energy independence, and that they actually NEED more leasing and drilling? I'll believe when they act like it, like say, adding to their refining capacity for sweet crude. until then, all they're doing is buying leases to PREVENT more domestic production. their actions show this.\n\nThank you for coming to my ted talk and i hope you have a good day! \n\nNinja edit: also, like i said, you seem to be genuine in your discussion, so feel free to ask any more questions/argue any of my points/whatever.",

I was sincere and appreciate the trust you had in me and the time you took to write this! \n\nI do still have questions but I will keep it to here is what I have been told and you can respond or you can leave it where you did. Again I appreciate the time. \n\n My dad was a pipe fitter till 2010ish. His sticking points with refinery capacity is that no one would let them build another stinky/polluting refinery. And that is from a neutral perspective.   So all they can do is maintain and build in the areas they have. Maybe they can add a tower or two but no more additional sites; at least anywhere even near any sort of decent population. \n\nNow hes no longer with us; and the \u2018fitters\u2019 were striking in my area. And I asked them a bit about the refineries. They claimed the refineries nearby have cleaned up a ton in the last decade, that they havent had a net additional polluting release in years. I mean they were protesting the plants cutting them so why would they lie positively about the refineries unless they believed it to be true? \n\nI was surprised yet I figured anything is possible, and what do I know? So maybe they have completely closed-loop the system or neutralized all outputs. And if they did well maybe then they could get additional refining locations. \n\nNow you mention; the refining capacity is the limit. And I have zero reason to question it. But finally heres my question: \n\nIs the reason for failure to increase refining capacity similar to the difficulty in creating \u2018new\u2019 pipelines. I see reports of only getting permits to maintain or maybe equally replace current infrastructure, but new lines like XL are basically a shot for the moon and hardly worth the effort to try for, let alone worth the billions it costs even if you were to succeed.",

This was a decrease compared to the previous year, when spending had peaked at 1.2 billion U.S. dollars. Research and development expenditure in the oil and gas industry is not as high as in some other major industries. For example, the chemical industry spends around three percent of its revenue for R&D purposes. Pharmaceutical companies spend even more \u2013 often between 15 and 20 percent. Meanwhile, ExxonMobil's operating revenues were over 170-times higher than its R&D spending.\u201d (https://www.statista.com/statistics/281239/research-and-development-costs-of-exxon-mobil/)\n\nSupply and demand always exist when life is present.

This was a decrease compared to the previous year, when spending had peaked at 1.2 billion U.S. dollars. Research and development expenditure in the oil and gas industry is not as high as in some other major industries. For example, the chemical industry spends around three percent of its revenue for R&D purposes. Pharmaceutical companies spend even more \u2013 often between 15 and 20 percent. Meanwhile, ExxonMobil\u2019s operating revenues were over 170-times higher than its R&D spending.\u201d (https://www.statista.com/statistics/281239/research-and-development-costs-of-exxon-mobil/)\n\nSupply and demand always exist when life is present.

These have become notoriously slow since the pandemic started so supply had been further cut.\n\nLastly, most of those permits you're referring to are held by smaller drilling companies so this entirely isn't a case of Exxon extorting supply chain issues. These are small (often local) companies unable to take advantage of high prices because of a host of factors.\n\nThese are complex issues and while I agree Biden can't turn a price knob, he is certainly not doing anything to help alleviate the issues plaguing domestic production.",

Your feeling that it HAS to be spending is obviously the only reason. \n\nIf you knew anything about economics you'd know that large-scale spending is required to get us out of recessions/depressions. Without those stimulus packages the economy would be ruined right now. You guys love to talk about how important small business is, well those PPP loans are the only reason many businesses stayed afloat. My stepdad took one for his law office, i know firsthand how important they are. Without the stimulus packages the economy would be in ruins and tons of regular people would be even worse off than they already are.\n\nBut again, low interest rates are the biggest reason for inflation right now, not spending. Read the article I gave you, it explains it thoroughly. When interest rates are low, there is more spending, leading to the price of goods increasing. Combine that with the supply chain shortage and worker scarcity and you get what we're seeing right now. That's why the FED is talking about aggressively raising rates which would be good for inflation but bad for economic growth, hence why investors are selling and the market is fluctuating.\n\nSo yes, inflation was spiking before the war, but primarily for the other 3 reasons I gave you and not spending, the war exacerbated already existing issues.",

But my take is that it would be foolish to say that Putin isn\u2019t to blame at all it\u2019s also foolish to say that Biden isn\u2019t even partially to blame. \n\n\nHow much gas has actually gone up: \nsince American and European sanctions in February the price of gas has gone up from Russia\u2019s invasion on February 24th a price of 3.608 average according to EIA.gov, to todays 4.170 average a price increase of about 56.2 cents in 13 days for derivative of 4.3 cents increase per day. But Bernie took office January 20th, and the price increases from 3.306 to 3.530 between January 17th and February 21st (closest data from eia.gov I took the price 3 days prior to both events) for a increase of 22.4 cents in 33 days for a derivative of 0.67 cents a day. \n\nRussia obviously increase four gas prices, by a very large margin but so did Biden. The decently high by pre war standards increase to the price of gas prior to the invasion can\u2019t get credited Russia but a penny every 2 days is a fairly large rate of change for gas prices, and while the Russian invasion marks a massive change in the rate that gas is increasing it\u2019s difficult to say from a chart of gas prices alone if Biden is to blame for either of these numbers and by how much. After all: Biden Policy is happening for the full duration of both time sets and policy undoubtedly CAN effect gas prices \n\nIt may be difficult to look at a chart and conclude that it\u2019s Biden fault that gas is expensive, even for statisticians. But it isn\u2019t as difficult to look through the decisions of Biden and take note of which ones might result in a particular increase or decrease in gas prices. Here are the ones I noticed but it isn\u2019t a comprehensive list, I also may have overestimated if and by how much these might effect gas prices. \n\n1: Developed new EPA and oil rules that hold oil refineries and extracting to higher standards of methane pollution that forces companies to less efficient methods of refining and extraction oil and natural gas \n\n2: one of his first acts in office was to halt new oil and gas leases on federal land and water. \n\n3: canceled construction of the keystone pipeline (yes I am aware that it was not finished and would not be finished by today but the promise of supply increase in the future is still an effective increase of supply for supply and demand, if the company isn\u2019t at risk of draining their supply) \n\n4: rejoined Paris Agreement. Which, admittedly is probably a good call, but it still increases gas prices seeing as gas prices went down after leaving it.  \n\n5: the EOA is trying to restrict the exportation of crude oil, they haven\u2019t yet, but since simply and demand focuses on future supply an attempt or promise can effect prices. \n\n6: the Build Back Better agenda in the green new Deal includes a new tax on natural gas extraction, home heating, and a separate new tax on petroleum manufacturing, which of course raises prices by raising the price needed to manufacture gas. \n\n7: the clean electrified standard adds a new tax to several companies (even more aggressively than Obama\u2019s green new deal) that generate electricity from sources that generate green house gases. These companies often have alliances or deals with their providers so that if their expenditure goes up for some reason, oil prices will raise for the rest of America but them, so that oil can be provided to make electricity cheep. \nThough way more complicated than I can claim to understand these deals generally serve to make gas prices less stable than energy prices and make gas prices effected by policy that effects the price of energy instead of the price of energy. For example If the price to make gas goes up it doesn\u2019t go up for energy companies that make energy for gas it just goes up more for people who drive cars and if energy companies get a new fine that makes electricity more expensive to make the price of gas goes up instead \n\nAll he did to lower it was release oil from the federal reserve and ask companies to release oil from their own reserve, but as mentioned: supply and demand is focused on a long term supply, since there\u2019s enough immediate supply to sell all of in the next 20 years the supply of oil in the next 20 years will lower the prices and releasing oil from the reserve will have a reduced impact compared to extracting new oil since that\u2019s just taking oil from the next 20 years and making it oil today. Biden even discredits this decision as not much by calling it \u201ca drop in the ocean\u201d \n\n\nAlone the fact that the oil and gas prices went up before Russia had any sanctions should disprove the idea that Russia alone is the reason gas prices are up so high now. \n\nBiden has made several decisions, that can be credited to increasing gas prices often in an attempt to move America forward to cleaner energy and transportation, which you know, might be a good thing, but it\u2019s independent from the argument that Biden didn\u2019t do anything that would raise gas prices. meanwhile he did very little to lower gas prices to compensate for the economic devastation onto America and Europe that is the Russian invasion. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to tell how much of our gas prices is Russia and how much is Biden, and how much is non political variables, especially since many of these decisions aren\u2019t decisions that were made between January 20th and February 22, and Domestic, geopolitical, and non political variables are all increasing gas prices at the same time. so the large calculated difference in the rate of change for gas prices might not be the war\u2019s doing alone, but you really shouldn\u2019t discredit that these policy do increase gas prices. \n\nEven if you think they might be good policy for other reasons, Biden is undoubtedly increasing gas prices in a geopolitical time frame where that is a terrible idea to do because one of the worlds top exporters of gas has become a hostile power. I\u2019m not gonna make claims about how much the increased price of gas is who\u2019s fault, but I will say that policy that might increase gas prices is not currently a good idea and it\u2019s not unreasonable to hold THAT against Biden or to say that Biden has contributed to increased gas prices",

While I knew policies had been enacted that could affect pricing, I was not aware of all you have listed. \nMy stance is still that corporate greed has a much bigger impact on our price at the pump than Biden or even Putin for that matter. It is obviously still a very complex topic, but when ppl could really use a break, it\u2019s politicians that seem to get all the blame and not the corporations. Especially as you mention, perceived future supply affects price, these companies can simply \u201canticipate\u201d unfavorable issues arising and hike prices. \nIdeally, I think, policies could be placed that incentivize better renewable energy production and decrease demand on oil.

                      "text": "Obviously actually incorporating nuclear and solar into our grid at a wider rate is the ideal solution since renewable resources (or resources so energy rich that our current supply can fulfill our electricity needs for the next quarter million years) will be far more resistant to the effects of geopolitics on supply and demand than oil, which has become a foundational commodity in what countries are allied to what and how. But I kinda detest the corporate greed argument. Yeah corporate greed is corporations doing some pretty unethical stuff at the expense of America and making a lot of money doing it but corporate greed is a constant. Prices do not go up, let alone double, because corporate greed has changed over the last 3 months. \n\nOn a pretty basic level of economics the price of an object is determined by supply, demand, and competition. Supply is the cost needed to make one unit of product: determined by the cost and plentitude of its components and how they interact with supply and demand, and it represents the minimum amount a product can be sold for. demand is how many units you sell as a function of the set price, and competition effects demand so that increasing the price lowers demand to a greater degree. \n\nA company will always, and has always for hundreds of years, look at these variables, do math, and sell their product at the price that produces the most profit. In an ideal world a company will always sell just above the minimum amount needed for profit to maximize ethics while making an acceptable product but in practice they never will, because the largest and most successful and most influential organizations never do, so market value tends to be what is the most profitable price to sell things at. They always have and always will sell product at the most profitable price even mom and pops small businesses sell at what they think is the most profitable price, not the most ethical. \n\nLuckily The higher the supply and the higher the competition and the lower the demand the closer the most profitable price is to the minimum price they can sell a product for. But it\u2019s not any less greedy for 1 company to sell product A with a 1% mark up because that\u2019s the most profitable price than for another to sell product B: at a 500% mark up for the exact same reason unless company B bribed their local legislature  to put in legislation favorable to their company specifically in order to artificially reduce competition and allow a bigger mark up\n\nThat \u201ccorporate greed\u201d is problematic. When a large influential company throws money at their competition and or politicians to artificially reduce competition either by deciding \u201cyour company doesn\u2019t exist\u201d \u201conly our company can sell here\u201d or in most cases \u201cwe decide what your company sells stuff at\u201d. \nArtificially reducing competition so they can sell their product for more. \n\nThis is a major problem right now for glasses, diamonds, the housing market, medicine, and ink for printers, guns, leather, entertainment and many more American industries as companies get bigger and politics and smaller companies get easier to influence. It\u2019s the main flaw of capitalism.\n\n but thanks to my favorite president guess which one (it\u2019s FDR), companies that sell oil and steel are more restricted from engaging in this artificial manipulation of competition than basically every other industry. And if there is some mechanism by which gas companies are artificially reducing competition that emerged it\u2019s ugly head in the last year I do not know I have not found it please enlighten me. But there are plenty of things that have reduced supply over the last year and many of them are due to Biden policy. \n\nWe can\u2019t really blame \u201ccorporate greed\u201d for a change that happened in the last year unless the corporation is doing something other than set the price of the product at the most profitable level. \n\nBut they aren\u2019t. \n\nIf they were: we would expect to see a spike in their profits and the value of their stocks as they raise prices to nearly more profitable levels. \n\nBut if you look up the stock of your local gas station you will either see it not correlated with the recently increased price, or having a negative correlation. Sure correlation isn\u2019t evidence of causation but a lack of correlation is evidence against causation. \n\nIf corporate greed is to blame why would the corporations be making decisions that actually reduced their profits? \n\nCorporate greed did not increase supply demand and competition changed, and they did so at the expense of both the oil and gas companies and the consumers who buy from them.",

It takes 2-3 years to set up an oil rig.  If Biden had approved 100% of the permits since day one instead of just 96%, those extra 4% new rigs wouldn't be producing until 2023, and even then, they would still just be ~4% more.  And that's assuming that 4% would wind up actually being drilled and not just being sat on until the permit expires.  An estimated 4% in future production would barely move the needle on the price tag.\n\nAs for not drilling on Native land being a huge hit, Native land makes up less that 2.3% of the Nation.\nEdit:  And if Native land was as rich in oil as you think it is, there is nothing stopping Native American leadership from approving drilling, they could be making bank, just like Native casinos.",

Which is why the price increase in gasoline in the US can be attributed to inflation of the dollar, but the price increase in other countries can not be.  Inflation of the dollar causes the local currency to be stronger when it's exchanged for dollars.  So the other currency can buy more dollars directly in relation to the inflation level.  Since gasoline prices are rising all over the world, it isn't issues with US currency that are causing the rise.  Therefore, it can't be blamed on the US President.",

Even though US doesn't use much Russian oil, prices have still gone up because US oil companies are selling it to EU. Why sell in the US when you can get lots more selling to EU?\n\nUS oil producers have said publicly that they do not plan to increase production because they are unsure of how long the Russia war will last.

OUR EXPENSE - CANADIAN PROFITS. why are so many so-called patriots simping so hard for a foreign multinational corporation that wouldn't benefit americans in any way, and only risk destroying american land and lives? it boggles my mind. do ya'll really want china to get their bunker fuel and a canadian billionaire to buy another yacht that badly? wtf?",

Let me clarify: \nThe keystone pipeline is still active.\nThe XL expansion was terminated by Biden on his first day in office, though work on it had already been halted.\n\nIf the XL expansion has been allowed to continue, it would have pumped so much crude oil to the refineries, that this gas price issue would be down in a matter of weeks.\n\nYes the keystone is still pumping oil into the US.\nI\u2019m annoyed that instead of giving XL another go, Biden is turning to Venezuela for oil, the country run by a brutal dictator that has his people eating dog in the streets.\nAlso Biden refuses to take down any red tape and get mor companies interested in drilling for US oil, if the XL pipeline is so bad.\nThe US should be energy independent. Then we should slowly ween off until we are all driving Tesla\u2019s. instead Biden moved to quickly and were stuck with this mess.\nAnd he refuses to fix it.\n\n\nBut I thank you for having this conversation, I no longer have the energy to keep this up.\nSee you in the next election, when republicans are going to run over democrats (I swear if trump runs again I will not be happy.

They\u2019re price takers, not price setters.\n\nGlobal demand for oil is higher now than it was before the pandemic, but supply needs more time to catch back up since global production is still far below where it was precovid.",

If I buy something at $5, which then increases in value to $10, I only make a profit if I sell it for more than $5. I could choose to make no profit by selling it for the same price. Oil companies are in the same boat, they can sell it for less than \u201ccurrent market value\u201d and keep making great profits. They instead increase the sell price which is how they keep hitting new records. And who knows, maybe the higher pricing is helping to reduce demand to help keep supplies manageable. I still agree with your initial comment overall, but would specify that blame belongs to many, not just a single person or group. Oil companies absolutely hold part of that blame.",

Yes.\n\nIs it wrong to say he is 100% responsible for a surge in gas prices as of recent? Yes.\n\nIs it wrong to say that due to him cutting off Russian imports of gas it caused a pretty big increase of gas prices? No.\n\nSo the statement \"Biden is responsible for gas prices\" isn't entirely correct, it's not wrong either. It just depends on what the person means by that. If they mean what the statement says at face value, then yes, they are wrong. But if they mean Biden's decision to stop Russian imports of gas caused an increase in prices that otherwise wouldn't have happened, then they'd be right.",
