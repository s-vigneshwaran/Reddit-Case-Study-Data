      "text": "**A reminder from the moderation team:**\n\nTrolling and bigotry are against the rules. Bodily autonomy is a fundamental human right. There is **no non-bigoted way** of advocating that this right be denied to half of the human race just because they happen to have been born with a uterus, no matter how \"polite\" you think you're being.\n\nIf you think you have some \"new\" or \"unique\" argument to the contrary, we assure you in advance that your argument is neither new nor unique. Please see Judith Jarvis Thomson's essay \"[A Defence of Abortion](https://spot.colorado.edu/~heathwoo/Phil160,Fall02/thomson.htm)\" (1971), in which your argument has already been addressed and thoroughly refuted.\n\nIf you feel an uncontrollable urge to argue that women **should not** have rights, there are plenty of places on the internet where this behaviour is considered acceptable. This subreddit is not one of them, and never will be, no matter what half a dozen fascists in DC might say. Trying that here will result in an immediate, permanent ban. **Please consider this your only warning**.\n\n**EDIT**: For those of you who think that \"But isn't *your* intolerance of my desire to force women into chattel slavery ALSO a form of bigotry?\" is a convincing \"GOTCHA!\" argument, [please read the FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/wiki/iamaterribleperson). Those arguments aren't new or interesting, either.\n\nThen turn off your computer, and make an appointment with a qualified psychiatrist.",

          "text": "I taught Judith Jarvis Thomson's essay once in an ethics course (I was the TA, not the professor). My students were assigned to write an essay assessing the central argument. One student turned in an essay that consisted of 3 pages of slut-shaming about how if women could just stay chaste, we wouldn't need abortion, followed by two pages of other talking points taken straight from Fox news shouters and irrelevant assertions about fetal personhood. Needless to say, none of that even begins to address the actual argument.\n\nHe was shocked, *shocked*, when the professor backed me up on the F I gave him. I think he imagined he could turn it into a case of \"viewpoint discrimination\". He assumed that if he could control the politics of the situation, he didn't actually need a stronger argument \u2014 a principle we have seen play out on a catastrophic scale today, sadly.\n\n(By the way, I do think there have been some interesting advances in the literature on the ethics of abortion in the last 50 years. Of course, all of them are in defense of a woman's autonomy.)",

Blame those that use religion for their own vile agenda. \n\nI've taken my fair share of theological studies during university because I went to a Catholic university. I had the same 2 professors for my handful of theology courses and let me tell you... They are not anything reddit think religious people are. They are understanding people that understand that there's room within the scriptures for people to make their own decisions. They understand that the bible isn't this overarching command of law. The general principles of being good to your fellow human and to not covet wealth when that wealth can be used to better the community are what they stood by because of their religious nature. They understood that science is real and that having a belief in something should not take precedent over what is sincere and genuine in the natural world. That's what religion is and that's how it was taught to me when I was in my earlier 20s. As a systems focused bio grad, I genuinely enjoyed my theology courses as much as if not more than some of my bio courses. Not bc the material was some invigorating revolution but bc those religious professors were such good people with amazing ideas on what it meant to be a human being on this earth. \n\nSo all in all, for the professors who I respect to heaven hell and back, please don't condemn the religion. Condemn the villains using a corrupting the ideas of religion and pushing their horrid agendas.",

After about 20 - 30 years more of Christian fundamentalism, we will likely see more child marriage, certainly a full ban on any rights for LGBT individuals, and a bunch of other  things i can't even fathom.  Could they possibly make condoms illegal? maybe.  They will continue to grow a massive U.S. deficit, such that it will make the government unable to regulate corporations at all anymore.

Doubling down on stupid claims that can't be proven is what they're entire community is built around. They think a guy died for 3 days 2000 years ago then zoomed off into space after getting out- they're not BIG on doing their due diligence and checking multiple sources. \n\nNo, being willfully ignorant and denying evidence is something they TAKE PRIDE IN. Of course there might be exceptions to this rule, (I have a major bone to pick with anyone calling themselves Christian \"but it's just a metaphor\"- PLEASE STOP CALLING YOURSELF THAT THEN. You're simply a fan of mythology like I am at that point, and you might as well include other good stories with morals from other religions while you're at it.) but OVERALL- Christian's are told ridiculous fairy tales, then told to believe them all of their adult lives. It's backed up by their shitty community, and it's backed by telling someone they're constantly being monitored by a supernatural big brother. It is a giant game of emperor's new clothes- and those people do not care about learning, they care about not offending the emperor or the people around them pretending as well.",

The point is, it's completely ridiculous to compare the chances of making a difference to the lottery.\n\nYou won't win them over by telling them facts though. In fact, don't even bring up voting in the first place.\n\nInstead, ask if they would take some incremental action now towards a positive result in the future. You can use any better example you come up with or feel is right, but saving for retirement comes to mind. A young person saving might not see the results for decades, or they may have an emergency that kills them or wipes it out, but ask if they agree it's still good sense to plan and save.\n\nThen bring up the topic of voting but not the statistics yet.\n\nNow, ask them if they could see ahead of time what the swing margins of a particular election would be, would they go vote if that margin was 1 (their individual vote)? Would they go vote if that margin were 10? 100? 500? 1,000? 10,000? You get the picture.\n\nThen finally break out the stats. Show them \"In this district/city/state of ## population, there were ## people that voted, and only ## people were the deciding factor.\"\n\nHearing it broken down can have an impact that just being told to vote doesn't. But because people can be obstinate, hence all the foreplay and dancing around.",

Its foolish thinking that there was some favoritism going on as it is foolish to think the nation was not founded on Christian beliefs just to serve the current shift in beliefs in our day. Its that opinion that seeks to rewrite history when it states otherwise.\n\nThe misconception most have is the freedom of religion protects only those of organized faith which is untrue. It also protects those who are atheists or undefined in their beliefs.\n\nThe freedom to choose what we wish to believe is there for all.  You can be prodestant, catholic, mormon, baptist, Lutheran, atheist, or undefined. So remember that the law protects everyone as a citizen regardless of belief.",

The only prevailing idea was that some type of god may have created everything.  But most of the founding fathers were deists because they did not think that the creator god was detached from creation.  They rejected the Genesis story of creation.  They thought of Jesus as a great teacher who enunciated some noble principles, but they rejected that Jesus was divine or produced miracles.  The \"Jefferson Bible\" was something created by Thomas Jefferson.  He basically took the gospel stories and took out all the miraculous stories he did not believe.  He left the teachings of Jesus that are worthwhile.",

I started going to church less frequently after I graduated college, but still believed it all. As I met more secular people in the real world, I changed in my mind my picture of God, but I still believed in him.\n\nIt wasn't until I went to law school (at 33 years old) that I ever stopped to think about whether God was actually real. Turns out, when I applied the rules of evidence, I found that I didn't have any competent evidence for anything I had believed in. It was a truly transformative experience.\n\nBut yeah, I guess most of the SC justices haven't done that analysis.",

This hierarchy involves a morality centered around social status such that the aristocrat is inherently moral (an extension of the divinely ordained king) and the lower working class is inherently immoral. The actions of a good person are good. The actions of a bad person are bad. The only bad action a good person can take is to interfere with the hierarchy. All conservative groups in all times and places are working to undo the French Revolution, democracy, and working class rights.\n\nPopulist conservative voter groups are created and controlled with propaganda. They wish to subjugate their local peers and don\u2019t see the feet of aristocrats kicking them too.\n\nAnother way, Conservatives - those who wish to maintain a class system - assign moral value to people and not actions. Those not in the aristocracy are immoral and therefore deserve punishment.\n\nYour low key Christian who goes to church and otherwise lives a normal life and either votes against Conservatives or doesn't vote at all, is a fool who's lunatic childhood belief is being taken advantage of. The other set of working class Christians is just trying to implement hierarchy around them locally. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4CI2vk3ugk\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Luu1Beb8ng\n\nhttps://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/05/religious-right-real-origins-107133/\n\nhttps://pages.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/agre/conservatism.html\n\nConservatism isn\u2019t an American phenomena.

There are 20 people on each planet, and 1 billion (by that time) in the US. That means that 140 people would have more power to elect a US president than 1 billion.\n\nNow, rewind. Do you see how stupid that sounds in the current context? That a small number of people should hold equal or greater power solely based on the fact that the land they occupy gets an equal amount of votes? It's absolutely ridiculous.",

To me it seems like they\u2019re purposefully making issues for us to argue with each other over so that we won\u2019t overthrow the clearly corrupt government, (as per our constitutional right) if there was a way to peacefully vote every corrupt politician out of office then America would be solid, but evidence over the past hundred years has shown that politicians only slow everything to a stand still so they can live off of the tax payer money forever and have the best life possible while not making real genuine changes for anyone else. JFK and Nixon were debating about health care and school and abortions just like we do today, politicians just keep the arguments going so the changes aren\u2019t made.",

In my opinion, out of all the people ive argued with over the right to body autonomy and abortion, women are the ones who truly believe without fault that it is evil. More men have that standpoint because they know it gives them certain advantages and are willing to bend their beliefs if its convenient for them. But in order to convince someone that they shouldnt have rights over their own body, its much more of a brainwashed core value for them. And in order for men to actually have this vantage point, there have to be a surplus of women that they readily have power over, and they do. Like some religions believe that the use of contraceptives is evil, which can include pulling out. And contraceptives like the pill arent only used for prevention of pregnancy. So who does that ultimately benefit?",

Read the news. Hell, if you're lazy, watch TikTok. The world is a Religious, Racist, Sexist place where people use their made up religions to hold people down.   \n\n\n1.) The police in the US are corrupt as fuck, but then again they are in just about every country in the world. Why? Because being \"above the law\" attracts corrupt people into the profession.   \n\n\n2.) Putin invaded ukraine because he's dieing of cancer and before he's gone he wants to \"put the USSR back together\"   \n\n\n3.) Trans rights are being stepped on all over the world, in the US specifically they are making laws so that parents to help their children transition can be put in jail. They are making it illegal to play sports with your identified gender. (Meanwhile sports are totally made up bullshit analogs for war that a bunch of southerns still think matter)  \n\n\n4.)  Abortion rights are being stripped away at the federal level which now means the trigger laws in states like Alabama, Georgia, Iowa, Ohio and South Carolina go into effect banning abortions right away. (but people need abortions and shouldn't be forced to raise a child from rape, or that they can't afford/don't want, or that will kill the mother if they have them)  \n\n\n5.) Now that roe v wade has been overturned it opens up the court to cite that overturning as evidence to overturn the gay marriage laws, interracial marriage laws, contraception laws and more.   \n\n\nDo you want me to keep going, telling you the news that's literally been on the top of every news site for 2022? Or would you also like to know about the 220+ mass shootings in the US? The January 6 investigation where Trumps own daughter says he was trying to overturn the election? What else do you now know that is considered common knowledge.",

It just says to preach the gospel. Matthew and Mark are virtually the same story just being told from two different perspectives, with the default Hebrew speaking it in more of a way to go out and spread the news, not to sit someone down and force them. It's different.   \n\n\nFor fun I'll point you here:  \n1 Thessalonians 4:11-12:  \nAnd to aspire to live quietly, and to mind your own affairs, and to work with your hands, as we instructed you, so that you may walk properly before outsiders and be dependent on no one.  \n\n\nChristians should be proud to confess their faith, but not to force it onto others. Mind our business, love others, if you ask about it and wanna talk, lets talk! Otherwise I don't think we have any business telling others what to do.

It's nice that there is finally a government that decided to do something, but this should've never been an issue in the first place. Neglecting something over decades (as both big parties have done) and then doing something when an actual war is happening right on NATOs borders is nothing to cheer about.\n* The renewable energies (and the necessary expansion of our infrastructure) was neglected for years. Action took place once our supreme court issued a ruling that made continuing the prior policies straight up illegal. It's not like our politicians did something on their own accord. \n* Cannabis is not legalized right now.

Not that hard to do; other countries managed to do it.\n\nBtw. the people in power in the US are not the same as they were decades before. That is nothign new, it is how a democracy works.

              "text": "While this is Florida specific, it represents a broad amount of Republican political movements since 2015 or so.\n\nFor decades, the Democratic Party had commanded a majority of Florida\u2019s registered voters. But the state was changing, as Trump\u2019s election helped energize a shift in political affinities. The Republican Party\u2019s rank and file became increasingly radical, and G.O.P. leaders appeared only too happy to follow them. \u201cThere was always an element of the Republican Party that was batshit crazy,\u201d Mac Stipanovich, the chief of staff to Governor Bob Martinez, a moderate Republican, told me. \u201cThey had lots of different names\u2014they were John Birchers, they were \u2018movement conservatives,\u2019 they were the religious right. And we did what every other Republican candidate did: we exploited them. We got them to the polls. We talked about abortion. We promised\u2014and we did nothing. They could grumble, but their choices were limited.\n\n\u201cSo what happened?\u201d Stipanovich continued. \u201cTrump opened Pandora\u2019s box and let them out. And all the nasty stuff that was in the underbelly of American politics got a voice. What was thirty-five per cent of the Republican Party is now eighty-five per cent. And it\u2019s too late to turn back.\u201d\n\n[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/06/27/can-ron-desantis-displace-donald-trump-as-the-gops-combatant-in-chief](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/06/27/can-ron-desantis-displace-donald-trump-as-the-gops-combatant-in-chief)\n\nIn the 1970s, abortion became a political issue:\n\nBut four decades ago, when Biden was a young senator from Delaware, it was far less unusual for a Democrat to support restrictions on abortion, just as it was not unusual to see Republicans voting for abortion rights.\n\nThe story of the abortion debate since the 1970s is one of party leaders moving farther and farther apart on the issue. The reasons, scholars and activists say, are a combination of grassroots activism and establishment political strategy. The results are a landscape that would be unrecognizable to many voters in 1982 \u2014 or even five years ago.\n\nIn the 1970s, politicians\u2019 views on abortion didn\u2019t break down along neat party lines. While Republican President Gerald Ford opposed Roe v. Wade, first lady Betty Ford was an abortion-rights supporter and Ford\u2019s vice president Nelson Rockefeller presided over the repeal of abortion restrictions in New York, as Linda Greenhouse and Reva B. Siegel explained in their book Before Roe v. Wade. In Congress, Republicans voted against abortion at about the same rate as Democrats.\n\n[https://www.vox.com/2019/4/10/18295513/abortion-2020-roe-joe-biden-democrats-republicans](https://www.vox.com/2019/4/10/18295513/abortion-2020-roe-joe-biden-democrats-republicans)\n\nThe Federalist Society has been working to bend the justice system more conservative since 1982.\n\nSpring of 1982. America was mired in a recession\u2014still-new President Ronald Reagan was being forced to defend to a skeptical public his economic policies\u2014while members of Congress fretted about the chances of a nuclear war with the Soviet Union. Despite this uncertainty, a few conservative students at elite law schools sensed not anxiety but a moment of opportunity. Inspired by Reagan\u2019s ideology and emboldened by his election, they did something ambitious to the point of audacious. They asked a collection of the country\u2019s most notable right-leaning scholars, judges and Department of Justice officials to assemble at one of the very hubs of liberal orthodoxy, the campus of Yale University. Convened principally by Steven Calabresi, who was at Yale Law, and Lee Liberman and David McIntosh, who were at University of Chicago Law, some 200 people arrived in New Haven, Connecticut, on the last weekend of April for a three-day symposium.\n\nIt had a dry title\u2014\u201cA Symposium on Federalism: Legal and Political Ramifications\u201d\u2014and it easily could have been just another set of lectures, of interest only to a small lot of participants and attendees, the kind of higher-ed, corkboard-flyer get-togethers that happen all the time with no broader fanfare or larger lasting consequences. But at this one, as speakers castigated what they viewed as coastal elites and a leftist media and legal establishment and argued for a more \u201coriginalist\u201d reading of the Constitution, people present felt a new sort of buzz. In the hallways, between the sessions, the vibe was more than just brainy. It was practically giddy.\n\n[https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/08/27/federalist-society-yale-history-conservative-law-court-219608/](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/08/27/federalist-society-yale-history-conservative-law-court-219608/)\n\nThis is roughly, a 50 year plan in the making from Republicans. It escalated in 2015 when Mitch the bitch decided to simply not hold a vote on Merrick Garland.\n\nIn hindsight, Obama should've pushed forcing Merrick on the court by concluding that the Senate's inaction would allow him to take action.\n\nCome January, President Barack Obama will be consigned to the sidelines as Donald Trump occupies the Oval Office and begins the work of dismantling his legacy. But there is one action that Obama could take on January 3, 2017 that could hold off some of the worst potential abuses of a Trump administration for up to a year. Obama can appoint his nominee Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court on that date, in between the two sessions of Congress.\n\nBased on everything we know about Obama\u2019s temperament and politics, he won\u2019t resort to this. But given how Republicans relentlessly obstructed his efforts for eight years, he would be completely justified in playing one final trump card. And there\u2019s a cost to ignoring that card. The fact that Democrats prefer to maintain governance norms, even while Republicans break them time and again, inescapably pushes the policymaking apparatus of the country to the right.\n\n[https://newrepublic.com/article/138787/obama-can-put-merrick-garland-supreme-court](https://newrepublic.com/article/138787/obama-can-put-merrick-garland-supreme-court)",

See, I have this thing called a brain which allows me to compartmentalize different thoughts and decide which ones are relevant based on the logical analysis of a given situation.   The only reason you don't like it is because you've built part of your social wealth based on an identity of being an empathic and \"nice\" individual, and a hateful person succeeding would devalue your worth.  You don't see it that way, of course, because yourself and society have spent a lifetime convincing you that this is noble and stems from some quasi-mystical property of the universe itself.   At best, it stems from an altruistic group survival trait in humans as a product of evolution, which is just as cold and soulless as any other mathematical system.

Everyone on this sub should check out this thread. \nTrueAtheism/comments/ucf3bh/will_religion_ever_disappear/\n\nIn my case some anger stems from my expectations of other people, however neuroanatomist Jill Bolte Taylor observed, \"Most of us think of ourselves as thinking creatures that feel, but we are actually feeling creatures that think.\"\n\nSome say that violence doesn't solve violence but I saw an interesting way of framing it. It's true long-term but not short-term. Long-term the answers to war, crime, and confrontation will be diplomacy, prosperity, and education. Short-term if you've exhausted attempts at discussion there's nothing wrong with defending yourself. \n\nEmotions are tense but we must take a step back and consider what the best decisions are moving forward. \n\nI also think that if it is good to be good then those that do wrong invariably harm themselves. I need not punish them further. If we are to be rid of religion in any meaningful capacity it will be through respectful discussion, kindness, and as the thread above says education and the elimination of poverty. \n\nThat said we need to draw a line in the sand. We were already supposed to have a wall 200+ years ago. \n\nI admit I don't know what actions I should or should not take going forward, but I do know that inaction is now no longer viable.",

It\u2019s vitally important to convince young people not to sit this November out. What\u2019s especially scary is that in 2024, Democrats have a rough Senate map, defending seats in Republican states. If Democrats lose Congress in November and further lose seats in 2024, Republicans could obtain a filibuster and veto proof majority. They could succeed in passing total abortion ban. Hell they could even criminalize gay marriage at that point.",

A few years ago I wouldn't have thought it possible. Maybe I think too much of people. If this happens in my country I will never have sex again unless I can get a hysterectomy. I mean that. BC is not reliable enough. Even if I did get a hysterectomy, I'm not sure I'd ever want to have sex again. I don't think I'd ever feel like showing a man any kind of affection ever again. This shit disgusts and angers me so much. \n\nPeople will die because of this. Young girls will lose the opportunity to follow their dreams. Children will be born into poverty, and into abusive situations. They will be born to parents who cannot cope, who do not want them. They will be born with birth defects that make their quality of life effectively zero. This decision will increase suffering to an unthinkable degree.\n\nTo call their movement pro-life is a sick joke. It's pro-birth at best. They don't give a single fuck about these children after they're born. These are the same people who are against welfare. Why can't the baby pull itself up by its bootstraps?

Granted, removing it once implanted would be complicated but should be possible. If the 'life' of the embryo is preserved, it would not be abortion. This would also be important for ectopic pregnancies, which right now would doom a woman to almost certain death even though removing the fetus would save her life. \n\nPreserve the embryo, and let devoted xtian women volunteer to house it for 9 months of preganancy and childbirth",

      "text": "Or, screw Christians who never read the bible. The book I read had a god kill every 1st born son. The God I read about ordered soldiers to go into a city, seek out pregnant women, and stab them in the belly. And he did that more than once. The God I read about killed every pregnant woman and every baby in a global flood. The same God summoned 2 bears to go maul 42 children to death because a couple of them called a prophet a baldy. But he is somehow pro-life to Christians and conservatives. They have no clue what's in their holy book. Apparently their church never has them open the bible to them pages on Sunday.",

This is the first challenge to Roe v Wade *that the Supreme Court has chosen to hear*, not the first attempt at a challenge to Roe v Wade since Kavanaugh joined the court.\n\nA lot of things came together to give republicans the control over the courts they needed to overturn roe v Wade.  If people hadn\u2019t elected Trump in 2016, yes, this wouldn\u2019t be happening.  Or if RBG had stepped down when Obama could have replaced her, this also likely wouldn\u2019t be happening.

What it did do was give doctors the right to their privacy in regards to practicing abortions. It did this by using the substantive due process clause of the 14th amendment, which is a legal loophole that allows the Supreme Court to, in practice, legislate. It also utilized a penumbra that draws from other articles of the amendment pertaining to privacy, such as the 4th amendment\u2019s right to not allow soldiers to sleep in your house, but I digress\n\nMy point is that RBG also didn\u2019t like the Roe ruling for legal reasons",

Theorhetically a president was going to have better insight then the average citizen who had no idea about anything other than their farm issues and possibly town issues. The speed of information was so ridiculously slow that there were people that shouldnt vote because they didnt know federal issues and did not have access to information regarding the politicians or issues of the day. With the internet we should be able to hold country wide referendums on an app that could be voted on next day.  The system is corrupt the system is out dated the system is broken.",

But if there is any further injury, then you shall appoint as a penalty life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot\u2026\u201d\n\nJust to be clear, the injured party being referred to here is the woman. I hope this is obvious. If the fetus dies = fine. If the woman dies = death penalty. The value of these two are clearly not weighed the same. \n\nNumbers 5:27-28\n\n\u201cIf she has made herself impure and been unfaithful to her husband, this will be the result: When she is made to drink the water that brings a curse and causes bitter suffering, it will enter her, her abdomen will swell and her womb will miscarry, and she will become a curse.\nIf, however, the woman has not made herself impure, but is clean, she will be cleared of guilt and will be able to have children.\u201d\n\nWhile we can definitely fixate on how terrible this is to prescribe a woman accused with being unfaithful with what sound like an unsafe abortion drug that sometimes doesn\u2019t work, let\u2019s focus on the fact that there is a passage in the Bible where abortion is prescribed. \n\nThe main argument for abortion seems to be all of the verses about God knowing them before they were born. But if God were all knowing he would know which fetuses are going to be aborted and which fetuses would miscarry. Do Christians really believe that God had a plan for miscarried children? Or that someone could foil his divine plan with an abortion? Absolutely ridiculous.\n\nI just want to spread the word because female autonomy is extremely important and Christians in particular need to change their mind on this. I think the easiest way to change their minds is with the book they worship.",

If you're looking for God's guidelines for how to treat your slaves, or when it's appropriate to stone somebody to death in the street versus burning them at the stake, it's the place to go! \n\nNonetheless, Christians still get it wrong. Judaism does not forbid abortion, in fact, it requires it in cases where the mother's health is at risk. The New Testament never mentions abortion. So, I refer you to Matthew 5:17  where Jesus says :\u201cDo not think that I have come to abolish Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.\u201d All the arguments about when life begins are irrelevant, like speculating on how angels can dance on a pinhead.",

It was treated like I was starting a cult just to be willing to have open conversation about issues like abortion or evolution or anything non-fundementalist. Anyway I'm trying but honestly fixing the church from the inside is nigh impossible. It's just so bad.",

      "text": "A lot of men feel as if their reward for participating in a capitalist society is a women to dote on them, to birth their progeny or even to make them feel not alone.  They are told throughout their lives by media, educators and parents that if they just work hard and \"be nice\" they will get the prize, and the prize is a women.  They believe that by giving women the ability to participate in academia and to participate in the work force and the levers of power that you are reducing a women's dependency on men.  That unless women are actually forced into poverty and potential homelessness that they will have no need for men and thus will not be available to be there as a prize for the system that uses these men as fuel.  These are men that have done \"everything right\" and now feel entitled to that \"prize.\"  Instead of getting angry at a system that uses them up while feeding them lies of \"eventual happiness\" a lie that it doesn't have the ability to deliver they get angry at women.  They begin to believe that women can be forced or cudgeled by society into actually choosing to live a life with them.  Once again these ideas are stories that we have been telling men and boys their whole lives.  From leave it to beaver to Marvel's End Game (Steve gets to spend a life with his lady friend as the prize for returning the infinity stones).  I believe that is why conservatives and the far right want to erode the rights of women, so they don't have to see them as individuals with there own hopes, dreams, and autonomy because none of that gets them the \"prize\".  They want to see them as an object that can be forced into submission, because they believe that to be a women's natural state.  Obviously this rolls into ideas of white supremacy pretty easily as well as anti LGBTQ+ stuff.  They are in love with the idea of the \"nuclear family\" as a prize for capitalism which is why the perceived threat to it by homosexuals and feminists must be fought at every chance.  They see the flourishing of these ideas as the end of \"good capitalism\" instead of capitalism's need for infinite growth in the face of limited recourses, or the funneling of all resources to a very few or even the exploitation of their minds and bodies to feed the growth as the problem. It is much easier to blame women for your unhappiness than the system that has left you unhappy.  A system I will remind you that is still ran almost entirely by wealthy white men.  But wealthy white men can't be your enemy, because that is what you aspire to be.  So must be women.  This is not a Christianity problem, this is a capitalism problem.  Ok, it may be both.",

And unfortunately, the Democrats didn\u2019t have the power to stop the three Trump appointments. \n\nIn 2016, when Bernie Sanders could have been the DNC nominee, the DNC capitulated to HRC\u2019s tantrum and arranged for her to be the nominee via super delegates. I mean, no way Trump beats HRC, right? Wrong. And then, he appts 3 conservative justices. Unprecedented.\n\nOur two-party system is in full-on power grab mode right now, and has been for some time. Right now, if the RNC continues to back Trump heading into 2024, this is a pure power grab. Trump is toxic to our country, an egomaniac and will be bad again (worse?) for the US. Will the RNC grow a pair and denounce Trump in favor of a better leader and candidate? Hard to say. They should, but they may not. And he will take credit for this, and rally the pro-life activists around him. And the RNC will ride that wave back into GLORIOUS power. Shame. Shame on all our politicians for putting party ahead of country. I disgusted and fed up will all of them.\n\nSo, if they back Trump, and he is re-elected, that election, too, will have consequences. God only knows what they will be, but there will be consequences. And I don\u2019t believe they will be good ones.",

It turned out a lot of catholics weren't voting, and catholics were pretty anti-abortion (and contraception). \n\n\nThey used to be the only Christian sect with a hardline anti-abortion stance, but the Nixon campaign was able to spin this narrative that abortion was a symptom of lawlessness, liberal permissiveness on social issues, and a sign of social ruin. At the time a lot of people were still pretty mad at liberals for racial integration, so there was a lot of pre-existing rage and momentum for the Nixon campaign to draw from. \n\n\nSo religious folks were manipulated by a political campaign. Yes, religion is a major reason this is happening. I personally don't hate religion, but it's foolish to deny reality here.",

Everything from controlled internet, to what type of media they can consume, to cameras everywhere with AI monitoring. It is a dystopia of it's own. \n\nAnd sure there are secular countries which are terrible places and religious countries which are terrible. But if were were to draw up a comparison of every secular government vs religious government and draw a comparison of how well the average person, richest person and poorest person is doing in that country. I think it would be easy to draw a conclusion towards secular being far superior.",

While this is a determinative weighing factor, the issue itself is an areligious moral issue.\n\nThe question thus ultimately becomes what is more valuable morally, the bodily autonomy of a woman or the life/eventual life of the Fetus. This is something that can be very hard to wrestle with irregardless of one's religious affiliations or lack thereof.\n\nI find it hard to blame judges and law makers when it relates to this issue because laws are definitionally and at their source, an attempt to codify morality.\n\nFurther, remember what is at stake for individuals that come down on the side of \"life\" vs. autonomy, for them the issue is ultimately the condoning of the ending of a \"life\". This has grave moral implications, as can be attested to by anyone that has had the unfortunate experience of actually having ended a life.\n\nWhile personally I am of the mind that this is a moral issue best left to the woman to weigh and determine, I find it very disingenuous to come down so harshly on people whose moral compass lands them at a different conclusion.",

      "text": "Christianity at its core has one commandment of 'Love one another'. This gets forgotten. There is a complete separation in US politics of faith and religion. Personal, quiet faith helps guide moral actions pretty much regardless of the religion. I don't think any of the people involved in early Christianity would recognise what it has become. Not least the fact that anyone professing to follow its beliefs isn't giving away the shirt off their back to those in need, feeding the poor, healing the sick, protecting the vulnerable, housing the homeless, and loving one another because *that* is what is asked of them.\n\nAnyone financially profiting from religion is probably commiting blasphemy.",

We post more stories about Christianity because Reddit is most popular in countries dominated by Christians.  Many people who post in this sub are hurt personally by Christianity every day.  Our news feeds are filled with stories about Christians doing stupid and hypocritical stuff.  \n\nWe cut none of the theistic religions any slack.  All religions are nonsense.  All religions eventually turn to fundamentalism and try to impose their beliefs on everyone.  We cut no slack for Islam or Hinduism or any other religion.\n\nWe do get a lot of posts about Islam and Hinduism.  We are brutal on them as well.  But you probably don't see them on your news feed.  The Reddit algorithms likely only feed you the stories related to Christianity unless you are a regular reader of /r/atheism and sort by \"/new.\"",
