  "text": "TIFU by cleaning my son\u2019s(13m) bedroom and finding my girlfriend\u2019s(31f) dirty underwear\nLet me start by saying she is not his mother! As any parent does, I tell my son to give me all his dirty laundry (mostly so I don\u2019t have to touch it) so I can wash them for him. \n\nOne day he was not home, so, I went into his room and grabbed his dirty laundry. I notice a balled up towel in the corner of his closet and I just grabbed the end of it, thinking it was just a towel, nope! Out falls 2 of my girlfriends recently worn/dirty underwear! I stand there coming up with crazy scenarios in my head for a second like \u201cmust have gotten caught in the towel when he was done showering\u201d or \u201cmaybe it got messed up in the clean laundry\u201d. Then the realization hits me that our laundry basket is in the bathroom where we shower. \n\nAll I could say to my girlfriend was \u201cwe are about to have a weird conversation and I\u2019m sorry\u201d. I pull out the underwear and say \u201cI found these in (insert son\u2019s name) room\u201d and her jaw just drops. \nI didn\u2019t know what else to say besides \u201cat least we know he likes you\u201d\n\nNow it is a little weird and quiet around my house. The worst part is, I don\u2019t know how to bring it up to him!\n\nTL;DR: found my girlfriend\u2019s underwear in my teenage son\u2019s bedroom when I was just looking for laundry. Now there is a weird silence when my girlfriend encounters my son.\n\nUPDATE 1: The decision has been made to sit him down tonight after dinner. Im going to be short and sweet about it. Tell him that I\u2019ll love him no matter what. Tell him why it wasn\u2019t ok to violate my GFs privacy! Then take the opportunity to see if he wants to talk about anything, but not force him to. \n\nOFF TOPIC: To the guy who messaged me asking to trade my girlfriends dirty underwear for his SISTERS! You\u2019re disgusting!\n\nUPDATE 2: Ok, so here is the update everyone is waiting for! First of all, my decision was not based off any \u201cbro code\u201d. I feel it is my job to mold the best young man. Also, to those suggesting that I should not have told my girlfriend, her privacy was invaded and it\u2019s only right she knows. If he didn\u2019t want to be embarrassed about it, he shouldn\u2019t have done it. I decided to talk to him about it when it was time to drag the trash barrels out to the street. After we each dragged a barrel and we\u2019re walking back I said \u201clisten buddy, I\u2019ll love you no matter what, BUT I found what was in your bedroom in the towel. You\u2019re lucky it was me who found it and not her! That\u2019s extremely inappropriate and not ok, do not ever invade a woman\u2019s privacy like that. Especially, not a girl who has never consented to you in a sexual way. Do we understand each other?!\u201d\n\nHe just dropped his head and said \u201csorry dad\u201d and I just completely dropped it and said \u201cdon\u2019t forget the last barrel and went inside.\n\nUPDATE 3: here are some of the messages I\u2019ve gotten! \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in a similar position\u201d  \nEither by sons or moms that have gone through this, THANK YOU to these people! Perspective truly helps in situations like these! \n\n\u201cDoes your GF have onlyfans\u201d \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude1f\nShe better not!!! \n\n\u201cWhat he is doing is normal. Please leave him alone\u201d \nNo, I appreciate your opinions though! \ud83e\udd25\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a terrible father for not talking to him right away\u201d or \u201cyou\u2019re a terrible father for talking to your GF about it\u201d \nI think figuring out the best move is better then reacting with angry emotions right away!",

That isn't a right you or anyone else has.  As a matter of fact, I have a right to think about anything I want to about you.  I can think about raping you, murdering you, robbing you, literally whatever I want.  There is not a single court that will ever even charge me for having those thoughts in my mind.\n\nMy point is that I feel like it's stupid to be angry about being sexualized. Especially when we're talking about a 13 year old boy.  \n\nThat doesn't mean I think taking the panties is right/okay.  It's not.  But I would address the panties without trying to tell the kid what's okay to think/not think.  As a matter of fact, if it were me, I wouldn't try any of this on my own.  I would just put the kid in therapy and try to do what the therapist was best to do.\n\nBut if I were dating someone who wanted to make it all about them, I'd likely dump them and just focus on fixing my son.\n\n> They weren't trying to gatekeep people's thoughts\n\nIf the thought of someone thinking a thought about you that they don't like, then they're gatekeeping peoples thoughts.  If they weren't gatekeeping, then they wouldn't have stated that it was unacceptable for the child to think about them in that way.  Which is stupid.\n\n>  you assumed they were.\n\nBased on the words they used.",

That somehow that makes people advocating for children less than people, because who would put the feelings of a child over a violated woman?  It's trash opinion.  Our criminal justice system does it every single day.  Children are simply treated differently than adults.\n\nBesides, let's keep it all in context.

You're the only person who had a semi-reasonable take so I wanted to respond.\n\nWhat no one else mentioned (that I saw) is that this is unlikely the only way the child is acting up/out in life.  Or what's going on with biomom (dead, bad divorce, etc.).  Or that this type of behavior could be a sign of past/current sexual abuse.\n\nI did a little bit of searching and I came across this:\n\nhttps://adoption.com/forums/thread/376173/need-advice-stealing-and-women-039-s-underwear/\n\nIt makes me feel sorry for the children.  Again, I don't know that this post is real, but if it is, it may be that this kid has some trauma in his life (due to mom/sisters) and needs some kind of professional help.  I think if I were facing this, I would most definitely involve a therapist.  I wouldn't want to tackle this on my own.   \n\nIt still seems wrong to me for the gf to feel victimized.  She has the right to feel what she wants, but if I were the father, I would be upset with her for making it about her.  I also think it's wrong to address it with punitive measures unless it's part of a comprehensive strategy you've worked out with a therapist.  It seems like you would be creating long-term difficulties for the child if you addressed previous trauma by trying to punish it away.\n\nAnyway, that's my $.03.\n\nEDIT:  Some more reasonable takes:\n\nhttps://www.mamapedia.com/article/what-do-i-do-about-a-12-year-old-who-is-hiding-women-tick-s-underwear-in-his-room",

The issue with 13 year olds is that they're only just starting to explore their sexuality so they frequently don't understand where the boundaries are yet. It's not like they were talked to about this stuff when they were growing up, or what is or isn't acceptable and just to what degree their actions affect others.",

Probably not.  \n\n\nThere's a big difference between knowing instinctively that something is wrong, and having been educated about why something is wrong. There are so, *so* many psychological issues that can arise when sex gets associated with shame in a kid's mind, and potentially destroying their psychological stability rather than giving them some grace as they learn and their brain matures into having better reasoning skills is a really risky call to make.  \n\n\nLetting him know the consequences for this as an adult (\"if you were an adult, you could be charged with a sex crime and face jail time,\" for instance) and explaining that because he's young and needs time for his brain to mature that he won't face those consequences now should be good baseline. Having disciplinary accountability would be perfectly reasonable in this case, but \"punishment\" is likely to just breed resentment, suspicion, secrecy, and potentially further issues down the line. He needs openness, communication, and wisdom in order to learn from this in a way that will create growth, not a harsh hand that causes him to retreat inside himself.",

You sit your son down and explain that it was wrong to steal *anything*, and that what he did steal was a deeply invasive violation of her privacy. I would also have him apologize. \n\nWhat other people are calling shaming I would call humbling. He needs to learn that he cannot take something from a woman because he likes her, and that he is not owed anything from women. Doing anything less is abdicating the responsibility of teaching children the difference between right and wrong. Anything less is endorsing the behavior. \n\nSeparately, the idea that you would not tell your girlfriend about this is horrifying. She is the victim here. I added this to another comment, but what this also does is teach daughters that it's okay if someone steals *her* underwear and she shouldn't say anything because it might embarrass the guy who took it. \n\nAlso, maybe if you wear tighty whiteys you wouldn't notice if one pair went missing but most women have a general idea of the underwear they own, if only because someone underwear works better with certain clothing.",

He's definitely just at the start of all the hormones. Every adult went through it. We get it. But this dad needs to talk to him sooner rather than later.

Awful\n\nThe boyfriend should've talked to his kid first so he can have the kid tell him he won't do it anymore and he can tell the girlfriend what happened, but with a better sense of resolution (not \"hey, my kid is creeping on you... I guess he likes you! Hahhhhh\") by already having  spoken with his son about why it's inappropriate, he can go to his girlfriend telling him about his son. So in this situation he'd already behaving like a parent by discussing a very inappropriate situation with an ignorant child with a sense of resolution before bringing it up to th gf. Because as it stands, it sounds like op didn't do shit and is almos proud of his son..",

How do you deduce that I\u2019d raise my sons to be disrespectful to women? My politics lean strongly liberal and I abhor any sort of violence or aggression towards women (check my post history). \n\nAnd I\u2019m not saying that people can\u2019t have an opinion if they don\u2019t have kids, but dealing with boys going through puberty you see how sex obsessed they can be. That\u2019s natural. I agree that this incident should be nipped in the bud and if it progresses there is an issue. \n\nI am adamant however that he should have spoken with his son first.

We know there will be things we may find that she would not want to know about. \n\nBut perhaps you\u2019re correct that the gf should know about it and may feel violated. I am open minded and have read the responses from women. \n\nI also question where the mother is in this situation and why a girlfriend would be living with he and his son.

Some people just keep doubling down even with so many women telling them. I think a lot of men don't truly realise how humiliating and degrading it can feel to be used for sexual purposes like that. I think it's why many women's responses were so heavy. But if it happens in real life it's probably a bit more nuanced and depends on the relationships between the people like you mentioned with you, your wife and your son. \n\nI don't think it's neccessarily weird the girlfriend is living with them. We don't know how long they've been together. Maybe they've been together a long time and plan to stay together but don't want to get married ever. I don't think we can say anything about that with the facta we have.",

They're uncomfortable seeing this as a sexual violation because the kid is just a kid and probably has zero intent to harm her, but that's exactly why dad needs to step up and teach him that is a huge violation of boundaries. You don't have to *mean* to violate someone in order to do so.\n\nMost of the people arguing against me are pushing back at my reaction as extreme and inappropriate because it's just a joke, and that tells me those people don't know how that kind of violation feels. They're also all flipping it into me for having hard boundaries and not trying to \"communicate\" my way back to a happy point despite the man's clear lack of communication skills being a huge part of the problem. Funny how that double standard works.",

He boiled a really sensitive and delicate situation down to a \"haha this is awkward\" and then rubbed it in a little more with a joke about the teenage boy in the house masturbating to her. Then didn't actually address it further because it's still quiet every time the girlfriend encounters the son, which means they've been around each other multiple times since it happened without any resolution.\n\n Dad is the one responsible for mediating this one, if he's not doing anything about it then that's not just an awkward comment fumble. It's multiple failures to support her or parent his kid, and yeah, I'd feel extremely uncomfortable being around the kid without any kind of resolution to the situation, and I'd feel extremely unsupported by the dad. This isn't a marriage, she's his girlfriend, and I think knowing that you don't feel comfortable further pursing a relationship with someone who reacts that way is perfectly fine. If they were married it would be different, but it would take a lot of work to fix. It's okay to decide a relationship isn't worth that kind of work when you're not committed. \n\nAlso I've been happily married for eight years, so I think I'm set on knowing my boundaries and red flags and still not having a lonely life because of it.",

Denying this responsibility is, to me, childish and/or immature. Again, if you're a girlfriend that's just staying over for a bit, it's different. Moving in though is a commitment \"I want to be part of this family\" and a lot more goes into that than bonking the dad and cooking up some breakfast.\n\nSo a girlfriend living NOT being a coparent, some form of mother figure, is ridiculous to me and a recipe for disaster.\n\nCall me old fashioned...",

The way you do this is via open dialog with the child's other parent. You don't just secede parental responsibility to basically a stranger when your co-parent decides to commit to another relationship.\n\nHowever, it is normal for adults living with a child to be in a role of authority.

I stayed the weekends at my father every two weeks. I loved him to bits (he has since passed away), but he was barely \"in the loop\" to be a parent. Meanwhile my stepfather (even before my mother married him) took care of us (as well as can be expected from a previously single guy suddenly saddled with 3 children. In the long run, he was as much, if not more, a father to me than my biological dad. Nobody \"seceded\" anything. My dad wasn't around much, so there was no way for him to be involved in the day to day parenting the way my stepdad was. But both were/are my father. Then when my dad remarried as well I had two moms. My actual mom who took the lionshare and my stepmom who looked after us, again, as best as she could (I eventually even got a stepsis out of it). My stepmom never asked for 2 stepchildren (my older sister never visited as much as me and my brother did), but she still was a parent to us. Not like a teacher or a caretaker that has authority.\n\nSo I believe I'm qualified enough in my opinion that:  \na) Someone not THERE, physically present, has a diminished role as a parent. They're still a parent 100%. Nobody can take that away from them, but they can only execute that role in a diminished capacity. Sure there are \"tricks\" to mitigate this. Living closeby. Lots of communication. But that doesn't take away that the baseline is lower.  \nb) An adult deciding to live in a household with children becomes a parent of sorts, whether they choose to or not. This can even extend to other adults. An uncle. A grandmother. They all become a parent. NOBODY IS REPLACING ANYBODY here. Not in an official capacity of course. But each additional \"parent\" just helps more in rearing the children of the house. This becomes very apparent in other cultures where entire families live under the same roof or very closeby.\n\nNaturally, you don't HAVE to convince me, so we can leave it at \"agreeing to disagree\", but so far I'm not hearing anything convincing here.",

I'm saying that's not the ideal to strive for.\n\n> And the \"large impact\" is due to the extra effort they had to put in to compensate for the distance.\n\n\nThis is weird point to make. Are you saying parents don't normally have a large impact on their child's life? \n\nAlso no one is saying its easy to co-parent with an ex. Yes you have to make the extra effort to be a part of your child's life if you don't live with them, I'm not arguing that. I'm arguing that its possible and desirable between two people with the best of intentions where it doesn't work out as a couple. \n\nI would agree my partners dad had to put in the extra effort. but he wasn't the only one putting in the extra effort.

Because they are not old enough nor mature enough to provide consent.\n\nBut according to your double-standard, in one case he'd be treated like a child and protected and the other he'd be treated like an adult and punished.\n\nWhich is it?  Is 13 a child or is 13 an adult?\n\n> I could say \"he's 13, what if he was 18?\" WTF is that bringing to the conversation?\n\nTo be honest, your hypothetical question would bring even less to the conversation.  The person you're responding to was trying to remind you of the fact that this is indeed a child.  Your question is just, \"Yeah, but what if he were an adult?\"  He's not.  He's a child.\n\nYou also know nothing of this child's background.  What intellectual level is he operating at?  Has he suffered any abuse?  Especially sexual abuse.  Does he have other personal/family problems in his life?  Does he have learning disabilities?  Health issues, etc., etc., etc.\n\n> He's old enough to learn not to violate women and if he's not taught it's a gateway to assault.\n\nHe is old enough to learn.  But that's not the question.  The question is - is he old enough and mature enough to be held accountable for these actions, and if so, what type of response will help him and the family the most?\n\nThe spirit of lot of these comments aren't about helping anything, but just about being as punitive as possible and fuck whatever happens to this child.\n\nTypical reddit double-standard.\n\nEDIT:  I also want to ask...how do you know that this child isn't/wasn't abused?  I was actually curious and did a little google searching.  Although the specifics aren't exactly the same, there are similarities:\n\nhttps://adoption.com/forums/thread/376173/need-advice-stealing-and-women-039-s-underwear/\n\nMy personal opinion is that it's unlikely the panty stealing is the only issue OP's son is having (assuming the post is even real).  There are likely other things going on that he may/may not know about.  Considering it's the GF, how long was the divorce, how's mom taking it (is he a widow?), etc, etc.  This is likely a more complex issue than simply sexual gratification/exploitation.  So I'll say again, it's wrong to approach this from the victim's point of with punitive action in mind.\n\nAnd because it's a child, I would say that he sounds more like he needs some type of healing rather than some type of punishment.  And of course, to my original point, it's ridiculous for the gf to make it about her.  I think the focus should be on the health of the child.",

Fantasies are just that, fantasies and a parent shouldn't operate as \"thought police\"; yes, it's awkward and inappropriate but you can't punish your kid for being awkward and hormonal.\n\nStealing of property for such a purpose though is wrong. At 13 they might not understand that because \"it's not like I did something to her; I did something to underwear, and the underwear doesn't have feelings\" without understanding that OP's girlfriend did not consent to her underwear being used for such a purpose. That OP's kid knew it would make OP's girlfriend uncomfortable if she found out what he'd used her property for and he did it anyway, and that in and of itself is wrong. Just explain that what he did is something you need consent for.\n\nIts not something any parent or child wants to talk about, and if the kid already feels remorseful and realizes what he did is wrong it should be dropped quickly with a \"don't do it again\" (and then left alone unless he does it again). If he doesn't understand though it needs to be explained so that he does understand (and then left alone unless he does it again). \n\nIts understandable that kids will fuck up with stuff like this, they're still learning how to human properly; but they'll never learn how to human properly if you choose to avoid teaching them because its awkward.",

The kid doesn't get a chance to talk about it or anything like that; they just have to sit there and feel ashamed, and then that feeling gets kind of \"stuck\" in the body and re-activated whenever something reminds you of the situation. \n\nSource: \"The Body Keeps the Score\" by Bessel van der Kolk.

But my take on this is, there absolutely needs to be a conversation, however brief, that discusses the issue. Supporting the person with his nuclear and yet to be understood 13y/o sexual urges, while clearly marking out what is ok, and what is totally off limits bc it is hurtful to others (ie: shit that \"can never happen again\") \n\nAssuming OPs son is within the normal range of emotional and cognitive development, I gotta go with a talk about this, vs a hard slap. The latter approach may work well in the very short term, but with a strong risk for sexual dysfunction and deviance, long term.",

But, before you actually involve that person in your fantasy (in any capacity - even by \u201cjust\u201d physically taking their personal belongings to be used as an aid), you need consent, otherwise it is a form of harassment. Teenage boys ESPECIALLY need to be taught this, and any woman will tell you that the number of grown men out there who very obviously were not is astounding. \n\nNo one is saying that the kid in question should be severely punished or shamed for what he did, but if you are a parent it is your duty to teach your kids about boundaries, and this is an important one.",

If it's reoccurring or his son starts exhibiting other unhealthy behaviors towards his girlfriend, then yes she should absolutely know about it. At the end of the day, he's a parent first and foremost and a good partner will respect that.\n\nI'm editing my reply a little bit because I feel like I should clarify my position a little better. It seems to me the kid just saw the underwear in the basket in an area of the house and made an error in judgement. If he were to do something like purposefully invade her privacy by trying to peep on her in the shower or something like that, I think that's much more serious and that is something she should know about right away.\n\nWith the underwear, it might have had more to do with the object rather than the person.",

Obviously as a general statement most people would say of course that is true. It's totally different if a naive 13 year old who just started experiencing hormonal urges steals underwear versus a fully matured 30 year old adult. I don't see any useful reason to argue your point of view other than wanting to be right about something in a very technical way that ignores situational context. Calling someone a creep is shaming them. If you believe that's the best way to handle a 13 year old who likely is not fully thinking through these actions until he is hit with the reality of being caught then I don't really have anything further to say. People make mistakes (especially children). shaming is rarely the answer, especially with children...",

Nobody wants to publicly announce that they are masturbating, so it is a given that he is going to hide the underwear. I don't think it has anything to do with stealing or crossing boundaries in his mind. Teenagers generally are not explicitly aware of the concept of boundaries, and 'stealing' in this scenario is a bit different from stealing something with inherent value such as money. It seems like you are looking at aspects of the situation extremely literally when things are almost never that simple. Yes, it is 'literally' creepy to steal underwear. It is also a lot different in a situation like this where the 'thief' is a teenager who is just beginning puberty. It does seem like we are on the same page overall with resolutions. I just genuinely do not understand what the point of pushing so hard to call it creepy is. It doesn't add anything of value to the discussion unless you are trying to literally define an action (ignoring the actual context of the action within the story). I just don't see the point in replying with irrelevant points within a discussion like this",

Right now he is living with humiliation- that\u2019s enough to keep him from doing it again. \n\nWhen I was about his age, I took my dads magic wand (that my parents used for back injuries\u2026 please let it have been only for back injuries) and used it for my own teenage girly purposes- then stashed it because there wasn\u2019t an easy way to return it at that time. It was found before I could get a chance to. They could have put it up and their knowledge that I had it in my room would have kept me from ever even looking at the thing again. Or they could have confronted me about touching their personal things which would have led to shame and anxiety surrounding masturbation and anything regarding sex.\n\nHe knows they know and that\u2019s punishment enough- in fact probably better because he can only hate himself for doing such a dirty thing rather than resenting then for going through his room.",

I am all for enthusiastic consent but I simply do not understand what people expect when it comes to fantasies. David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson didn\u2019t have my permission to when I was exploring my sexuality as a child. The kid that sat two seats behind me in history class, my older sisters boyfriend. These are all people I thought about \u201cgetting married\u201d to. Was it wrong to \u201cuse\u201d them in this manner? Is the better option really for a child to go out and find someone that consents? Sexual fantasies are perfectly healthy and normal for someone of that age and telling them otherwise will definitely make them associate shame with sex.\n\nAnd I both agree and disagree on the panties. My fingers serve the same mechanical purpose the massager did. It was simply exploration and trying something new. Was he using them to jack off to Girlfriend explicitly, or were they something soft or lacy that he could use for a new sensation when imagining Wendy Peppercorn or whoever in them. To me, in that scenario- it\u2019s like teen girls sleeping in guys tshirts/boxers and there were tons of kids that borrowed their brothers when that was the big thing. They aren\u2019t imagining big bro- they are thinking \u201cif Fox Mulder was my boyfriend I\u2019d wear his stuff to bed like this and this is what it would feel like.\u201d - in which case a guys oversized shirt and boxers are way different from a nightgown and panties and then it\u2019s really nothing more than a tool. \n\nWhatever the case I think OP needs to work on the relationship between the three of them. The joke he made kind of implies kid may not have been prepared emotionally to share a home with a new woman. Thank you for having a civil and intelligent conversation. Have a wonderful day.",

His behavior was clearly unacceptable, though, and his actions should by no means be ignored. \n\nI just think the approach to addressing this situation is important for the intended message to be effectively received. He likely feels weird and creepy already and shouldn't be further shamed or embarrassed. That part has been independently acknowledged by all parties involved. Any immediate attention provided will raise his defensiveness, inhibiting the rational application of any words that follow instead of encouraging meaningful communication. Initializing an open, non-judgemental conversation is more likely to result in his general understanding of boundaries and un/acceptable behavior, which is the imperative objective. Secondary discussion of particular implications can (and should) be pursued as they inevitably emerge without the current details and heightened emotions becoming fully entangled with the broader life lesson. \n\nThat expanded into a waaaay more universal reply than I meant.

Don't blame him, explain hormones are raging, you were once his age, you understand, do not worry, life will go on, that porn access is likely different but you'll come back to that.\n\nExplain why as there is another person involved this means consent is required. That is a normal thing and to look forward to the day when they have their own partner. Do not worry. Obviously not to do this again but don't worry, accept feelings are complex and move on. \n\nThoughts are fleeting and one thing we don't have much control over so don't worry but you can generally choose our fantasies. To focus on healthy ones I guess?\n\nOther Redditors may have advice on the last section as I suffered religious trauma around sexuality and lots of shame so I don't know if it's better to avoid teaching thought crime to a 13 year old. \n\nI don't know your families religious context. In a different conversation, separated by time and place, you could chat about porn, how it progresses how there is some porn that is better than others etc how to stay safe but that convo should be one of listening from your side I would think.",

I think over blowing it might make things worse and now you have the poor girlfriend all weirded out. I think it would have been best to just remove panties..put in wash and let things alone until or if you find something else happening.

Which is why I'm treating them in preparation for that. Explaining every little thing is what the 7-10 range is for. By 13-17 it should be less about teaching basic morals and making sure they apply the morals among their peers and general responsibilities. They should be starting to critically think for themselves and consider their passions, with occasional nudges when correcting behavior and guidance pertaining to topics that they aren't *quite* ready for yet (sex, gambling, alcohol). \n\nSilent looks should be enough for a first warning. Which helps bolster their own evaluation of what they did wrong rather than me spitting it out to them like I would 3 years ago on why they are wrong. I'm assuming this is a first offense, so that should be enough. Escalation happens when needed, not as a first offense because suddenly I think my kid is on the path to be a serial abuser.",

There's not much nuance there to explain.  Pornhub is a 13 year old topic (likely after a few years where they already found some porn. But hey, sometimes you gotta experience it yourself so you can have a nuanced conversation). More nuance there is needed because it's a topic they aren't ready for, but should learn before it comes up. That's different from \"keep your hands off stuff that isn't yours\".\n\nDoesn't mean you can't explain it at 13, but I will have considered myself a failure if they legitimately do not understand the issue by that time (aka, escalation is needed).",

It's not like this is a totally innocent, harmless thing that leads to more deviant behaviour, this is already (minorly) unacceptable, and it's not healthy.

In another comment I made I said he probably got the idea from school or one of these ass holes on here that answer every question with a joke and don't even consider they are talking to a 13yo about his penis. Yes stealing the underwear was wrong, but now he has been shamed and hopefully learned his lesson, if op finds them again, that would be the time to talk to his son. As I said in yet another comment.",

I'm not gunna say I never did stupid shit as a kid but I feel like at 15 I was more mentally aware of stuff like that.  I dont mean this to be offensive I just don't think that's healthy. are you a Christian family like did you instil in him not to have sex before marriage I feel like i was just more into like having a girlfriend and physical interaction at that age rather then experimenting with shampoo I feel like that's more a younger thing but who knows I matured very early.",

Or not knowing, that's all he had access to. So when I found it, I told him that will burn, and bought him some actual lube, if he's going to do it, fine but use the right thing.

But before you have kids, have a house and a stable job with savings, if you star out behind you will struggle to keep up, from experience. Also you are young, you do not have to have gf right now. You date multiple people, that does not mean sleep around. It means get to know multiple people until you find the most compatible. Then you date them solely, you do not have to live together right away, you continue to get to know each other, then you live together, that's when you really get to know if that's who you want yo marry and have kids with. Less chance of normal problems you read on here. I did it the other way, no money, shitty apartment I could barely afford taking care of a kid that wasn't mine at 19, then at 21 my daughter was born but not planned, two years later my son. Make sure you are ready. If you can't take care of yourself you will not be able to support a baby.",

We've all been through those growing pains but it's not okay to invade other peoples privacy or involve other people in it (even indirectly like this) without their consent.\n\nIt's going to be an awkward talk and he's most likely going to be defensive and/or evasive about it (kids aren't exactly known for owning up to their transgressions) and he might get mad when confronted about it. Just don't let his anger or attempts at dodging responsibility make *you* angry. Frustrating as they can be, they're normal reactions from an embarrassed kid. Getting mad at them in discussions about inappropriate behavior (especially with something like this where they haven't really figured out where all the boundaries are yet) tends to lead to them focusing on your reaction rather than their behavior. Staying calm while you tell them that they need to stop whatever dumb shit they're doing tends to get the point across better.",

My -now DH, figured he was too young to know what he was really looking at, and that they were just at his level, until he 'accidently' fell into me at a totally non falling moment and got handsy. One other time he came over unannounced and I was off, so I did some extra lady-care that morning, and he was in the hallway peeking into my bedroom, while his mom waited in the driveway. I robed up, and marched right out to her to have a talk. She was mortified. I wasn't about to humiliate the kid, but that was a violation I didn't appreciate. She made sure to have him or her text before coming again.  \nPlease don't ignore this. If you expect this woman to stick around, he needs to see her as someone to be respected not as a play thing for either of you.   \nWhile he is exploring and I'm sure she understands that, it's still degrading to be treated as an object tho. And since we're in the days of girls being sent home from school for what they wear, instead of teaching boys to respect them and not ogle them. Make sure he knows that women are people just like him, and could likely kick his ass for stuff like this Lol. (Just reminding you, I do feel like you're prepared to be on top of all this, as you should. Sex and such should be an ongoing conversation, not just presented when kids do something gross or surprise us with a question. You'll do great.

Is that something he would have expected?\n\nBecause to me that is a violation of HIS boundaries, and if that is normal for your family I find it unsurprising that he doesn't respect other peoples boundaries.     \n\nI am not saying this as a defense for his actions, which constitute clearly inacceptible behaviour and need to be adressed accordingly.    I would do this first. \n\nThen, after that (preferably on another day) maybe this would be a good time for having a family meeting and setting rules and boundaries as a family some of which EVERYONE in the house is expected to follow. This can be about said boundaries but also about general rules around how everyone should treat each other for a good and peaceful enviroment, and the consequences for not following them. \n\n[I find this article to be quite well sourced and helpful](https://www.verywellfamily.com/establishing-house-rules-for-teenagers-1094873)\n\nI would include him in these talks and let him contribute his ideas. The goal should be for everyone to feel involved in the process of establishing rules and therefore be more likely to comply willingly. \n\nThis might also be a good time to talk about trust, and how it relates to the extent of privacy you are able to grant him. \n\n\"You are growing up to be an adult so I want you to be able to have a private space for yourself, but as your father I also still carry responsibility for your safety and the safety of this house and everyone in it. \nSo if you have a space for yourself in this house I need to trust that you won't use it to hide any stolen or illegal items. If I can't do that or you give me reason to believe you are breaking the rules that you agreed to abide by I have the right and the obligation to violate your privacy for yours and others wellbeing\" \n\nHope this helps a bit, parenting teenagers can be a real challenge for everyone involved, but I have no doubt that you and your family is going to manage just fine.",

But I absolutely would not want to be part of that conversation. That would only increase my own humiliation and discomfort. Rule #1 of apologies and making amends is if the act of making amends will make the situation worse, don't do it. Perhaps the gf would appreciate an apology, or being part of the painfully awkward conversation that OP desperately needs to have with the son. Perhaps she wouldn't. But she needs to be consulted before OP makes unilateral decisions here.\n\nAlso OP, maybe move the dirty laundry hamper from the bathroom.",

That said, if he didn't tell her and she found out in the future (ie if the kid doesn't stop, and she catches him and finds out dad knew), she would be livid (justifiably so). If it were me, finding out after the fact would end the relationship. So that's a question of weighing the risks.",

At 13, I knew the difference between acceptable and unacceptable, and not once did I ever steal the underwear of anyone to whom I was attracted, despite having plenty of opportunities to do so, be it at sleepovers or parties or whatever.\n\nI was incredibly horny and I completely understand how difficult those hormones make rational thought, but I never crossed a line that I knew was wrong. It\u2019s one thing to be horny and imagine doing shit like this, but actually doing it is disrespectful and gross and borderline predatory.\n\nIf a grown man did this to someone, it\u2019d be disgusting and treated as sexual harassment (rightfully so). A child has done this, and because of their age they\u2019re afforded a pass from it being sexual harassment, but it\u2019s still absolutely unacceptable behavior and it is imperative that it be nipped in the bud sooner rather than later.\n\nAnd I don\u2019t really think there\u2019s anything wrong with the women of this thread being grossed out by it, I\u2019m grossed out by it. His dad\u2019s gf is basically his stepmother, and stealing her underwear was a very deliberate and sexual action, and the fact that he hid the evidence proves he knows it was wrong. I don\u2019t really like your use of the term \u201cfemale\u201d as if we\u2019re animals subject to just our basal instincts. It\u2019s very incel-y.\n\nAnd this line,\n\n> Your transposing your adult female ideas onto a normal, teenage boy.\n\n\nNo. She\u2019s transposing society\u2019s expectations that sexual boundaries be strictly respected by all parties onto an abnormal, pervy teenage boy. This reeks of \u201cboys will be boys\u201d vibes. This isn\u2019t innocent boy behavior, this is something that very likely could precede truly harmful predatory behavior in this guy\u2019s future. Don\u2019t excuse his actions, they\u2019re gross.",

I suspect the little bit that you\u2019re off by is due to generational differences in how we treat and view women as a society. Hear me loud and clear: **you are part of the problem.**\n\nYou can call me irrational or just emotional or whatever, but that doesn\u2019t make me those things. If you are truly trained in this field, you should recognize your own problematic behavior and views towards women. I say this all to say I\u2019m not insulting you, but rather begging you to listen to reason here.\n\nYou admit that what he did was wrong. Great, full agreement. But you did excuse his actions. \n\n> She\u2019s a female and her stuff is available and he has raging hormones.\n\n\nWhat would you call this? A justification? Excuse? Mitigating circumstances? Whatever you label it, it *is* an excuse for his behavior. There is no excuse for knowingly violating someone\u2019s boundaries, which is exactly what was done here. Do you disagree?\n\nIf we agree there, I think we should also agree that he doesn\u2019t need it \u201cbeaten into him\u201d per se, but it *absolutely* does need to be made clear that what he did was wrong and it was wrong because it was sexually predatory. Period. He needs to understand that he crossed a sexual boundary.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be an adult male, that\u2019s irrelevant. Why do you think that it matters whether a woman or a man tells this kid that he did something sexually predatory, and that that was wrong?",

An apology is acknowledging you did something wrong, you feel bad about it, you won't (or will attempt to not) let it happen again. I agree suggesting it as a path to healing for everyone involved can be beneficial. However, forcing someone to apologize is just dressing up your righteous anger in a public shaming.\n\nDefinitely setting some boundaries (without shaming) would be helpful for this family.",

He can even apologise by proxy through dad, that would be fine, too. You're right, it shouldn't be forced but he needs to realise what he did wasn't okay and that he has to find other outlets than hamper-diving when he gets horny ^^",

(This happened to a friend of mine and she found out her husband had a cocaine problem years into their marriage when she was pregnant with their second child). Result? Divorce.\n\nI hide that I fuck prostitutes because if she knew she\u2019d freak out and leave me. (This happened to two friends and their husbands both fucked prostitutes and hid it from their wives). Result? Divorce for both couples.\n\nI hide the fact that I am attracted to men because if my girlfriend knew, she\u2019d leave me. (A male friend of mine from high school did not tell his girlfriend who later became his wife that he was bisexual until many years into their marriage.) Result? Divorce. My friend is now openly bisexual.\n\nYou don\u2019t get to trick people into building a life with you based on lies and deceit. In all the real situations that my friends went through, the relationships never stood a chance because one person decided they weren\u2019t ready to be judged. In the end, not one relationship survived, many people got hurt, divorce financially ruined one of my friends in particular, and it ALL could have been prevented if there had been honestly from the beginning.\n\nThere are loads of people who are okay with doing drugs, or having open marriages, or being with someone bisexual or who has a particular fetish. \n\nWhen I met my husband I smoked and he hated that. I didn\u2019t lie and hide it and pretend like I didn\u2019t smoke just to get him to go out with me. I told him that I wouldn\u2019t smoke when I was with him and that I wanted to try to quit. I was honest and told the truth, and if he didn\u2019t like me, that was that. In the end, I did quit and I have been smoke-free ever since. I can guarantee that he would be LIVID and feel very betrayed if this far into our marriage he found out that I was lying the whole time and that I smoked in secret when he wasn\u2019t around because \u201cif I told him the truth he would freak out and break up with me.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t try to justify lying. It\u2019s not ok and only dooms the relationship from the start.",

How you equate awkward conversations with your parents to failing at school (90% ???!!) is beyond me. I didn't have a very healthy childhood and my one sex talk involved my dad describing every intricate detail of dicks that you could ever imagine, but how does that screw you up for life?

Why are you so concerned about HIS feelings when the dad\u2019s girlfriend will probably have a lot of horrible feelings for a long time because of this.

Your comment is big Brock Turner\u2019s Dad energy. \n\nBy the way, my (new) underwear was stolen by a family member over a decade ago. I didn\u2019t even know who did it for several years, and I can\u2019t even describe how violated and sick I felt and STILL feel.\n\nETA: I do think OP needs to communicate from a place of love with his son.

But you're talking as if he committed a rape or something.\n\nTeenage boys do shit like this, they're hormonal and horny and they're still learning how to human properly. It is almost inevitable that a teenage boy will cross some boundary or another in a wildly inappropriate manner simply because they're still learning what boundaries are. What matters is that the parent(s) use it as a teachable moment; they explain that the behavior was wrong and why. If the parent has done that to the best of their ability and it persists then therapy may be in order (you can't just let it continue and a psychologist who specializes in child/teen development may be your best bet to figuring this out).\n\nPoint is, yeah it's creepy and gross and wrong, I know that and you know that. But when dealing with kids/teens you gotta ask \"but does the kid know that?\" and then react accordingly. It's likely OP's son just thought of it that \"I didn't do anything to anyone, I did something to some underwear but underwear don't have feelings\". Sometimes, even if they understand about needing consent for sex they don't understand that that applies to using people's belongings in a such a manner as well.",

And also you can enquire as to where they are. Girl 2, if you wanted to kiss her/touch her/whatever, you could say \"I really want to do ___ right now\" if the vibe is right, and she could encourage you or turn you down, depending on where her boundaries are. \n\nYou don't need to push boundaries, just find out where they actually are, and get consent.",

This all started when I was in my early teens, getting into things that he didn\u2019t know how to connect with. \n\nOne day he found texts describing sexual acts I wanted to preform with my gf at the time. He was furious, drove me to a dark park and parked the car, and proceeded to yell at me. I never truly understood why he was upset until years later because he didn\u2019t properly communicate with me. \n\nI would not avoid clear communication. If you try to avoid the awkwardness, your message could get lost in translation of however you try to broach the subject. Sit him down. Tell him exactly how this makes you feel, makes her feel, and ask him how he feels. Proceed to set boundaries and encourage him to talk with you.\n\nASK HIM IF HE NEEDS A MINUTE TO PROCESS HIS FEELINGS. \n\nI\u2019m not this way, but I know many people that need to figure out their feelings before being able to talk about them. \n\nLastly, don\u2019t approach this from a place of anger, distrust, or aggression. It will instantly shutdown the conversation and turn it into a lecture. Make sure it remains a conversation so you can lead him to the correct thought process. I.e stealing is bad; invading privacy is bad; consent for sexual acts is mandatory; communication is of the utmost importance etc. etc.\n\nYour son will thank you for it later in life.\n\nEdit: clarification of background\n\nEdit 2: I\u2019m really glad my first award comes from a place of honesty. Thanks friends.",

Not necessarily because he's got the hots for the gf but because it's taboo and the closest thing he can get to the real thing. I just don't feel like the kid is a deviant therefore telling him that the gf is now freaked out by his behavior he will internalize that and be embarrassed, ashamed, under by his choices, etc. It's never a good idea to make your child hate themselves or feel like they're a fuck up.",

I see all these people conjuring up nightmare scenario's of the kid turning in to a panty stealing, peeping tom, rapist degenerate and I think they are jumping to conclusions. Being thirteen is a very weird age in sexual development, you conjure up all kinds of horny scenarios with people you shouldn't have those feelings about, heck, I know that I was aroused by a neighbour in het 40s, a French teacher with huge breasts (and nothing else going for her) and even a cousin at some point. The fact that the son fantasises or had fantasised about his father's partner, isn't unnatural in and of itself. He shouldn't be shamed for that. That's his private life. However, when he stole her panties and masturbated in them, he crossed a boundary and he should know that that isn't okay because it makes her, OP (and him probably) very uncomfortable. If you come from a place of understanding, this message is much clearer to get across. And OP, just to reassure you, I turned out relatively okay, those taboo fantasies faded and were replaced with other unspeakable kinks. ;-)",

Its as if they are scared from male sexuality and healthy normal urges. Of course a 13 year old kid is going to have a thing for the woman in the household, especially if she is hot. But of course he knows the boundaries. Shaming boys for having urges seems to be normalized now, what a weird and fucked society of boys we are raising, Jesus. People seem to forget what it was like as a teen. Boys AND girls are both a nightmare of constant sex thinking and horniness and creepiness. And nothing wrong with that. Shaming them is for sure the wrong move here. It was the dads responsibility to have a quick word man to man and to forget all about it.",

To give a random example: I\u2019m a woman, and I don\u2019t get why guys are insecure about their dick size. I would not instinctively feel like it\u2019s a big deal if a woman tells her boyfriend that he has a small dick. But I know men feel like it is a big deal to them, and I respect that even though I don\u2019t understand it. It would be cruel of me to go around saying it\u2019s not a big deal just because I don\u2019t have a dick so I don\u2019t get it. All I want is for men to have the same respect and understanding towards things that negatively affect women, even if you don\u2019t instinctively understand it from your male perspective.

It depends how serious her relationship is with the Dad, it's definitely simpler and less awkward for her to take off if she wants to. Your responses makes me doubt you've ever had kids and you certainly don't remember being 13. The kid absolutely is innocent, he made a mistake and needs to seriously be told that. He also knew on some levels it was wrong and already feels guilty, just not how wrong and that's what needs to be corrected and communicated. If you think humiliating him is necessary, you have issues. We don't know what else the Dad said to GF in the serious conversation they had, I don't think the awkward joke was the end of it. The physically damaged party is an inanimate object, the awkwardness that may kill the relationship with the son/dad is the threat and is real. If the \"grossed out\" factor is actually the biggest deal to her then she like you needs to grow up. I'm not suggesting avoiding the conversations at all, they need to be had to move on and it will be tough, not sure if it's worth it to GF, I wouldn't blame her if it's not. Feeling unsafe in this situation, is absurd. Kid took panties and is obviously a rapist right? lol smfh.",

Because kids' subconsciousness treats a broken connection as a life threatening situation, and can be very traumatic.\n\nThe gf is adult and should be responsible for her emotions. The kid is the most fragile party here, and should be unconditionally supported here by both. And only after the topic is comfortable to be discussed by both, the adult and the kid, it can be discussed in a context of boundaries.\n\nAdults should not become kids. They should stay adults, take responsibility and protect kids. Until the kids reach 18. Otherwise they'll grow up traumatized. Childhood traumas are rough and fuck up lives.",

It was awkward and bothersome but somehow I know now in my 30s that I wouldn't have had those conversations without the element of the truck. And my dad is really nice... he never really wanted to be a dad, but he embraced it sorta. Just like how I never wanted to be born but here we are. My mom super wanted a kid, I was mostly planned for years. Then he was almost 40 and bam he's a dad now.\n\nThose rides in the truck were awkward, but it gave us undivided time together where we could talk for hours. I'm not saying this method is for everyone, and according to some comments I've read it might even be wrong for some people. But it was right for me.\n\nThe only long talk without the truck was the obligatory birds and bees talk. One warm summer night about 14 or 15 years old he grabbed a 6 pack of beer and said \"let's go out back and just talk. Yes. Its the talk.\" And we had a beer and watched the sunset and he said \"you give me the talk and I'll chime when necessary\" it was awkward but it was a memory I smile about. At one point he said \"you know more than I planned to tell you.. I think you got it. Let's finish these and watch the sunset\" and we continued to talk about mostly unimportant stuff but sometimes I'd chime in with a sex question and he'd answer it and back to small talk.\n\nFor a dude that didn't want to be a dad, and I kinda resented as a kid for reasons not in this story, we understand each other and I love him for it. We both awkward dudes. But he approached the awkward with love, empathy, and usually forgiveness.",

I also didn't pick up the phone to call him. He lived a mile away. Either of us could've picked up the phone or gone over, and while it seems cold and distanced to engage in that behavior,  now that I'm about the age he was, I see how time flies by and 6 months happens fast. He was caught in the rapids of time and didn't realize how much time had passed. He worked 6 days a week and when you get older the days get longer and the years get shorter. I forgave him a few years ago because i felt the pull of time and how fast life gets once you're in a steady routine. Plus he was never mean or rude to me, just busy.",

Also, the bathroom is useful for privacy and the toilet is useful for disposing of biological messes.\"  \n\n\nYounger stepson also gets told \"You have no secrets from the person who washes your laundry\" but more along the lines of \"so you need to get better about wiping after pooping. You're already bigger than me, and it's *mean* to expect me to wash the poop out of your underwear all the time just because you want to hurry back to your video games. Next time I'm setting it all aside and you can was the poop out yourself with a bucket and soap.\"  \n\n\nI hated having to follow through on that, but spending some time with a bucket full of soapy water and his own poopy underwear seemed to make it clear to him that, no really, actions have consequences and it's way easier to just take a minute to wipe!",

Yup, that was exactly how it went.  \n\n\nBefore I got a mini-washer that hooks up to the kitchen sink, we had to occasionally wash clothing in the bathtub, though without the old-timey tools that would make it easier, like a laundry paddle and a scrub board and a wringer. I'd do as much of the work as possible, but the boys would help because I'm a bit crippled and weak while they're sturdy and strong.  \n\n\nSo kiddo was already familiar with the process, and a bucket was sized better for a small pile of underwear, instead of using the whole bathtub.  \n\n\nAnd when he'd gotten the worst of it out, I tossed them in the mini-washer to get them properly clean. He did a good job of it too. Cried a bit because he didn't want to, but buckled down and got the necessary work done to fix the problem he himself had created.  \n\n\nPlus, made sure to talk to him about it. Made sure he understood that this isn't about punishment, it's about learning that hygiene is important and that actions have consequences. We talked about how he's going to be responsible for cleaning his own underwear for most of his entire life, so he may as well learn now not to leave giant stains for himself.  \n\n\nPoor kid had already had a few episodes where he'd loudly insisted that something smelled bad, would force everyone to drop what they're doing and help him find the smell, and every time it was his own ass he was smelling!  \n\n\nSo yeah, better that problem gets handled at 13yo, instead of waiting until he's like 21yo and out on his own stinking up the rest of society with poopy.  \n\n\nAnd I'm still pretty annoyed at his abusive/neglectful bio-mom, who had sole custody of him when he was little and failed to teach him how to not be poopy when he was like 2 or 3yo.",

He was **13 years old** and bigger than me already.   \n\n\nSo it wasn't a little bit of poop on tiny little underwear. Massive smears on adult-sized briefs.   \n\n\nSometimes he just wouldn't wipe *at all*, a fact we discovered when he forgot to flush because *omg video game!*  \n\n\nI wouldn't put used toilet paper through my mini washing machine that hooks up to the kitchen sink, so why would it be okay for someone to use cloth as an hours-long butt-wiper and then make me wash that for them?  \n\n\nHumiliation wasn't the point. Cleaning up the mess he was making was the point.  \n\n\nTalking didn't change his habits. Nothing involving only words could convince him to change his habits. I tried for a very long time, and it just kept getting worse, until the kid would stop playing his game to say \"Something smells bad!\" Would force the entire family to stop and help him find the bad smell, and every single time it was just his own poopy butt.  \n\n\nSo yeah, actions, consequences. He kept generating very poopy underwear because he had no reason to change his habits besides my nagging, so fine, it became his job to clean the very poopy underwear. He was bigger than me, stronger than me, and perfectly capable of doing simple housework.  \n\n\nAnd if he wanted to get into the practice of walking around with shit in his pants, he may as well get accustomed to the consequences of cleaning those stains.  \n\n\nFunny enough, he decided the 20 extra seconds of video game time immediately after pooping wasn't actually worth the trade off of scrubbing his own shit stains, so yeah, easier to just actually take time to wipe his ass after pooping like everybody else does.",

And then let it go and don't give him a hard time about it, it will only be awkward if you make it awkward. \n\nBeing a young teenager means you will do lots of very stupid stuff because sexuality is not something you fully understand, you think you are so sneaky about it but you are way less subtle about it than you realize, he has to learn about it, and he will learn at his own pace, please don't punish him for it, hell show him the wonders of incognito mode if you deem it necessary",

Ok.  I have a feeling that over time, GF and OP and OP's son will ALL wish that OP could have handled things differently.  GF will probably feel like she rather would have never learned that his son was jerking off to her.  I mean, she's outta there ASAP.\n\nWhen you grow up, you're probably going to learn that your parents hid some things from you.  It's because they have your best interests at heart and they are trying to do their best by you, hopefully.  Being 100% honest all of the time isn't always the best thing to do for everyone, especially when it comes to the well being of a child.",

If he was curious too he could very easily have seen them in the laundry basket and just had a sudden brainwave. \n\nI think it's more likely that he was smelling or something than wearing, because even when curious about trying things on, I dont think I ever thought to wear someone's dirty underwear, but hey, hormones are a hell of a drug.",

(Im not saying he's doing this, or ever would, im just saying what this could potentially turn into..) \n\nYes it will be embarrassing, for you and your son, but thats what you signed up for when u became a parent.\n\nAlso if you haven't had the sex talk with him yet, do it!!! Not just because of this situation, but because kids are getting exposed to sex and or porn way sooner with each generation it seems.. the amount of 13-14 year olds that are having sex is scary... \n\nAnd please dont be one of those parents that just tell their son to wrap it up and they are good to go!!! Make sure he understands consent!! And all the other things!!!",

Leaving it unspoken just leaves more questions in his head.  \n\nI also think it was a bigger violation with them being dirty underwear versus stealing her clean underwear.  \n\nYou don't need to punish him (\"No more masturbation for SIX MONTHS\").  The talk is deterrence enough for similar behavior.  \n\nThat's the best option.  \n\nIf this was a multiple choice test, there would be an option for the obviously bad advice.  That option might something like:  eliminate your son because he has now been identified as a close proximity male competitor for your girlfriend.  Don't do that.",

We dont really separate clothes as much as I feel like I did when I was younger. Like I don\u2019t separate whites so I can use bleach. I do separate delicates, workout clothes, and like towels and stuff though. \n\nGrowing up, laundry was a family chore and we each did loads of mixed clothing and towels and what not. It was whoever needed a particular item washed or whoever was asked to take care of it usually. \n\nAnd do single adults or new college students not have enough laundry to do on their own? Idk how one gets from 13 to 18 (or whatever age) to suddenly accumulate \u201cenough\u201d clothing. I\u2019ve always just adjusted water levels to accommodate what needed to be cleaned\u2026",

Porn has probably been watched. Take him for road trip. I had the best conversations with my kids in the car one on one.\nI would start with, hey buddy I  know this is awkward but we need to talk.  Then talk about respecting women and not taking things that isn't theirs. No shame, no discipline. Just talk but get that point across.You want to make it easy for him to talk with you and ask questions. Tell him that no question is stupid and you learn by asking. Tell him porn is not how the majority of people have sex. Tell him its okay to be curious but it matters what he does to appease the curiosity.  Etc.etc. etc.  You definitely need him to feel safe. Tell him that the girlfriend doesn't need to know all the details of his questions.   Talk about safe sex, if a girl says no...she means no. Also I would provide him with condoms so he could figure them out before he is actually going to use one. Any way you get the idea. Just use this  time to set boundaries and to have a talk. \n\nOh and he is old enough to do his own laundry. Lol\n\nSigned...experienced parent",

Sharing a beer with your boy as \"he becomes a man\"? Well I wouldn't wish for anything different. He isn't perfect and neither am I. He had me tell him the birds and the bees. He corrected me about a few things but that is one of our most awkward yet most favorite conversations. \n\nOne time I came out as gay and he said \"you're not gay.\" And I was upset and said \"see? You don't support me!\" And he said \"if you were gay I'd support you, and you might be bi, but you're not gay. You've liked girls your entire life. If you found a newfound attraction to guys I'll love you anyway, but I've known you longer than you've known you and you're not gay\"\n\nThat upset me because I thought I was gay. 6 months later I have a girlfriend. He was right. And he said sorta the right things. In my literal mindset I'd said that I don't like girls. And in his equally literal mindset I still liked girls and he was right. I do like girls. Always have. But for 6 months I liked guts. Then I realized what he'd always known: in probably bi. And he supports it if I wanna do that. Married in a hetero relationship nearly 18 years to a girl that prefers her own gender over mine. We complete each other. I can wear hairpins etc. She can wear baggy skater clothes.

Step mom/sister is one of the biggest genres in porn right now, so you encounter it at the front of every tube site. I mean, sure, maybe porn had nothing to do with it at all. But it also wouldn't surprise me if he saw some of this stuff and thought that lusting after your step-mom and stealing dirty panties is a normal thing that boys do. It took me approximately 30 seconds right now to find multiple videos where the plot is that the boy jerks off with the step-mom's panties, she catches him, and they have sex as a result. At 13 years of age, you cannot expect boys to be able to properly distinguish between porn and reality. I certainly couldn't and it heavily shaped my view of sexuality for years to come.\n\nSo yeah, properly another good topic to bring up during that awkward conversation OP is hopefully going to have lol.",

Of course that kink has existed for a long time, but if what you said was 100% true, then there would have had to have been a huge uptick of people who suddenly wanted to bang their step relatives in the mid 2010s when that genre absolutely went through the roof in popularity. Whereas in reality, it's a two-way street and positive feedback loops do happen with online content of any kind. It all starts with nudging: Many users are simply happy to click on the first thumbnail that catches their eye on the front page. Maybe they're not even into the whole \"fauxcest\" thing (yet) but they like the actress. Then the feedback that the site gets is still: A lot of people watched this video, so the conclusion naturally is: \"Let's make more of the same!\" And even a minority of users can drive content generation if they just watch a lot more than the average user. \n\n\nAnd this point stands, no matter what: The content you consume influences your thinking, expectations, and preferences. If you don't agree with that statement, you're simply unaware of the process.\n\nAgain: Can I say for sure that porn was involved here? Of course not, I'm not a clairvoyant. I'm just saying it wouldn't surprise me in the least.",

How you handle this talk could be critical to deciding that.\n\nI understand it's a tricky balancing act, but this is the moment to discuss boundaries, consent, appropriate versus inappropriate interactions and find a more suitable option for your sons use of female underwear.\n\nPlease don't down play this moment when it should be used for critical education.",

Wow. I would be so disgusted if this happened to me and I would want to know that a serious talk and consequences happened before I felt comfortable in my home again.

It\u2019s not like he\u2019s 10, he\u2019s most likely watched porn by this age and might have even started having sex. People that are acting like he is \u201conly\u201d 13 probably haven\u2019t had young men growing up in their home, they are more than capable of knowing right from wrong and what appropriate boundaries are. \n\nThis makes me so uncomfortable for OP\u2019s gf I hope they can come up with a good solution, it would be sad for their relationships to fall apart over this but it is really serious if you ask me. I know that might sound like an overreaction and I\u2019m not saying they should break up over it or anything but I would want a sincere apology from the son (no matter how awkward) and to feel reassured that it wouldn\u2019t happen again.

This isn't a justification or a defence, but at 13 he would probably have whacked it to an overly curvaceous watermelon if the opportunity presented. I don't think its an issue of him specifically targeting the dad's girlfriends underwear, he made a poor decision driven by hormones and immaturity.

Of course they need correction.

If he gets a girlfriend later in life, and she wants to share her underwear thats great! But you can\u2019t go around nicking peoples knickers. Should he formally apologize? Maybe- if thats what you and the GF think is necessary, personally think it might shame him super hard in a bad way. He\u2019s already going to have trouble looking her in the eye after you guys talk, at least for a little while. Maybe have a talk about what he can do to occupy his brain when those thoughts happen, feels weird to say \u201ctell your son to use the internet.\u201d But if thats the kind of relationship you guys have, go for it.",

It's her stuff she has the right to know. It's not a BIG BIG deal but it is enough of a big deal to warrant at least a conversation. \nThe gain is that talking with his son is letting her know he respects her and is teaching his son that what he did was wrong and why. And then he learns and life goes on. \nAnd that part that he will forget, but it will be on the back of her mind all the time? What is that? \n \n\"Woman can't handle the truth because we have feelings or are too fragile to handle reality so \"we\"  must protect them by hiding anything that could upset them.

I don\u2019t know if you can imagine what that feels like to a young woman, but I\u2019ll tell you. I felt absolutely horrified and disgusted. Not only was he going into my room and stealing my things, which is bad enough, but the knowledge that I was the object of this person\u2019s sexual fantasies was beyond disturbing. I felt victimized, and the fact that nobody did anything about it made me feel very helpless and angry. \n\n Maybe I\u2019m hard-hearted about it, but I think your son should feel shame for what he did, because, well\u2026 it is WRONG. He needs to know that it is NOT ok to steal from others, it\u2019s not ok to violate someone\u2019s boundaries by going into their room (if that\u2019s where he got them). His sexual fantasies are his own; if he wants to fantasize about your gf, that\u2019s his business- but once it crosses over into the real world, he is violating a very serious boundary and this cannot be ignored. Your conversation should not be awkward or sugar coated. He needs to hear that what he did was fucked up, and that he will be punished if he does it again.",

None of them as young as 31, and I was not tempted to go on any panty-stealing missions, but I found some of them attractive and, while I was going through puberty, having my own problems with grief, girls, school, etc, it was not necessarily an enjoyable thing for me to witness my father's new-released adult sexuality first-hand at this time. \n\nI have, of course, absolutely no idea as to your own personal and family context, and mean no judgement here whatsoever. We do what we have to do, we only live once, etc. \n\nYour son is a developing person with an emerging sexuality, and you've introduced into the mix a relatively young, probably attractive woman, of no relation to him. He obviously likes her, as per the joke in your post. There may or may not be some kind of competitive dynamic between you and your son; there often is, your communication may or may not be usually good; often it isn't, between males, I've found. \n\nThere is then the porn factor, which is hard to know, but contemporary porn is absolutely rife with these kind of psuedo family taboo setups. In a 'conventional' nuclear family, the chance for sexual opportunism (eg stealing panties) is usually quite low or protected by relationships and familial bonds; when families separate these sometimes do as well. The sexual stuff can be pure skeevy opportunism or a way to relieve some emotional pain, or both. \n\nWhilst your girlfriend deserves to know about it, I do feel it's remiss of you not to have spoken to your son first. He is your son after all - you may wish your gf a part of your life for a while but he will be until the end. At the moment, he probably does understand why your gf is suddenly awkward around him, because he's put two and two together, but it hasn't been explained to him, so he probably feels quite ashamed. He needs to feel some shame but not for it to drag on, so two and two don't add up to twelve, as it were. Your girlfriend is an adult and should be able to get over it with time; it might be an awkward one for a while, maybe eventually it'll be a funny story. Your son may feel now that you have essentially taken her side in this.  \n\nObvious hindsight here, forgive me, but maybe the easy location of the laundry basket is not a good idea - it's a little like (tho less severe) keeping a child protected from a dog or something, you have to maybe have some care around physical boundaries as well as communicating behavioural ones.",

He may think he\u2019s doing nothing wrong. And maybe nobody has told him anything regarding sex. So how would he know wrong from right when things are distorted. How would he make the connection that that would be harassment when nobody has told him otherwise? This boy may just be confused because to him it was just underwear when nobody was home. Again, let me say I\u2019m not defending him. When I was in school nobody told me any information other than sex=bad. I\u2019m advocating for more education when it comes to sex and fetishes, why do I keep getting downvoted? How are people supposed to learn without proper discourse? Young boys need more education on how to respect privacy of others and what is right and wrong. I know for a fact there isn\u2019t enough education, especially in todays world.",

I told him that we would not go through his things and that he could buy underwear or obtain it consensually without any judgment from us, but that stealing it is not acceptable.  I wrote that after this letter, I would never bring this up again and that I forgive him and love him.  I let his mother (my girlfriend) read it and then I gave it to him.  He didn't come out of his room for a full day, then apologized.  I just nodded and told him that is the end of it for me, and we moved on.  It never came up again.",

It violates his gfs trust and privacy and I can't imagine how she must feel - degraded, humiliated.\n\nThe gf doesn't owe him, a random teenage boy, the chance to learn and grow sexually. If OP does not confront this kid for this (which, Jesus Christ, is not normal!) he is both a shitty father and a shitty bf.\n\n*edit\n\nJesus Christ people, this woman isn't responsible for making this kid's violation a teachable moment. Fuck out of here with that. Women's bodies don't exist as a wonderland for men to walk around in and make discoveries about their sexuality. That's what consenting partners are for.",

This isn\u2019t something fantasy thing that played out in his head. He went into someone\u2019s private space (their bathroom), went through their private things to find worn underwear so he could masturbate with them.\n\nWere you born yesterday, fully formed and incapable of listening to women? Do you not recognize that he stole her dirty underwear basically so he could smell her private areas non-consensually? He didn\u2019t take underwear from the clean drawer, not that that would be ok either. He got dirty underwear, and the people who do that do so for a reason. The implications make it worse than just \u201cstealing\u201d and fantasizing about your step mom.\n\nIf you found out that a child who is supposed to view you as (at the very least) an adult authority figure actually had so little respect for you that they were stealing from you on the off chance that they might get a whiff of your genitals to masturbate to, you would have to be insane, or totally lacking in appropriate boundaries not to find that degrading and disrespectful behavior. Son needs a serious intervention because this behavior is not ok. If he continues to act like it\u2019s ok to show a total lack of regard for boundaries or the feelings of the women he\u2019s nonconsenually sexualizing, or even if he just lacks the self control and empathy to understand how his actions impact the people around him, it will be a serious problem.\n\nChalking this kind of thing up to \u201cBoys will be boys\u201d is just the prequel to pulling a Brock Turner\u2019s father and whining about how your child, now an adult, shouldn\u2019t have his life ruined over \u201c20 minutes of action\u201d. For God\u2019s sake. Talk to your kids early and often about age appropriate topics surrounding sex and sexuality, including consent. Don\u2019t leave them with the impression that anything you want to do to get your nut is fair game - far too many men in these comments seem to be operating under that delusion. Hopefully then you won\u2019t end up in this kind of situation. If you do, it\u2019s now your job to impress upon your child how serious it is that you get consent before involving people in their sexual activities.",

A 13 year old knows better, they know that it\u2019s a violation of privacy. He knows that\u2019s your girlfriend and he shouldn\u2019t be doing anything remotely sexual with her (or her clothes). Anyone who says to potter around his feelings because he might feel \u201cshame\u201d is crazy. He should feel remorse for violating a woman\u2019s privacy, and he should feel ashamed for stealing someone\u2019s (who didn\u2019t consent) clothes to jack off in to. he\u2019s actually old enough to be sexually active with people his own age, so who knows if this weird behavior is translating in to those relationships as well.

You would not be so casual with this if she was your wife. \n\nAlso, that\u2019s not normal puberty behavior. It\u2019s a major violation of trust and consent. It\u2019s creepy and I can\u2019t think of a single woman who would handle this so casually. \n\n2) You need to be talking to your son now. Not talking to him is disrespectful to your gf. \n\nThis shouldn\u2019t be a \u201chaha hormones\u201d talk. It should be a serious talk about consent, boundaries and respecting others.  \n\nPut yourself in your gf\u2019s shoes and imagine someone stealing something intimate of yours to masturbate with.

I\u2019m sure if men these days had the kind of guidance and support and the knowledge that it\u2019s ok to have feelings and express them they\u2019d be better for it. \nLooking back on my adolescent years made me realize my parents barely guided me in life because their authoritative tactics didn\u2019t teach me anything but \u201cbecause I said so that\u2019s why\u201d. It didn\u2019t make me feel ok to express myself or lean on them when I needed direction in life. All it did was make me want to rebel. Being a parent is quite a big deal. You can shape this young man to be a confident adult male who respects women, and boundaries amongst many other things just from talking to him and pointing him in the right direction. It may be a bit uncomfortable but not addressing it shows him that he didn\u2019t do anything wrong and shows your gf that you don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal. Trust that she totally feels that it\u2019s a BIG deal and should things of that nature reoccur I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll play out well for your relationship with her. Best of luck OP.",

However I would encourage you to think about it from his perspective. He's 13, likely only just around the time of discovering sexuality and what avenues are available to him.\n\nOn the one hand, there's Dad with the new girlfriend (I assume the Mother isn't around so there is obviously the concept of the nuclear family not there which is nobody's fault, just what it is). So your kid has the avenues of the internet and his friends with which to start formulating a world view with regards to sex.\n\nI urge you to google even some straightforward keywords in relation to pornography. Half of it is step sibling or stepmother stuff and regardless of the kinks of people at large, he sees this and that does go into formulating a world view.\n\nThe world is actually a fairly hostile place for young boys and men coming up and he is likely already ashamed of his own sexual identity. So there is already hiding going on and the likelihood is that once he finds out that you both know, his shame is going to go through the roof. \n\nThe only real reaction to that is to be a lot more hidden about himself and ultimately that's the landmark where you never really know where he's going to turn to in terms of research or outlet. At the moment you do and yes it isn't right but he is 13. He doesn't know that yet.\n\nAll I'm saying is instead of coming at him and being angry, telling him this is bad behaviour and admonishing him, could I suggest a softer approach? The first would be to assure him that he's not in trouble, nor will his story be told far and wide (like on reddit), but a conversation does need to happen that the behaviour should not happen again. Added, he's very likely come across various types of pornography. Isn't this the best time to put all of that into context? Assure him that this is not real world and the reality of sex and the girlfriends he has in future should not be based on what he finds on pornhub - or wherever he is going?\n\nOpening a dialogue about sex and assuring him that he's normal is really what he needs. And you have a great tool to do it with. \n\nI'm sure your girlfriend is weirded out but potentially having this conversation together and potentially pushing the feelings of awkwardness from you both could be a reassuring and welcoming atmosphere instead of \"We know, you're a bad person!\"\n\nI'm sure you aren't that hostile and I'm making it a lot more than what it is. But you have to look at it also from his point of view.\n\nI used to stash Page-3 cutouts in my room. My Mother found them and boy I was in trouble. It was not a good lesson in sexual discourse and absolutely everything had to be kept from my parents after that incident. Teenage life was not easy from that angle.\n\nJust a thought and who knows, maybe I'm talking total crap.",

This story seems really familiar to me, as in, this has happened to me (a little differently of course) numerous times growing up. I didn\u2019t know why I did what I did back then and I am not making any assumptions about your child and their reasons behind what they did. But the way it was brought up to me hurt me for many years, I was scared to come out and come clean after that for more than a decade. Whatever you do, please just be kind. Try to understand and be available to talk, now or in the future. And whatever the motivation may have been, work through it with compassion, they\u2019ll thank you later. This is the method I take with my kids today anyway \u263a\ufe0f I hope things work out in a positive way for all of you! Have a great rest of your week, and I apologize if I overstepped.\n\nChlo\u00e9",

You sit them down and say \"I found some of <girlfriends name> dirty underwear in your room, taking stuff like that is unacceptable and offensive (watch your tone, be factual not preachy) and you have disappointed me and upset <girlfriend name>\"\n\nThat contextualises it into you know what he did. You are dissappointed which is far worse than angry and that girlfriend is upset which is worse than angry too.\n\nNext steps is to have the talk. If you haven't already it's clear that it's time to have one. If you have it's time to have another more Frank one.\n\nExplain that there must be boundaries and that <girlfriend name> might not trust them for a while and that <boy> needs to never do this or anything like this again.\n\nNext I would take every phone, laptop, computer they have access to and look through the history. Have they discovered some porn that's made them think this is normal?\n\nAsk them about that too and explain that porn is scripted like movies, it's not real, it's not realistic and that those scenarios never happen and it's not supposed to be for children.\n\nGood luck",

If you had a way of telling your partner about it (pretty casually, actually), then talking with your son should at least be possible. Of course it's not okay to smuggle dirty underwear, but he is a teen and your partner is not related to him. Sometimes, things just happen in young brain, and that's why it's important to talk it out with an adult. He needs to know it's not okay, but this situation is definitely hard for him too. Trust me, he needs a friend and a teammate now.\nIf your not going to talk about it with him, then who is going to?",

I took one pair that she'd worn, hid them in my room, but DIDN'T get caught and eventually snuck them back into the dirty clothes.  I was 12 years old I believe. It probably would have been good for me to have been taught about boundaries at the time, although I figured those out on my own later on.\n\nHowever I had a different but similar issue a year later where I had searched for some things on the family computer, didn't clear the search history, and my dad AND his girlfriend brought it up to me as soon as I got home from school one day - and I truly think that traumatized me a little bit because it was the first time anything sexual about me had been brought to the attention of others.  In that instance I wish they had just not said anything at all.  And considering I still remember that moment 16 years later with a bit of anxiety replaying it in my head, it probably was traumatic.\n\nSo... I guess it depends on how you think he'd react. Is he going to have a \"thank for you teaching me this valuable lesson dad\" response or a \"omg I can't believe this is happening, my life is ruined, I'm so embarrassed, etc etc\" anxiety reaction that might still freak him out 16 years later.

Unfortunately for me it developed into a compulsion as a whirlwind of depression and self hate got caught in with good time feelings, and soon the underwear became a mode for me to feel better. It eventually escalated for me, by the time I was an older teen I had a contact with law enforcement and was sitting in JuV for a B&E. Eventually things worked out once I started figuring the head stuff out for myself but there were a lot of challenges. \n\nWhen you talk with him, approach it please from a no judgements place. Know that he probably doesn\u2019t understand where his fascination comes from; this is a very common thing for guys anyways, the problem is when it starts getting to where he is taking them from other people. \n\nAlso, therapy is a good idea for anyone, it doesn\u2019t need to be for this specifically but everyone should have a good objective therapist if one can be afforded. \n\nI would recommend having a really good think about where you stand on pornography. I was exposed at an early age and it did me absolutely no favors whatsoever. It made things a lot harder, and it definitely contributed to an overall attitude of objectifying women and reducing them to just what they can do for me. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like his mom is around everyday, that\u2019s gonna be hard for any kid, and right now at 13 is a time when a mom can have a real impact on the way a young boy develops. I hope this incident doesn\u2019t freak your girlfriend out, though it\u2019s gonna be awkward for a bit. But I promise you, some good intervention now will save you all a lot of trouble, awkwardness, and time later on down the road. \n\nBest of luck my dude!",

As for your GF's relationship with your son.  Perhaps thats a situation where the less said the better.  I would make sure your son understands what just happened....however sitting down with your son and GF at the same time and talking about this might NEVER be a good idea.

You don't need to know what he did or understand him, HE just needs to understand that as a young man, he has a responsibility to respect women's boundaries despite any urges or compulsions. This is a teaching moment for consent that could easily turn to kink shaming if you don't leave your innate curiosity at the door. I'm a dad, rn my lil boy is a toddler. I can't imagine the crushing realization that your lil man is becoming a man, but respect shown and boundaries kept, will return ten fold. Consent consent consent. Respect women. Don't degrade them into things, etc. I wish you the best, and it's okay to mess up. My dad did, and I know his dad did, too. It's part of life.",

One day, she was fed up with me not cleaning my room (she has really bad clinical OCD). I got caught with her underwear under my bed in a shoebox.\n\nI found out when my dad picked me up from school and was unusually quiet that day; something felt off in the air. He told me his findings and then shamed me for it. He made me go to church as punishment and do Sunday school, but I straight up refused.\n\nI'm 30 now, long long history of trauma, finally turning over a new leaf and will be mending my relationship with my dad and step mom, now also two more siblings. Literally moving there in 6 days, crazy timing to see this post. Taking it as a sign that I'm making the right choice by moving there, it'll be my first time having a real relationship with my dad\n\n\n\ntl;dr I'd recommend to not shame your kid or it could fuck him up or lead him down a dark path, speaking from personal experience from the kid's perspective.\n\nUpdate: used my eyeballs to read the rest of the post lol\nI think you handled it well. You were firm but gentle, and still unconditionally loving about it. I say that in comparison to my own experience",

I'm glad you seem to understand that you need to have a talk with him but don't know how to go about it without it being awkward. The truth is, you're just going to have to let it be awkward. He's definitely of an age where this is fairly normal behavior, and this is relatively harmless right now, but it is time for a serious (probably awkward) and stern talk about respect, boundaries and consent. Stealing panties for your own pleasure from someone who isn't aware you're doing it is a huge boundary that shouldn't ever be crossed. It's okay if you make him feel a little awkward, it might do some good to help him realize what he did was not okay. This is a good time to talk about healthy masturbation habits, sexual health, proper use of condoms (teach him now so he knows for later), safe sex, and consent, consent, consent. Best of luck to you in raising a responsible, respectful gentleman! You can do it! And he'll thank you later for teaching him this now.",

Probably don't need to spell out the other stuff too much, keep the fantasies in his head, and try to be a gentleman. To cut against the grain telling your gf was a mistake, as much as she has a right to know some things in this world are better left unsaid, now that you did it I don't think a group powwow between them will work either, you just need to grit your teeth and hope time heals the wounds.",

Play golf together all the time.\n\nUnless you think he\u2019s some sort of sexual deviant leave it alone. You know, and trust me he knows you know and that feeling is probably more effective than anything you could possibly say to him. Tbh I think on the most fucked up thing here is that you told your gf. Total violation of bro code man\u2026",

Kids that age go through peoples phones to look for nudes of them. Kids that age can be creepy unfortunately. His actions were creepy. They crossed boundaries. No one said to shun or embarrass him. However, if he feels embarrassed talking about his actions, that\u2019s on him. No conversations would need to be had with the gf if the child did not take her underwear to use. He could have saved himself the embarrassment. But unfortunately he chose to do what he pleased with no regard to how that might make someone feel (to a woman that owes him absolutely nothing) and now everyone should pander to his feelings and deceive the gf about a violation of her boundaries? He should feel some level of shame for violating someone\u2019s boundaries and stealing from them. He should feel remorseful for taking someone\u2019s things and using them for something gross.",

I\u2019m not advocating tearing the kid apart. I\u2019m saying he should be confronted by OP and his GF where both explain that what he did was wrong and why. He should also have to apologize to the GF. This is a teachable moment where he needs to learn that sexuality comes with ethics, and that you don\u2019t get to do things to people or their belongings without their consent. He needs to learn that violating someone\u2019s boundaries means you have to face consequences.  \n\nThere are comments saying \u201che\u2019s just a kid it\u2019s better to not bring it up\u201d or \u201coh we all do creepy things when we\u2019re in puberty\u201d and that\u2019s just not healthy.",

You dont even necessarily know between right and wrong. You might steal your moms Macy's catalog and get excited from the nightwear section and rip a page out. You might get a little excited at the little mermaid. Shit, you might take your sister's underwear, stick a toothbrush up your ass, taste your creampie... whatever, man. You gotta figure things out. Completely natural. \n\nYou went into HIS room, uninvited (which is your right as a father) but you FOUND something and had the option to just throw them in the laundry and either a) ignore it or b) have a conversation, in private with your boy. Two completely normal reactions. What you decided to do, however, is embarrass your son, make your girlfriend feel weird, and make a fucking stupid joke. You managed to mess with both of them AND make yourself look like a jerk. \n\nI could see this being handled the way you did if it were his biological mother, as obviously incestual undertones need to be nixed asap. \n\nWhat's sad is you think you fucked up because you found them and not literally every decision you made after that hurt the people around you. \n\n\"At least we know he likes you\"\n\nDude you are a fucking douchebag.",

But it seems best for all parties involved that she not be told. What does that really accomplish. It will just make her mad and uncomfortable around your son. Possibly to the point that they can't live together anymore. Your son will be utterly humiliated. He will be anyway knowing you know but it will be 1000x worse if he knows she know. Again the result will only cause friction between them that might never go away. Obviously you don't want to have to end up choosing between living with you son or girlfriend. Too late now but you should have just talked to him. Maybe he was just using it to get his rocks off or maybe he's just trans or a crossdresser. Perhaps getting him his own set of panties would be enough to keep him out of her stuff. I don't envy the awkward conversation you need to have but I think you made a mistake going to her first.",

You just put him and your girlfriend in a very awkward situation that will never be forgotten.\n\nYou might as well start looking for a new girlfriend. This relationship is doomed and it's just a matter of time. That kid is not going anywhere for at least 5 years.\n\nIf you haven't tell him yet that you told her, you might still be able to save your relationship with him. You'll have to lie to hide the fact that you did him dirty in the first place. That's your penance. Having to live with the knowledge that you lied to him to protect him from your mistakes.\n\nIf you already told him, you managed to fuck up two relationships. Your girlfriend could say it's ok and seem like she gets over it, but most likely it will come up later and her relationship with your kid will be forever strained.\n\nSorry to be so negative, but I hope that, if something like that happens again to you, you put your kin over your girlfriend. This is the kind thing you don't have to tell her because the outcome can only be negative and ignorance is bliss. And if there's ever a time to lie to your partner, it's to protect your kids.",

An adult that\u2019s learned that their sexuality is something to be ashamed of is a dysfunctional one. 13 year olds are very sensitive to embarrassment which has huge impacts on their self-esteem. Handle the conversation in the wrong way and that damage to their self-esteem sticks. Knowing that his step-Mum is aware will destroy his ability to form a positive relationship with her. She is likely not the object of his sexual desires, if indeed it is for sexual purposes, she is just the only female he has access to that isn\u2019t family. He hasn\u2019t done anything wrong or unnatural, just inappropriate. Hell grown men pay good money for used underwear a 13 year old can\u2019t do that so they turn to what\u2019s available.

Are you fucking stupid or just a \"boys will be boys\" person. Dude. He needs to have a conversation with his son..doesn't have to be confrontational sure he can be tactful about it and teach him the importance of respecting personal property. And  how he needs to take other people's feelings in mind when you do certain actions. And the consequences of your actions. \nThis is on the boundary of alarming why would you want to wait till it got there? Think about how you would feel as the girlfriend.",

In the grand scheme of things this could work out fantastically in that the kid might avoid a more severe sexual violation in the future because of how OP handles this. If you expect to see people justifying and excusing the teenager's behaviour in this thread then you'll find it. There's a lot more nuance in most replies, though.

Come on, you cannot pretend that all offences are equal, there are more serious and less serious ones. Also, it's not like we are defending the behaviour: if an adult did it, that would be very serious, but a 13 years old boy may not have understood yet the boundaries and the appropriateness of certain actions. You're supposed to teach him, not to punish him, and I'm saying this not because he's male, but because he's 13, for god's sake!",

Thats crazy. Being a parent IS dealing with it, while teaching boundaries.\n\nBut you\u2019re placing the child\u2019s uncomfortability at having gotten caught stealing and jizzing in a woman\u2019s underwear and facing up to it, as something worse than the womans discomfort at having someone in the house who would take and use her things like that. \n\n\nShe has a right to know because it doesn\u2019t matter who the child is. You could say \u2018my uncle\u2019, \u2018friend\u2019, \u2018cousin\u2019, stole my partners panties. And it doesnt matter who the woman is because you could say my son stole \u2018my sisters\u2019, \u2018coworkers\u2019, \u2018friends\u2019 panties. \n\nThese actions are objectively wrong and need to be corrected but you can parent gently these days and i refuse to believe that the \u2018child\u2019 will fall apart because he was told not to spank it to his step mom. \n\nCould you tell me how comfortable you\u2019d feel if your son or your partner\u2019s son started stealing your things for his own \u2018purposes\u2019?

I did what one does when too horny to think and then didn\u2019t know what to do with the underwear so I hid it under the sink. One day I came home and it was just gone. Obviously someone found it (mom, sibling, housekeeper, who knows) but after a few days of fear about what would happen next, no one ever confronted me about it. 13 year olds are just horn mongers and don\u2019t know what to do with themselves. This could have more to do with the underwear than it does with your gf. Do yourself and him a favor and just never address it. Let it die and be buried in a long forgotten region of your collective psyche. Was the biggest relief of my life to never have to face that conversation and I like to think I turned out just fine without needing to have it.\n\n*Edit* - People, for gods sake, I was a child and I was sexually curious! I truly feel bad for your kids if you think a young boy being interested in women\u2019s underwear makes you \u201cdisturbed\u201d or a \u201cdegenerate\u201d. Watch any show that\u2019s honest about growing up as a boy (take Big Mouth for one) and you\u2019ll see that prepubescent kids are full of weird, sexual, and fucked up thoughts.

In any case, he's got extremely hard to control raging hormones and definitely didn't pick the right outlet to help handle that. He needs to know it's not acceptable but you also don't want him to be mortified to death for getting as close to a real vagina as he can without an actual woman. I highly doubt he was thinking clearly with a raging boner while making that decision. When I was a young teen, I'd snag a porno tape from my uncle's VCR and use that as a visual aid. I put the tape back in and put it right where it was scene-wise so he wouldn't know. Well, I tried to anyway. One time, His VCR ATE the fucking tape and I had to leave it the way it was. He offhandedly made a remark about somebody screwing around with a \"movie\" of his while my grandmother was in the room. I turned beet red and never even dreamed of doing that again. Another time, after he had moved, I found a porno mag he had left in a bathroom cabinet. I got distracted one day and left it somewhere right next to a Q-tip I had cleaned my ears out with. My mom goes to leave for work and tells me to go upstairs and to put that dirty Q-tip in the garbage and never leave anything like that laying around again. I thought to myself, WTF is she so pissed about a friggin Q-tip for? I went to do it and realized exactly what she meant. I was so ridiculously embarrassed. Another thing I never did again. My point being, from personal experience, a little embarrassment goes a long way. I'd go the lighter route before going thermonuclear on a 13-year-old. He will grow out of it as he learns to tackle his new urges and before you know it, he's going to be out there chasing the real thing and some panties will be the least of your problems.",

Yes, the obvious explanation is that he stole the panties for masturbation, but there are other possible explanations.  \n\nHe may be confused about his own sexuality and felt drawn to possessing something like that.  Maybe wearing them or even just having them.  In which case, he's now been outed to two people when he probably hasn't even got it figured out for himself yet.  \n\nYou (and most commenters) are entirely ignoring the possibility that your GF is sexually abusing your son. If genders were reversed and a woman posted here about finding her BF's boxers in her 13yo daughter's room, the comments would be screaming for that man's blood.  I realize it's a horrifying thought, but your GF should not have been told about this first.  \n\nJust my 2 cents, OP.  Good luck with the situation; I do not envy you!",

Let him know that its not ok to take other people's stuff without their knowledge and that the girlfriend is aware as well. Also inform him that about women having periods and different types of discharge while wearing underwear all through the year. Seriously, our bodies change on the daily and produce different stuff depending on our cycle, diet, the weather, our immune system, etc. Basically just make him turn away from used panties (especially your gf's). As long as you don't approach him with full on negativity and aggression. That would make him more keen on hiding stuff from you and to be emotionally distant. The awkward has just begun.

The dad here acted inappropriately by defaulting to protecting the girlfriend (who doesn\u2019t need protection) and not looking after his son appropriately. This is a teaching moment, not a shaming moment. Kids have so much baggage about sex, and if this kid is shamed and sided against, he\u2019ll carry that into adulthood.

Also very telling! I\u2019m glad your kids are decent people. I\u2019ve never once suggested shaming this kid. However a teaching moment comes with taking responsibilities for your actions, sometimes that\u2019s an embarrassing thing to do. Any feelings of embarrassment or awkwardness are entirely his fault. At 13, you know not to steal (and we know that he knew bc he hid them) even if you\u2019re horny.  Weird sex things are all fine and good, until you bring someone else or their things in to it. Some level of shame should be felt for stealing someone\u2019s things, that\u2019s what shame is for. It\u2019s literally what we feel when we do something wrong (and stealing someone\u2019s shit is something wrong). We do not protect kids from normal emotions, we do not shield kids that are old enough from normal consequences and subsequent conversations with the people they\u2019ve harmed. We do not help kids to avoid responsibility for their actions bc it will be \u201cembarrassing\u201d. The girlfriend had every single right to know. It was her things that were stolen after all. Any woman this happens to has a right to know. We do not pitter around the feelings of the person who messed up to make sure their mess up doesn\u2019t skew their sexual choices later. We tell them what they did was wrong and why, we have conversations even if they\u2019ll be embarrassed. If he chooses to be embarrassed and shamed so much over his own choice to steal that he Carries it in to adulthood, sounds like a him problem and he\u2019ll probably learn to stop whacking it to peoples shit. If the opposite happens and he just does it more, hopefully he\u2019ll fuck around with the wrong person and get some serious consequences. That\u2019s life, being young and horny doesn\u2019t keep it from affecting you.",

He\u2019s not weird, he\u2019s not in trouble, he\u2019s not bad, he\u2019s not unloved. We don\u2019t need to talk about specifics unless you want to! (Also sounds like this is about masturbation but he could wearing them and exploring confusing gender stuff. He could also be selling them for money to friends. Or who knows because being a teenager is HELLA WEIRD. \n\nAnd with growing freedoms and needs and abilities and urges also comes new responsibilities. This includes consent. And using other peoples private things without them knowing violates their consent. From now on, girlfriends\u2019s personal items are private. Deal? \n\nStep 2: make sure you have a plan for your kid to get shame free sex education - depending on what state you\u2019re in this may not be possible at school. There\u2019s a cool program called OWL (our whole lives) through the UU church and Planned Parenthood also has great resources. And there are lots and lots of great, educational, kind books about sex you can buy or get at the library. Helping him learn about feelings and communication and how to deal with shame and jealousy are going to be as important as understanding biology and safety practices. \n\nThis is a super important moment for you to model some wholesome masculinity and show him how to have a weird hard conversation, not lose any love or connection with you, and grow in his integrity and empathy.\n\nAnd, your girlfriend also gets to have some support for making sure she feels good and cared for too. If it gets weirder or harder this is a HELLA good time for a family therapist. \n\nGood luck to all of you!!",

He just needs a little nudge to do better job managing his totally normal impulses. \n\nAnd I don\u2019t know if it would help your girlfriend\u2026 I\u2019m a step to a boy of roughly the same age. It helps to remember that she\u2019s his best source for those things, that sort of knowledge, his previous source being his own mother. My stepson left me in a couple awkward situations, too. She\u2019s not alone in this. It\u2019s really difficult to be a woman in this position. I don\u2019t know what it feels like to be the son in this scenario, but I hope you can let her know it\u2019s part of his growing up process. The other awkward piece for YOU, is then to teach him how to respect women. Which includes refraining from stealing underwear.",

The only thing I'd like to add is that I myself had a vaguely similar if you squint your eyes at it scenario as your son, and it was part of what led me down a path to discover that I'm actually trans. Now, bringing up a question of \"Are you trans?\" in this conversation would likely make it more awkward, maybe he's just using them for what everyone in the thread thinks he is, but the way I would do it is know beforehand about any kind of sex-and-gender-based service in your area (hopefully free lol) that he could take himself to and suggest that he goes and talks to someone there if he needs to. Don't try and overstate the point about it, just try and slip in \"If you're unsure about something, maybe try and go talk to someone here\"",

He is 13. Yes, 13 year olds are capable of heinous acts. This was a serious violation of her privacy and of your relationship with your gf. He should be regretful and embarrassed. He needs to rebuild your trust in him and trust he won't do things like this to anyone. But he needn't form horrible feelings about his sexuality. Id bet a vast vast majority of 13 year olds wished they'd never have \"inappropriate\" thoughts about people like teachers, friends, acquaintances, etc. The point is to create a dialogue and help make sure he avoids acting on it. Its all learning when a kid is still growing up. If it happens again, tell the gf unless you think she is in danger, and then in that case you could get professional help for him and get her out of there. I would've consulted someone before possibly irreversibly damaging the relationship between son and gf and held off until after talking to the son.",

It wasn\u2019t for sexual gratification, he would wear them to feel comfort among other things. Even as an adult wears women\u2019s intimates (now buys himself not stealing).  This may not be applicable to your son as perhaps there was evidence of sexual use of the underwear. \n\nHave an open conversation with your son without shaming him just with curiosity and also teaching how it impacted your girlfriend and how consent is important. It you need help, find a sex therapist to talk to about it to get some guidance on how to have the conversation.",

And, besides it being awkward, do you really know, what it is what is wrong about it? When I read your post I went through several stages of thought. One thing was, well, he seems to be a perfectly normal 13 year old heterosexual boy. Another thing I was thinking about was, is it wrong, and if yes, why? So I went on to thinking about why it is wrong, and what kind of feelings where caused by his deed ... how it makes you feel, and how it makes your girlfriend feel. I am 38f, so I was thinking about how it would be for me, if my underwear was taken and used for... I mean it is ... well, if my SO would be asking me for my underwear to do ... with it, I probably would consent to it, but if he did it without asking... it would feel a little weird, still, I probably would be OK with it, with my SO. But besides him, worn underwear is s.th. really private. It feels like an intrusion, somebody is doing s.th. sexual with me (my underwear/ body scent) I did not agree to. ... I think, it would probably be really hard for both of them, if your girlfriend would be joining this conversation, but if she told him how she is feeling about it and would explain it to him, I guess, that would be a really important lesson for him to learn. Also it would show him how his actions affect others, emotionally and I think that's a great thing to learn. You don't have to talk about what he did with the underwear, I guess it is enough to say, doing s.th. sexual or privat with a very privat belonging of somebody else. Maybe even ... if the son feels way to uncomfortable, make it more of a general talk and not explicitly about those two panties in his closet. Definitely make him feel loved and show him that you want to understand him too and that he is not a creep for doing that, just show him the emotional consequences of his actions, good luck!",

He does NOT have to see her in a sexual way to do this. People can like masturbating to women's panties, and it's the underwear, not the particular woman who wears them, that's the appeal. Or he could've been curious or cross dressing, as others pointed out.\nIt's also possible, though unlikely since she probably knows you do his laundry so wouldn't leave them there, that she already knew they were in there and is just pretending she didn't know.\n\nBut regardless of all that, I honestly just don't understand why people think this is so disgusting or weird or horrible. Like, people pay money to get used women's panties all the time. This isn't the same thing because he stole them, but the act of masturbating to underwear is not at all weird.\n\nAlso, not that this is one, but there's nothing wrong with fetishes as long as healthy boundaries for oneself and others is maintained, and kink shaming isn't okay. And yeah, he probably did violate her boundaries. But he also probably didn't know better. \n\nPlus, teenagers are at the stage of brain development where the emotional part of the brain develops before the logical/reasoning part of the brain. This is largely what often makes teenagers impulsive. They don't have that system built up yet that as adults we'd go \"well let's just think about this for a second.\" They are motivated by emotional and hormonal thinking. So he probably just saw them, felt a spur of horniness, and took them without considering the consequences.\n\nAnd to be clear, I'm a woman. If I found out some teenager had stolen my underwear, I'd be like, ok, not cool that you stole them, but whatever?\n\nIt's not like my underwear are tied to my identity or body, they wouldn't have violated me beyond the theft of my property. I might feel a little weird about it, or maybe disappointed if I liked that pair because I wouldn't wear them again, but I just don't see it as a big deal if they stole the underwear because it was available to them. And if I wanted them to not use my underwear anymore I might just buy them a new pair.\n\nEveryone has different ways of doing things and some people feel aroused when they see underwear. So what?",

He knew those panties were there and when he got home they weren't there anymore so right now he is scared as fuck so most likely he will not do it again since he thinks you know.\n\nAnd even if he does continue I would assume he throws them in the laundry so when she gets them again they are clean. So no harm done. Really weird though but bringing it up could ruin any possibility for your GF and your son to ever have a good relationship. It could scar a 13yo.\n\nEdit. If you need to bring it up I think it would be better if she brought it up alone with him. And saying she is flattered by his feelings of attraction towards her but that his behavior isn't okay. That will be really embarrassing but he will probably get over it. But as long as she can show she isn't pissed or disgusted by him I think it will blow over.",

This is a \" Oh shit that's not ok\" moment that needs nipped in the bud now before he escalated the behavior to peeping or something. You need to approach in an understanding but firm way so he doesn't feel attacked, but gets the point that what he did was serious and won't be tolerated. Don't tell at him, but explain boundaries and consent and how you understand he's going through a lot of changes and has urges, but he can't violate others to get what he wants. \nIf you don't take this serious and correct him now we'll number one you're probably going to lose your girlfriend because that's creepy as hell and a serious violation to her and number two he will escalate and start targeting others and pushing boundaries on others because he thinks it's ok and he can get away with it, because he has so far. \n\nAlso why are you washing a 13yr old's clothes? That's babying him and setting him up for failure when he doesn't know or want to do things for himself. My boys have been doing their laundry themselves since they were 8 and now my oldest is almost 15 and learning to cook and does dishes on top of cleaning up his stuff. At 13, he should be solely responsible for cleaning up his space and his things. \n\nI'm not trying to be mean or tear you down. I'm just pointing out that maybe you should be reinforcing a teenager's independence by teaching them life skills like laundry and making them responsible for it.",

That instilled a broken weird thought process for me.  These things continued through my mid to late teens. I was a \u201csexual deviant\u201d I suppose, among other things.  I never hurt or touched anyone, but I would be sneaky and masturbation habits were not exactly normal.   Be upfront to him quickly, but be kind.  My folks eventually learned how to talk to me, and I learned how to act and communicate.   I\u2019m 35 now, and relatively happy/normal.

If you feel the behavior was so perverse that you have to confront your kid about it, at least let him know you didn't tell her about it...let him know you're not running around exposing his kinky behavior.\n\nThere are so many other ways to handle this.

So he'd almost think it's okay to do if he never sat down with him about it. Heck i think getting him Sex Counseling would be a good idea. Just for a month or two to work out why he did it and that it's wrong. Cause inevitably most 13-18 year old boys do stupid stuff like this. Ik at 14 i did some dumb stuff and i still do lol. So smacking him back into line with a little pep talk so he doesn't normalize... stealing girls underwear. It's good on the Father and i Hope you and your kid can work through this.",

She wasn't victimized by him, but now she's going to always feel like she was, and he's always going to feel awkward around her; and no doubt she's going to share that story with others. You could have gone to him directly and tried to be understanding about it but firm that it was inappropriate, and then promised to keep this episode of teenage awkwardness between the two of you. Going to the girlfriend first betrays that connection and leaves him on the outside, and he's always going to feel that. \n\nAt this point the best you can do is try to find a way you and your girlfriend can deflate the tension and make it something you can all have an awkward laugh about and find a way to move past it. Otherwise you've permanently marked your 13-yo kid as the family perv, and it's going to fuck him up. He's a kid!",

It says a lot about your own maturity if you are scared about the confrontation of an awkward topic on the kid's behalf. I can't even begin to understand how you question OP's parerenting when you obviously don't have any decent experience yourself. Yes, it would be cool if the girlfriend didn't say anything to her friends and kept it as a family-only issue, but that is ultimately her own discretion. \n\nHow can you care so much about the son's privacy, but so little for hers? And by you telling OP that he should've just wrapped them back in the towel and left it there, you're telling him to not only be complacent, but complicit too.",

It's the closest he's likely got to a non family members vagina and he's curious and more horny than sensible. I wouldn't say scold or shame but a gentle conversation about sex can go a long way. He's likely got questions and you may have answers. If not be willing to help him find healthy pathways for his urges. Through education and understanding you'll get through it.

Excessive (some say any) porn use can screw up kids that age by warping their ideas of how relationships work and the availability of sex from willing partners.  That's the fantasy.\n\nIf he continues watching it, it will destroy your relationship.  Shoot down any idea of sharing her or second chances if he doesn't get help.\n\nTry really hard not to get mad at him and discuss rationally and offer amnesty if he is willing to work with you.  Not a free pass but a negotiated agreement including apologies between all parties.\n\nAlso give her underwear special handling in the future so he can't easily obtain it.\n\nIf you haven't talked about sex and relationships, it is long overdue.  Talk to him about safe sex and encourage him to get his own girlfriend.  \n\nThen you can put it in the past.  Everyone has some past thing they cringe about.  Help him through it.",

You then need to explain boundaries and why this particular behavior is inappropriate.

This needs to be addressed.\n\nJoking and taking a \"boys will be boys\" stance will not be helpful to your son. Being too embarrassed to discuss his behavior will not be helpful to your son.\n\nI would highly recommend that you take your son to a mental health professional who has experience in working with sexual acting out issues with teens. I'm a mental health professional and worked with this population of kids and teens for over a decade. In my experience, boys who steal women's underwear to masturbate almost always have significant anger problems. At the very least, he needs to understand that his behavior was very wrong and he needs to make a full apology (meaning \"with full understanding of his behavior\"; which -- respectfully-- neither you nor he seem to have at the moment).\n\nI would also highly recommend that you seek therapy yourself. (This isn't a bad thing - I've been in therapy myself. Multiple times.)  Any parent who says, \"The worst part is, I don\u2019t know how to bring it up to him!\" or thinks that he f\\*cked up because he cleaned his son's room can use the support of a therapist.\n\nAm I making a mountain out of molehill? Ask u/Pumpkinpunz. These types of behaviors can lead to criminal charges (not to say ruined lives) down the road. Many of the teens that I worked with had been legally charged with sex-related crimes.\n\nIf I am wrong, then you and your son get some counseling sessions. You both learn some new skills ... and you go on your merry way and live good lives.\n\nBut if I am right ... by getting your son help now, you are saving he and you from a life of unnecessary pain.\n\nI hope you take this problem seriously.\n\nGood luck!",

You do need to have a talk with him to make clear that this was inappropriate and must not happen again but let him know that ultimately it's not as big of a deal as I'm sure he's made it out to be. You could maybe share an embarrassing moment from your teenage past and let him know that he can talk to you about his normal urges and where the boundaries lay.",
