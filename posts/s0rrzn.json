You just reply 20 times, ignoring every argument I made and just preach your feminist words. I stopped answering cause the debate was going anywhere, you\u2019re 100% sure of your opinion and you\u2019re not really here to try convience or debating. You\u2019re just here to say no no and no. This is why I stopped answering not because you made super argument lol \n\n>Sorry the way I talk triggers you, my g.\n\nClassic. Copy past what I just said about you, then insert \u00ab\u00a0my g.\u00a0\u00bb which seems in your mind to mean \u00ab\u00a0I win\u00a0\u00bb \ud83d\ude02",
