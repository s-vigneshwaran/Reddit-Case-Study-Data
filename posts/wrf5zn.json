I lost interest and then could never really get back into it. 10 years later Some of the shit I was buying in stores and keeping carded is worth 10x+ what I was paying for it.

                      "text": "Pro-tip #1: buy two pair of \"daily wear\" shoes and wear them on alternating days. Constant humidity is the #1 premature killer of shoe uppers and linings. Let them dry out for 24 hours before rewearing. In the case of work boots (which are probably thick enough to hold up to daily wear), you'll instead enjoy healthier feet that get to at least start the work day inside of a dry boot.  \n\nPro-tip #2: when possible, buy shoes that have uppers that are stitched (and not glued/vulcanized) to the sole. Goodyear welted construction is a great option for boots and dress shoes, but it's not an option for a sneaker that looks like a sneaker. You can buy classic style sneakers that are stiched to the sole. Expect to pay about twice as much as you'd drop on the discount pair of vans/converse/toms. If your shoes regularly fail between the upper and sole, it's worth it.  \n\nPro-tip #3: if you have a desk job, make your daily wear shoes a couple pairs of resole-able boots or dress shoes. Once they are broken in, they're almost as comfortable as sneakers, and you have now extended the life of your shoes from a few years to potentially a few decades. If you are on your feet all day (medical/shipping/industry) and need sneakers or safety boots, ignore pro-tip #3. You need something that is a) highly functional (non-slip, safety toe, shock resistant, etc.) and b) highly comfortable/supportive, and there are no options that are also c) exceptionally durable. You can't have all three, stick to a) & b), but buy a 2nd pair.",

It could be your foot needs a size 10 but your arches need a size 11. Maybe not that extreme but you get the idea. A size 10 shoe fits but your arches won't be happy about it.\n\nInsoles: 3/4 times it's better to swap for an aftermarket insole, as even within the same brand their insoles vary a lot. Just make sure whatever you get properly supports your arches inside the shoe.\n\nGet a boot dryer, and place them on every time you wear them. Shoes get damp as you wear them, and more strenuous activities mean more sweat and a wetter shoe. When you put the shoe away wet, bacterial and fungal growth explode, and your shoe will not only start to smell worse than normal, it'll start breaking down the inside of the shoe. If the idea makes you uncomfortable, it should. You can prevent it though. By drying it out every time.\n\nDon't overtighten your laces, as that can actually bruise the top of your foot and contribute to a collapsed arch (which is why support is important). Trust me, you don't want that.\n\nReplace the shoes every 6 months, swapping the insoles every 1-3 months depending on how much you're on your feet every day.\n\nIf you buy two pair and swap them out every other day, you could probably get a year and a half out of the lot, maybe two years if you don't stress them to much day to day.\n\nSorry for the rant",

Walking probably doesn't cause as much stress and damage I'd guess.  When I switch out a pair of running shoes I keep the old pair for more 'casual' activities, but I inevitably burn through the entire tread or the shoe rips at the sole.\n\nStill, the difference in comfort when switching is amazing.  Gets expensive though.\n\nI do have work/stylish shoes up to 10 years old.",

Typically the dealer is not suppose to let your just order the F8 unless you have a pre-existing relationship with Ferrari whether you owned a used one or you own an entry level one.

If you want a specific product or the flagship product they often want you to be a pre-existing customer first. It's like you can buy a Submariner anywhere, but if you want to order one from Rolex directly, typically they won't sell you one unless you have a pre-existing relationship with the brand.

You will not be treated well at a Ferrari dealership if you are not already a Ferrari customer most likely, and because of limited production runs everyone who can afford a Ferrari cannot purchase a Ferrari so they get to be choosy about who gets to buy their products. There's a Jay Leno video that talks about their practices. Also there was that cease and desist that Ferrari sent to ~~Diplo~~deadmau5 for wrapping his 458 with a nyancat pattern\n\nThis is something you see in luxury brands a lot. You're often invited to buy a birkin bag from an Hermes boutique only if you are already a notable VIP, and they will also try to sell you on the less desirable ones before they show you the good stuff. Patek Phillipe Nautilus, Audemar Piguet Royal Oak, and basically every Rolex model put people on multiple year long waiting lists, and many jewelers are shady and will put you higher in the Rolex allocation depending on how many other watches you get there. Even sneaker drops, while generally more accessible, have raffles to give you the privilege to *purchase* shoes.",

If that's what you're doing, then you're as successful as it gets. You should always set goals and be trying to work on yourself, but you should also know how to be content with what you have so you aren't stressing and burning yourself out over things you will never have access to. \n\nYou're doing fine. Most people are doing fine. The problem is the world has an obsession with privileged idiots who imply you need a yacht to be cool, and thus that is what they think should make them happy. Meanwhile I think most normal, down-to-earth and well-adjusted people would just be happy living in a comfortable home without having to worry about living paycheck to paycheck. But we make do with what we have.",

But, all i know is that to purchase 488 pista you probably going to need more than money.

So their overall investments grow, and they just pay off the line of credit.\n\nIt\u2019s early so I\u2019ve glossed over details but that\u2019s the gist.",

I fulfill so many conditions, that I could stop having home insurance and whatever else, and I would still get the 1% discount.\n\nDiscounts are calculated yearly. Worst case scenario, if I completely abandon my bank and I stop using the card / stop getting my salary in my account / whatever, next year it would be 1.75% fixed rate for that year. If I keep doing what I've been doing for the last 10+ years, though, it will remain 0.75% fixed rate, because of the 1% \"discount\".\n\nSorry for the lack of semantic precision; I have never negotiated a mortgage in English.",

Selling assets, such as equity or securities, is taxed -- the capital gains portion is. Therefore, you take out a loan against your assets, spend a portion to fund your lifestyle then invest the rest of the loan. The interest rate on the loan is typically very low, and the lifestyle spending is very little relative to the investment, so as long as the return on the invested portion matches or exceeds the cost of interest plus lifestyle, the borrower ends up with a lifestyle income that's not taxed.",
