      "text": "I\u2019ve talked to a lot of woman and military members about this topic because it\u2019s very sensitive but very simple. Females have been proven to be unable to function in high pressure situations, like being shot at and fighting for their very lives as Males. There has been a plethora of Tests done by multiple organisations including most military\u2019s into the stress response in both sexes. \n\nThere is also strength which is a large issue. The avg kit carried by modern soldiers is bloody heavy, the avg kit will have Ammo, Medical, MRE\u2019s and a plethora of other items along with the Heavy body armour and the 7 pound gun they\u2019re carrying around at all times.  Males on average are naturally stronger than females meaning the avg Female is gona have a hard time with a standard load out being between 60-100 pounds depending on their loadout and position .  It\u2019s Biology, this is why Females are better suited to support rolls where there is less stress and no 80 pound kit on their back allowing them to function better and use their skills. It\u2019s not sexism or discrimination it\u2019s biology, both sexes where designed for different roll\u2019s.",

I know all of this because my sister has gone down the feminist rabbit hole and when we used to have military personal over or be at events with them my sister would usually ask gender roll and woman in the military type questions which actually gave my a decent amount of Answers for these types of situations. \n\nBut in western military\u2019s eg, US, US, CA, AUS, NZ ect if a member of the armed forces even attempts such an act they will be immediately dishonerly  discharge escorted out by the MP to the authorities for charges to be pressed.  I have no idea about how non western countries would handle this situation but I\u2019m guessing in places like China, Russia, turkey or most non western countries from what I have reached on this topic are not open about how they deal with Rape inside their military most likely protruding to them not being a safe place for woman.\n\nThere where a few Rape scandals in the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s but due to there bearly any woman in the military at that time they where mostly Man on Man. \n\nAs stated in my first comment there are a multiple of reasons the military is not suited to most woman, stress reaction, physical and biological barriers and more.  I\u2019ve talked to one woman who dropped out of basic training after about a week and I talked about it with her at a function a few years back and after she ranted on about how bad basic was and how it treated her she said that from what she saw in basic was the the military had one good thing and that was equality, they treated everyone like Shit no matter who you where, if you where a man, woman, other or even the son of a high rank you where all treated like shit and she said that was why she dropped out.  \n\nThe military does all that crap to prepare you for situations where emotions and feelings need to go out the window so you can actually stay alive and the negative techniques they use to prepare you for deadly situations is just not an appeal for most woman.",

Where there is war women get raped, bc the men are under heavy stress and pressure. We know that is true, that is just a fact we can\u2019t get around studies have been done it. There have been Women in military on the front line getting captured and then raped by the opposing side, to then be \u201cthrown back\u201d bc it creates chaos. It is a \u201cstrategy\u201d that has been used since the dawn of mankind to provoke and as revenge. You kidnap the opposing sides women and rape them, it is a form of \u201cpsychological torture\u201d in a sense bc kidnapping and raping the other sides women effectively gets to the men. It makes the men more impulsive in their decision making and they will wanna seek revenge. It is psychology. \n\n\nAlso having a 0 tolerance about rape doesn\u2019t stop it from happening? You need to read my comment properly here. There is absolutely a higher risk getting raped as a woman in the military. I didn\u2019t say the military doesn\u2019t give a shit about it or had a feminist agenda. Or that women get treated more like shit that the men. But honestly I think it is hard to deny that women take a higher risk. \n\nI was pointing towards that I can def see how if a woman gets raped in military, she could possibly jeopardise everything by talking loudly about what happend while they are in active \u201cduty\u201d so to speak. It doesn\u2019t matter after the fact, but I could def see how they would want her not talking about it to the other men in the group about it and keep it \u201cunder the radar\u201d to not stir anything up.\n\nMy boyfriend did military training in Israel and he said if a woman ends up getting raped she can\u2019t talk about it while being on a mission. It will be dealt with, I didn\u2019t say it isn\u2019t dealt with. But her talking about it mid mission IS a risk for everyone in the group, bc it stresses out the men who are already in a stressful situation. So they become more likely to get less focused on the goal and become more impulsive. It creates chaos within the circle bc men ultimately wanna protect the women around them, especially if they are working in military they probably have a very close bond.",

I think another aspect is that poverty is a big incentive for people to join the military and women are more able and more likely to explore certain alternatives.\n\nBoth men and women could take out student loans to fund their higher education journey. However women are more likely to do that than men.\n\nAlso a poor woman could be a stripper, waitress or bartender and profit off her looks and sexuality to escape poverty. A man could do the same as well but the threshold is higher for men than women. A woman would mostly just need to be young and in shape while a man would need to be young, in shape and attractive to get similar results.",

I was trying to get recruited for the airforce when I was 20, I was already really fit, I used to do a lot of outdoor activities, material arts and cycling. Plus I took my health very seriously throughout my teens. I did better than all the women in the fitness tests and was up there with some of the men, but those men weren't that fit (like really unfit) and the other men that were just as fit as I was, they still out did me and were far more physically stronger. No matter how hard I train, I will never be as strong as the other fit men. \n\nI decided to opt out, because I started having doubts about myself and I don't think have the mentality like the rest of them, even though the female recruiter reckons I would've made a good FP or MP just because of my fitness, but I really highly doubt it and I'm a really sensitive person, lol. I felt stupid for trying in the first place.\n\nWhat bothers me, which I didn't realize at the time for the fitness/physical test... they only require 7 push ups for the women and the rest of the tests were also very minimum for a woman. One of the ladies there was overweight, she didn't even do 7 push ups, but still passed. Wtf. She was recruiting for a logistics operator, but I thought you had to have the required fitness for all trades in the airforce? Beats me. \n\nAnyway, this is the NZ airforce and to be fair, there's a lot of women that dominate the logistics operator side and it's extremely toxic. I can't remember meeting a single male Sgt. Majority of them were women. My ex partner and 4 other men were bullied by the women in that workplace, 2 of them tried to commit suicide, that's including my ex partner... I still get nightmares about it.",

Emotional sensitivity is needed depending on the engagement we\u2019re in.",

He was very shut off, even after the attempt to end himself, he would not explain anything to me whenever I asked \"is there anything else that happened?\" I could tell he was hiding something. My ex partner was 6ft 3 tall and very handsome, he's also never been the type to let women push him around and he was an anti feminist. I keep fearing he was sexually harassed or something and too embarrassed/worried to tell me \ud83d\ude22 I couldn't help him which caused the break up. I know it was years ago, but it stings so much. Sorry for the rant, I know I need to get these feelings sorted out.\n\nAw thanks, I hope you're right, I do feel like I somewhat missed out on something and I still have a 2nd chance to be recruited. I just need to sort myself out first. I'll make sure to look into it more for next time and hopefully find a trade that's more beneficial. Thank you for your reply.",

Then they help you identify what areas of life you are specifically confident and so on. Confidence is just an example\n\nBut then everyone would be focused on what they can do vs what they cannot. If someone is diagnosed they learn everything about it. I wonder how much of this is known already and put to use. Perhaps these extreme groups are attempting to cultivate something far from their advertised goals. \n\nSo there are multiple layers. The people in protected groups are allowed these heightened rights simply for an alteration into vulnerability of perspectives. \n\nI traced the trends I could remember starting from when participation awards began and it seems like breeding a generation of narcissism is the goal.

Some are closer to the same dimension as you and others are far distant. \n\nThen a whole flood of new ideas came to me lol \n\nI like \u201centity\u201d I\u2019ve always referred to it as \u201cthe collective mind\u201d \n\nI use to work at a telemarketing place that accidentally showcased an interesting interaction \n\nIt was robocalls, pre recorded but we would control the calls with a keyboard. 2-4 calls at a time per person.\n\nMe and some friends noticed that all the calls would be screaming people and suddenly hella buyers that were chill. The lead source was not updated either\n\nSo it made me wonder if there were a link of sorts. Somehow the nation would switch moods together and over the process of an hour\n\nI then came across a study that says emotion changes the molecular structure of water. So the \u201cbad vibes\u201d is now scientifically measured. We are 70% water. \n\nIt could be that people are very receptive and in abundance. This was 10 years ago when things were chill. There\u2019s clearly something going on that is difficult to explain beyond the internet trash, but it may be directly related. \n\nMass bad news would cause a mass of one emotion and could spread like a wave",

Gotta breed the mindset that will back the desired change in a landslide approach \n\nRetracing the slipperyslope of it all, chaos theory etc. it honestly seems biblically motivated. \n\nIt\u2019s just another layer to overthrow traditional western governments. This would be the puppets goal but the source of inspiration for this idea and the underlying result it is causing seems to be riddled with evil intent. A massive misdirection \n\nThe funny thing about technology development is the limiting factors lol if there were not influences of power we would be far more advanced than we are. Patents are FAR more expensive than they use to be as well\n\nSo I don\u2019t believe technological advancements are a focus, except for limiting them. Just as your idea with the algorithm applies, so does what people do in their day to day life\n\nThe numbing aspect of social media has amazing benefits for someone wanting lemmings so why not bring in virtual reality and augmented reality? But then notice how oculus was purchased by FB. Immersed social media would have a greater impact\n\nMechanical components in our bodies would be unnecessary really. When there is already a predictable human nature, just careful planning drawn from data mining is all that is required\n\nPain or pleasure is how the mind and world works. Some people will go to amazing lengths to achieve pleasure and avoid pain. Even hinder themselves. If you can alter the meanings of pain and pleasure then you just need to sit back and wait\n\nAlso with documentation of thoughts. I just have rabbit holes of folders within folders that lead to condensed notes that will remind me of the concept if I forget\n\nI made detailed recordings and notes for a while but I noticed how much of a waste of time that was as time progressed. I\u2019d look back and notice a flawed thought because I was on a different platform now. Probably the re-engineering you speak of\n\nTry condensed notes. Most of my ideas just stay in my Memory Palace. If you don\u2019t know what that is, check it out. You can go beyond storing memories in drawers etc but can store memories in emotions if you like. I spent some time storing memories in other memories lol",

Then they rape them and \u201cthrow them back\u201d, bc they know it will create chaos to the group. The men go into full blown revenge mode if a woman in a pluton gets raped, which is why she is told not to say anything about it.\n\nEverywhere there is war women and children get raped all over the place.  \n\nLike shit is brutal in war.
