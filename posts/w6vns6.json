  "text": "TIFU by laughing at a woman's unfortunate demise in a full auditorium. [NSFW]\nThis happened a few years ago, it was my first week of university studying law. I met a young guy a few years younger than me let's call him Dave, in my class who I spent most of the first week with.\n\nIt was our first ever criminology class and it was a new lecturer a woman in her mid 20s and the lesson was in a auditorium of nearly 100 people. She began by explaining the difference between manslaughter and murder and begin to tell us of a real case example.\n\nThe lecturer who ended up quite red in the face explained about a couple engaging in some form of roleplay and eventually ended with him fisting his partner. A signet ring he was wearing caught inside her and she unfortunately ended up bleeding to death.\n\nNow comes the fuck up, obviously after this story there was a very awkward silence. Dave thought this break in noise was the perfect time to ask me a pertaining question in his innocence. 'I get why that would be considered manslaughter but why does she keep saying fisting instead of punching?'\n\nThe question was so hilariously innocent at the worst ever time. I'm now sitting cry-laughing unbelievably loudly after this absolute horrible story. It was 100 times funnier like a joke at a funeral because I knew how surreal it must be for everyone else in attendance of me laughing so hard I can barely breathe.\n\nTL;DR: Woman that died from being fisted caused me to cry-laugh in front of 100 people because my friend thought that fisting was synonymous with punching and asked a question about it at the worst possible time.",

Maybe it was like STD World Awareness Day or something.  \n\nAnyway, she kept mentioning \"water sports.\"  My friend and I were baffled at how you could be at any risk of contracting an STD by water skiing or river rafting.  I wonder if *anyone* at this smallish Christian college had the faintest idea of what she was actually talking about.",

Most of our play was in the shower, but I have these 4'x4' pads that are laid out and layered if it's going to be in bed.  They contain the mess and just have to be washed and air dried.    \n\n\nDrinking directly from the tap is amazing in its own right and I think the peak of intimacy as far as the act is concerned.  \n\n\nIt's since spread to others who have agreed to try it with me.  Once you make someone squirt, the inhibitions to it tend to melt away and they're a lot more willing to try.",

              "text": "I had a freshman level class that was an odd but interesting combination of literature and ancient history. The professor was this little old man with a wavering voice who liked to give us an antedeluvian vocabulary word at the start of class, before launching into the lecture. I say lecture but the joke was calling the class \"story time with grandpa\". So with this in mind...\n\nWhen we're talking about the ancient Greeks, he's covering the Illiad etc, in fairly broad strokes and is mentioning how many women, goddesses, mythical creatures, and everything in between that these protagonists are having sex with. Girl raises her hand, super innocent homeschooled-her-whole-life (she was in another class of mine), and asks how they're having all this sex and little to no babies. Professor makes a sly joke about a backdoor solution. It flies a MILLION miles over her head, so she doubles down on her question. So this sweet little raisin of an old man has to explain to her that people even back then would have sex in the asshole as a method of contraception. Well judging by the look on her face, she didn't know that was a thing ever, now or then, and she was *ABSOLUTELY HORRIFIED*, much to the chagrin of the rest of the class.",

              "text": "Can confirm. I did deliveries for a flower shop in my youth. The guys at the funeral home, whether morticians or the other workers, always had the darkest humor. I'll share a story:\n\nMy mother and father bought this flower+gift shop when I was in elementary school and ran it basically by themselves with occasional part time help (and me of course). At some point very early on, my mother was delivering a load of flowers to the main funeral home in town and we got more than we bargained for. We had delivered there many times by this point and we had gotten to know a lot of the workers, some of which my parents already knew before they got into the business because it was a small town. There was really just one other prominent flower shop in town and it turns out that the funeral home workers absolutely hated the owner of the other one for various reasons. My mother loved to bake and sell her goods at our shop, so she got into the habit of bringing some to the funeral home workers from time to time. It was a quid pro quo thing because the workers would steer grieving families to our shop for their flower needs.\n\nAnyway..\n\nThere was a specific door for flower deliveries in the back of the building. We almost always set the flowers inside the door in a designated area and the workers would do the rest. But this day would be slightly different. The grieving family in question insisted on an elaborate corsage to go on the body's chest. We're talking 80's high school homecoming size and used only fresh flowers (sometimes silk is used for those). The family was very specific. My mother explained to them that the problem is that a giant fresh corsage is designed to last only a few hours for a school dance and otherwise needs to be refrigerated to last any longer than that. Not to go too deeply into the fresh cut flower science, but just understand that flowers can last a while after being cut if they have plenty of stem under them to continue providing nutrients temporarily. A corsage involves cutting basically the whole stem off, so the flower will start dying more or less immediately. In this case, the body would be laying in state for family visitation the next evening and then the funeral plus a graveside service would be the next day. The only way for this to work would be to put the corsage on the body for a couple of hours that night for visitation and then take it off to body to be refrigerated and then put back the next day for the funeral. My mother called the funeral home to ask if this was feasible and they confirmed that it would be fine. These people were paying a LOT of money for the finest flower arrangements, so she wanted it to be perfect for them.\n\nFast forward to the night of visitation and my mother had purposely waited until the last possible minute to make the corsage and bring it to the funeral home right before the visitation so that it would have the best chance of surviving through tomorrow and still look decent. We arrive to find that the funeral home workers had largely gone home as it was around 5:30pm or so. The only ones left were elderly / semi-retired people that hang around to guide the families and visitors to the in-state room and keep the coffee pot filled all night and the tissues stocked. While I was unloading the bulk of the flowers, my mother headed inside to deal with the corsage. She asks for the mortician that she talked to earlier, but he was gone. I noticed the body laying in the coffin in the small hallway behind the in-state room waiting to be rolled in. I had seen this before and it didn't bother me at this point. I knew that because it was late, I had to get the flowers into the room instead of letting the funeral home guys do it. My mother was roaming around trying to find someone to help her with the corsage situation while I finished the rest. You see, we're not allowed to touch or interact with the bodies for obvious reasons. There are a lot of laws governing how corpses are handled and there are signs in the interior back-end of funeral homes that make this very clear. My mother could not put this corsage on this body without assistance from someone that was licensed. \n\nEventually my mother gives up trying to find anyone useful to help and we're just standing in this back hallway with the body in the coffin and my mother holding the corsage. She's panicking. And then help arrives. An elderly gentleman in a suit comes walking into the hallway and instantly recognizes us - let's call him Claude. Claude was a mortician at that funeral home but he had retired a couple of years prior. Now he worked part time just covering some of the evening visitation shifts as I mentioned before. Claude would know what to do! We're approaching visitation time at 6pm when the family would arrive and Claude was here to wheel the coffin into the room. \n\nMy mother explains the corsage situation to him and Claude looks a little puzzled. The problem here is that he's not licensed anymore either. He can only wheel the coffin around - not touch the body. But he gets a glint in his eye and leans in close to my mother and says something like \"Just pin it on her without touching the body.\" My mother looks flabbergasted. A giant corsage like this requires a giant pin to attach to the dress if it's going to have any hope of staying in place. She can't pin it on her without grasping the dress and touching the body in the process. So then Claude says \"No no no.. pin it ON HER. Stick the pin straight into the body without touching it. Why not? She won't feel it. How do you think the mortician makes the body and the clothes stay in place? She's got pins stuck into her flesh all over her body right now. It's no big deal. When the mortician takes it off tonight and puts it back on in the morning, that's exactly how he'll do it.\" \n\nMy mother is basically frozen in place.. looking at the corsage.. looking at the body.. looking at Claude.. looking at me. We hear some commotion and Claude says she better hurry up - the family is coming in right now. He then tells her to do it with a lot of force because it's harder than it looks to get it in there. My mother steels herself and grips the corsage. She flips the main pin open and prepares to do it. She's standing right over the body holding this thing like an axe murderer about to strike. Just as she's about to drop the hammer, a door comes flying open and a few of the funeral home guys come spilling out and laughing their asses off. Claude starts high-fiving them. One of the morticians quickly takes the corsage from my dumbfounded mother and pins it on the dress properly and wheels the coffin into the room just in the nick of time before the family walks in. And then we saw him - my father sneaking out behind the funeral guys with this giant shit-eating grin on his face. He had orchestrated the whole thing as a prank on my mother and they had been watching through security cameras. I thought it was hilarious, but I'm pretty sure my mother didn't speak to my father for several days. She laughs about it now though.",

My understanding is that in American culture the average person won't have much if any direct interaction with human corpses in their life. So unless they go into particular careers, there is never enough exposure to make interacting with dead bodies routine. \n\nIn my culture the funeral traditions have the family (and to slightly lesser extent local community) spending several days with the corpse every time someone dies. Traditionally, it'll be laid out on the bed and there is supposed to be someone in the room with it at all times between death and the funeral a few days later. During the vigil and wake everyone filters in and out of the room with the corpse, including kids. There's food and drink as well and nobody would think twice about having a chat and a cup of tea right next to the body. \n\nAs a result there's no squeamishness around corpses, because everyone has had to spend time near them, touch them, clean them, dress them etc. from a young age.",

She had been dead for a while so the medics called her right away because of obvious signs of death. While I was there it was surreal looking at this woman laying in bed not moving a single muscle. I kept expecting her to move (blink, scratch hefr nose... Anything) but there was just... Nothing. Over the next few months I was involved with multiple cardiac arrest calls. One time I was bagging an elderly man with a self inflicted gunshot wound to the head. I bagged him all the way to the hospital subsequently getting blood all over my pants. It just so happened that my mom was the hospital chaplain so she got called into the ER to talk to and comfort the family. When she arrived at the hospital she poked her head into the back of the rescue where I was helping clean up and getting the truck back in service. She asked me if I was ok. I looked at her in the eye and said \"yeah I'm fine\" legitimately wondering why she was asking me (a 16 year old high school student) if I was ok (after literally breathing for a dead man with a hole in his head bleeding all over me). I guess I may have been desensitized a bit too early. 22 years later and after 17 years as an ER tech/secretary I will definitely agree, the dark sense of humor helps.",

Like why bring up an incel joke when we're talking about a woman who died from a pencil stuck up her cooter? There's plenty of on-topic material to make great jokes with, so why go with incels who have nothing to do with the story?\n\nIt's just bad comedy, reminds me of Dee from Always Sunny where she chimes in with a joke out of nowhere and everybody just cringes lol. Like this but with even less relevance.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/08K-944LI8s?t=60",

If I recall, correctly, Lord Templeman's opinion was particularly on the nose.\n\nContrast this with the case of R v Aitken [1992], where RAF officers lit each other on fire as as a joke and one of them suffered burns - court ruled this was OK because it was \"manly horseplay\". Bit of a double standard, eh?\n\nWell, most of this is now codified in legislation anyway so the case law has taken a back seat but I just think these showcase an interesting double standard and the underlying moral-political authority and conservatism of the judiciary.",

      "text": "During college I had an old Italian professor. He always would go into long stories about life and lessons he learned. One day he started to tell us a story about growing up with an older brother. It was a story about self worth and confidence, and went something like this (read in a _heavy_ Italian accent):\n\nWhen I grew up I had an older brother. Growing up he was always bigger and stronger than me. He used to fist me all the time, and as we got older the fisting got harder and started to hurt and hurt but he would never stop fisting me. One day though, I said enough and started to fist him back. At first my fisting wasn't very strong, but I was determined to fist him back and just kept doing it. One day I finally grew strong enough to fist him back just as hard and his fisting immediately stopped. Every time he said \"fisting,\" he would do a fisting motion in the air with his hands and we were all trying to hold back our laughter. \n\nWhen he stopped talking, the class was silent for about 30 straight seconds. Then in the chat (we were on zoom at the time) somebody posted \"uhh, did you mean to say 'punching,'\" and then posted a link to urban dictionary for \"fisting.\" The entire class erupted in laughter (including our professor) who then had to explain that the Italian word for \"punch,\" basically translates to \"to fist,\" \ud83d\ude02",

Everyone seemed to treat it as the saddest condition causing major life disruption, which it is.\n\nI was able to do that right up until they decided to test physical activity, where two narcolepsy sufferers threw a Frisbee to each other, then almost simultaneously fell to the ground asleep while the Frisbee hit one of them in the head.\n\nDid it highlight a serious condition and some of the attempts to understand the effects of different stimuli?\nAbsolutely\n\nDid it also look like some sort of absurd Monty Python skit?\nDefinitely.\n\nDid I inappropriately laugh out loud, catch the giggles and need to leave the room? \nYes, yes I did.",

The music director was very overworked, and one of his jobs was preparing the service bulletins, which contained the order of the service, hymns, and prayers.\n\nHe had started using the find and replace feature to edit funeral bulletins, replacing the name of the prior funeral's decedent with the next one. One week he had a funeral for a woman named Mary, and the next week he had a funeral for a woman named Tina.\n\nWell of course at Tina's funeral everything seemed to be going ok, until the attendees started reading prayers with phrases like \"our lord was born of the virgin Tina.\" Luckily Tina's family had a good sense of humor.",

They handed out a bunch of condoms to the students as they walked in, and of course they were immediately made into beach balls and were being tossed through the crowd. \n\nAs the sexpert started to discuss rape, how to prevent it and why you shouldn\u2019t do it, he began to tell a story much like your instructors to put a little fear in us I guess. Either way as I was sitting there, one of these condom balls came flying seemingly out of there and splatted on my friends face next to me. As she turned to me, glasses smeared with lube I couldn\u2019t help but let out a laugh. I have a very loud and distinctive laugh, which right as the room went silent boomed throughout. \n\nAs I desperately tried to stop my belly rolling and my friend started to snicker and clean off her glasses as well, the instructor turned to me and said through the mic \u201cwell, unlike some people. I don\u2019t think rape is funny\u201d\n\nHe moved on pretty quick and thankfully it was at a time when introductions were still being made and there were witnesses to corroborate my story, but I really worried my reputation was gonna be ruined there. \n\nEnjoy yourself friend.

A couple days after 9/11, my teacher was talking to us about her brothers experience, and it was truly terrible. She was pretty emotional, attempting but failing to hold back tears, and my kid brain didn't know how to handle it - so I let out a nervous laugh that the entire class heard. A girl sitting next to me was pretty offended that I was laughing at such a terrible moment.\n\nI'm guessing the teacher realized how odd the situation was - a grown woman, through tears, talking about pulling body parts from the wreckage - because she had my back, and told the class that we all process and react differently to hearing about tragedy.\n\nI did feel terrible for laughing, but it was a little too much for my kid brain to comprehend, and it was like my brain randomly chose a reaction. It was just the wrong reaction.",

May I interest you in the parts of my body?\"  \nIt harrumphed and gurgled a bit, wriggled its hind quarters in to a more comfortable position and gazed peacefully at them.  \nIts gaze was met by looks of startled bewilderment from Arthur and Trillian, a resigned shrug from Ford Prefect and naked hunger from Zaphod Beeblebrox.  \n\"Something off the shoulder perhaps?\" suggested the animal, \"braised in a white wine sauce?\"  \n\"Er, your shoulder?\" said Arthur in a horrified whisper.  \n\"But naturally my shoulder, sir,\" mooed the animal contentedly, \"nobody else's is mine to offer.\"  \nZaphod leapt to his feet and started prodding and feeling the animal's shoulder appreciatively.  \n\"Or the rump is very good,\" murmured the animal. \"I've been exercising it and eating plenty of grain, so there's a lot of good meat there.\"  \nIt gave a mellow grunt, gurgled again and started to chew the cud. It swallowed the cud again.  \n\"Or a casserole of me perhaps?\" it added.  \n\"You mean this animal actually wants us to eat it?\" whispered Trillian to Ford.  \n\"Me?\" said Ford, with a glazed look in his eyes, \"I don't mean anything.\"  \n\"That's absolutely horrible,\" exclaimed Arthur, \"the most revolting thing I've ever heard.\"  \n\"What's the problem Earthman?\" said Zaphod, now transferring his attention to the animal's enormous rump.  \n\"I just don't want to eat an animal that's standing there inviting me to,\" said Arthur, \"It's heartless.\"  \n\"Better than eating an animal that doesn't want to be eaten,\" said Zaphod.  \n\"That's not the point,\" Arthur protested. Then he thought about it for a moment. \"Alright,\" he said, \"maybe it is the point. I don't care, I'm not going to think about it now. I'll just... er \\[...\\] I think I'll just have a green salad,\" he muttered.  \n\"May I urge you to consider my liver?\" asked the animal, \"it must be very rich and tender by now, I've been force-feeding myself for months.\"  \n\"A green salad,\" said Arthur emphatically.  \n\"A green salad?\" said the animal, rolling his eyes disapprovingly at Arthur.  \n\"Are you going to tell me,\" said Arthur, \"that I shouldn't have green salad?\"  \n\"Well,\" said the animal, \"I know many vegetables that are very clear on that point. Which is why it was eventually decided to cut through the whole tangled problem and breed an animal that actually wanted to be eaten and was capable of saying so clearly and distinctly. And here I am.\"  \nIt managed a very slight bow.  \n\"Glass of water please,\" said Arthur.  \n\"Look,\" said Zaphod, \"we want to eat, we don't want to make a meal of the issues. Four rare stakes please, and hurry. We haven't eaten in five hundred and seventy-six thousand million years.\"  \nThe animal staggered to its feet. It gave a mellow gurgle. \"A very wise choice, sir, if I may say so. Very good,\" it said, \"I'll just nip off and shoot myself.\"  \nHe turned and gave a friendly wink to Arthur. \"Don't worry, sir,\" he said, \"I'll be very humane.\"  \nIt waddled unhurriedly off to the kitchen.",
