The vast majority of people, even people who do bad things, were attempting to do something good and it got out of hand, this is the case with the majority of fascist, they sought order and safety and in the process discarded morals and ethics.\n\nI'd suggest you read the testimonies of the Polish police officers during World War II if you want a clear-cut example of this.\n\nAs for me supporting fascism, I'm an anarchist, the exact opposite, the fact that I understand what they're trying to achieve doesn't make me their supporter.",

Of course it was an ancient society with a primitive economy that depended on slavery, and constant expansion to acquire more slaves, but is equally interesting the progress from slavery to serfdom as their supply chains and trade collapsed to make production more efficient without expansion, and more recently society abandoning serfdom, the path of progress has been the path of rulers recognizing the importance of the individual.\n\nI understand now you don\u2019t subscribe to fascist ideology, but I think what you see as it\u2019s pros is really selection biased to confirm previous beliefs, at the end of the day technologically and ideology other societies prevailed over fascism, they defeated it, that doesn\u2019t mean there weren\u2019t smart people living in fascist regimes which then moved to other places where they continued making progress in better environments.",

I\u2019m not surprised there is no room for you there.\n\nYour comment about the damage they produce in the process is exactly my point, one can\u2019t claim something as a pro when it\u2019s only benefit is in burning the forest, either we advance as a species or we don\u2019t and I don\u2019t believe authoritarianism makes us move forward as a species, it may hold strong destructive force but that\u2019s not necessarily a pro.\n\nThis has been an interesting conversation, here is a quote I like related to the topic:\n\n>\tThere is no common benchmark for all the things that people think are good\u2014except for a few, the ones that affect us all. So the goal should be a common one\u2014a civic one. If you direct all your energies toward that, your actions will be consistent. And so will you. \u2014 Marcus Aurelius\n\nWhat I think we need to do is work for each other, we are here for each other, value judgments are in the context of the times, goodness in humans is in being just to other humans despite our differences, and work for the benefit of humanity in general, as I see it oppression and control will never reach the full potential of our spicies and will always fail to our inherent nature, that of self aware rational creatures.",

It's strange to see, since my family immigrated in the early 20th century to get away from the disaster that was Eastern Europe. They were poor immigrants trying to escape a terrible situation. They came from serfs, which were little more than slaves and are now seen as these terrible people by some in the left part of the democratic party.

That leads them to think that things like science or facts are meaningless and can be changed by just wishing hard enough, so to them both of those things are just another thing to dispute if it doesn't fall in line with their beliefs. Climate change for example, it's undeniable but to them its just libruls fudging the numbers for their own benefit, because -thats what they do- and how they perceive things. If the results for a scientific measurement are against your theory, just fudge the numbers until it conforms to your beliefs, and you've just changed reality.\n\nToo bad that if left unchecked they'll effectively wipe out human civilization by refusing to acknowledge reality and burning it all to the ground rather than admit their beliefs are wrong. After all, even if we all die from man-made disasters, the good ones get to go to heaven, right?\n\n...right?",

Basically all environmental problems are caused directly by the effects of cities, so the single solution that will solve the problem is dispersing the populations more evenly so that the environment can naturally absorb the output of the population.\n\nObviously something that will never happen as the people in charge of it are the city dwellers and the people in cities don't want to change their lifestyles. They have the population for the vote, therefore the majority will always vote against fixing environmental damages, you can tell this by them constantly trying to push the blame solely on to corporations, the same corporations that make city-dwelling possible, I suppose it makes them feel better to say it's the other guy's fault even though the other guy is simply providing them what they need to survive.\n\nIn the end fascism rises out of the desire for order and safety, it usually achieves this through conformity, it's why I identify the current Democrat movement as extremely fascist leaning, they demand conformity with their cultural opinions as the status quo and seek legal action against non-complying people.\n\nIt's not so much a thing directly related to war like it was with Romeand there dictator, though the system of having dictators is pretty effective during wartime as Rome proved, though it actually only lasted for 6 months at a time which is pretty close to the emergency powers the president can exercise, so in the end we have pretty close to the same system.",

Carbon emissions alone are not changing the planet's atmosphere and the actual problem they create, smog, is quickly dispersed by trees if you live in the area with enough trees to disperse the amount you're putting out, this is not a issue in rural areas at all.\n\nI'm a futurist and I follow the development of space leaning technologies extremely closely. There is a large group of extremely educated scientist attempting to find a way to make a greenhouse effect happen on another planet because a greenhouse effect is what created Earth's atmosphere, if we can't do it on purpose with some of the most educated scientists in that field attempting to do so, how would we do it by accident trying not to?\n\n2. Living in small apartments is damaging to the human mind and soul, we need a natural surrounding to be at peace with oneself, and I'm not talking some to do quasi-religious flower child shit, I'm talking literally if you pack yourself into a tight box to live, surround yourself by thousands of people daily and then spend your work day packed into another tight box, it has a long-term effect on your mental well-being.\n\nAs well on the other aspect of it which is resources being put into it, how much food do you believe people who live in cities grow for themselves and their family? Sustainable is probably about 25% should be produced by the individual family unit, preferable to cut down the pollution create it trying to process, preserve and distribute food is probably 50%. Do you think that City dwellers can produce 50% of their families food growing it themselves?\n\n3. But no point in human history has Humanity lived without the consumption of meat, does it rightly seem wise to attempt to change a biological normal all at once? Even in the short-term science that's been collected on people who have attempted to go herbivore it's shown to cause multiple and massive changes in the immune system, muscle development, vitamin levels and with those three major systems of the body being affected there's a really good chance the brain is affected as well.\n\nThat's not to say that vegetarians or anything along that line are some kind of problem, but it is unwise to attempt to change the diet of an entire species that's evolved one way for tens of thousands of years on a dime.\n\nAs for corporations, I don't defend them I simply state that they are what's keeping people in cities alive, they are the ones handling all the logistic of keeping populations ranging into the millions alive in an area that is incapable of supporting them.\n\nPopulations of that magnitude in that small of an area are impossible to maintain by the self-regulating environmental systems of the Earth, the effort put into maintaining them are the direct cause of environmental damages.",

You literally have no good arguments other than \u201cShUt ThE fUcK uP\u201d. I make a lot of money too, since before the pandemic I might add. Let\u2019s look a little closer at you guys. Fascism consists of some pretty specific parts, number one being Nationalism, which is very easy to see. While patriotism can be seen in 63 percent of Americans reporting being either extremely or very proud to be an American, it should also be noted that 55 percent of people felt that white nationalism posed a very or somewhat serious threat to the U.S. Nationalism can be seen in many aspects of America today, from politics to the economy to right-wing extremism. \nNumber 2, totalitarianism. This one is obvious with the attempt to overturn the election of Jan 6 and install trump as the unelected leader.\nNumber 3, Action. Fascism emphasizes direct action, including supporting the legitimacy of political violence, as a core part of its politics. You see this ALL THE TIME just the other day the Lt gov of NC made a direct call to violence. Trump actively invited a mob to riot multiple times. Biden bus, capitol, etc.. this call to action also emphasizes the use of private militias for political violence. Proud boys, oathkeepers, police. \nNumber 4, palingenesis and modernism. Fascism emphasizes both palingenesis (national rebirth or re-creation) and modernism. In particular, fascism's nationalism has been identified as having a palingenetic character. Fascism promotes the regeneration of the nation and purging it of decadence. (Make America great again) \nAnd last but not least number 5 According to cultural critic Susan Sontag, \"[f]ascist aesthetics ... flow from (and justify) a preoccupation with situations of control, submissive behavior, extravagant effort, and the endurance of pain; they endorse two seemingly opposite states, egomania and servitude. The relations of domination and enslavement take the form of a characteristic pageantry: the massing of groups of people; the turning of people into things; the multiplication or replication of things; and the grouping of people/things around an all-powerful, hypnotic leader-figure or force. The fascist dramaturgy centers on the orgiastic transactions between mighty forces and their puppets, uniformly garbed and shown in ever swelling numbers. I mean just look at these massive crowds All decked out in their maga uniforms. \nI hope that\u2019s not too much for your small boomer mind to read. It\u2019s not a real complete list but I had to type it on the toilet while getting ready for work. Have a good day fashy!",

This info is all on google. Trump had huge numbers of high school and college drop outs vote for him. The more education someone had, the more likely they were to vote for biden. A record number of people with graduate and doctoral degrees voted for biden. Look on google about the education gap between biden and trump voters",

Or should we just forget all about any relevance to today\u2019s fortunate sons since there\u2019s no longer a draft?",

She knew of groups like Sublime, but she never pursued any of it. She stuck to classical and whatever she was learning in community band. So, she's one of those people who wouldn't have heard a whole Alice in Chains album.\n\nAt the same time, there are sort of two things about it. On the one hand, she does a lot of experimental vocal work. I also did my graduate work in heavy metal, so she's heard a lot of unusual vocal stuff, so there's not a lot there that would cause much of a surprised response or anything. \n\nOn the other, growing up being a band nerd, she's never been super crazy about showing what she doesn't know because there's always someone around to judge her for not knowing who X, Y, or Z band is. So, making a broadcast spectacle of it is an alien behavior that neither of us would understand.",

She has just listened to the same playlists and cds for the past 30 years. \n\nThe man seems to have never been curious as to what music is playing.

De la Rocha's paternal grandfather, Isaac de la Rocha Beltr\u00e1n (1910\u20131985),[10] was a Mexican revolutionary[11] who fought in the Mexican Revolution and worked as an agricultural laborer in the U.S. De la Rocha would later see the hardships his grandfather endured reflected in the struggles of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation.[12]\n\n> De la Rocha's parents divorced when he was six years old, and he moved from East Los Angeles to Irvine with his mother, who attended the University of California at Irvine and ultimately earned a PhD in anthropology.[13] De la Rocha later described Irvine as \"one of the most racist cities imaginable\" and said that \"if you were a Mexican in Irvine, you were there because you had a broom or a hammer in your left hand.\"[\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zack_de_la_Rocha",

It\u2019s all the way from the 1800s to refer to people performing hate crimes on Chinese immigrants (those weren\u2019t black people), in the 1930s it was to refer to gangsters (those were on the tail end of the roaring 20s and these are white mobsters we are referring to), it wasn\u2019t until 1987 that it got pinned to poor black communities, it also applies to Hispanic communities, Asian communities. \n\nLastly this man (my friend)refers to himself as Hood. Similar to some black people referring to themselves/each other as N****s despite it having a terrible history regarding black people. If you want to be offended by it (not pinning you) then that\u2019s on you. \n\nAnd my prayer/wish for you was genuine btw, serenity to see between the lines and love to move on and not sweat the small stuff.",

Just like a white kid from the suburbs bumping ludacris in the 2000\u2019s was fully self aware they weren\u2019t real gangsters nor were they getting big booty bitches it didn\u2019t matter because they were selling themselves a fantasy.\n\nRage\u2019s music primarily punches up. It focuses on the struggles of minorities and the injustices served to them and the populace of the world as a whole by men and women in power. To these people though, they ARE minorities and they\u2019re the rebel fighting back against a system that\u2019s aggressively harming their way of life whether that be making money, living in whatever their preacher told them is god\u2019s way, or fulfilling their own power fantasies.\n\nThese people know fully well what the music is talking about and represents. They just decided to make it about themselves instead.",

I love RATM\u2019s music, but their rage is just that, rage.  It\u2019s anger.  It\u2019s well intentioned and it\u2019s just, but it is also unfocused, ambiguous, and unproductive, just as all rage is.  Sure, they got pissed off at some very specific things, and if I\u2019m being generous, they even had a part of starting to fix some of them by drawing people\u2019s attention to some real problems\u2026good on them.\n\nas a kid, raging is all you can do, and I respect that.  As an adult, it\u2019s within our power to take action, and \u201craging\u201d is just called throwing a tantrum.  You don\u2019t like the rules that maintain a level of order?  Figure out a better solution, but when you start trying to break the machine that actually does solve all those real problems that you have never considered, don\u2019t be surprised if people defend it.\n\nYou know who is raging against the machine?  Good ol\u2019 prez trump,  brexit, and a whole wave of hyperconservatives the world over trying to reassert authoritarian ways over the machine that has ensured liberty, freedom, and relative peace.

It doesn\u2019t that I have to do whatever America tells me. And 2) it means that Americans should be able to make their own choices, and not some other nation/country like Great Britain. \n\nSo, both the founding fathers in the revolutionary war, and the Union in the civil war, were nationalists. They had an idea of America as an entity that exists called a nation, that\u2019s what nationalism is. It\u2019s not \u201cI have to follow the nation no matter what\u201d or \u201cmy nation is better than other nations\u201d it\u2019s that \u201cwe as a people have something that makes us a community separate from other people, which means we are a nation, and we should act like it.\u201d \n\nCoincidentally, those who are against roe vs. wade are actually anti-nationalists, because they believe that by law it is for the states to decide on abortion, those who would keep the electoral college are anti-nationalists as they believe that California is a separate community from Alabama and shouldn\u2019t decide what is good for Alabama, etc. a lot of the progressive agenda derives from American nationalism - that America is a nation.\n\nNote that there is nothing in there that includes that America is better than other nations, just that America is a community of people that are part of America and as such American sovereignty should be upheld, and Americans should care about other Americans.",

Nobody is above manipulation, but being educated helps you recognize when someone's doing it.  US conservatives are basically an ocean of the uneducated, voting a certain way because their church/parents told them to vote that way and enforced tribalism mentalities during their formative years.",

But the Confederate flag is not synonymous with the KKK. The Dems are however, as that organisation was primarily made up of Democrats while it was active.\n\nNow they just keep black people enslaved in a victim mentality (as we al saw last year).

So the right broadly says 'fuck off'.\n\nWe did it to religious institutions who thought their feelings deserved paramount consideration. And it worked. Now it is being done to the censorious left.\n\nOh would you now? Why? Were you unaware the Dems were the party of the KKK?",

But just like Chris Christie, I had to make a political decision and I agree with him on a lot of other issues.\"\n\n>\"The Republicans, including Trump, are all running on issues I have supported all along like limiting immigration,\" Duke said. \"The party bosses don't want to admit that. And now they're desperate to stop Donald Trump.\"\n\n>**\"Donald Trump has the potential to bring in millions of new voters who agree with our positions,\" Duke added. \"Based on the analytics, I would say my support is very strong.\"**",

Swapped, no. \n\n>So, you're saying the same democratic party that started the KKK is the same platform party (social and economic theologies and plans) as today?\n\nSouthern Dixiecrats don't exist anymore. But only one of the two parties was founded exclusively to oppose the expansion of slavery, so I'd imagine they wouldn't support the Republicans. \n\n>Also, what are your thoughts on these: they provide varying years of party platform switches?\n\nYou must not be reading these. Because you're still conflating the Democrats shift from the agricultural south in favor of federal programs, and the absorption of the southern block through economic policies aimed at the lower and middle class, with the republican party somehow becoming the slaver owners they went to war with. \n\nBtw, I'm an indeoendent liberal with a degree in poli sci. This is by far the most common misargued and misunderstood topics by democrats.",

Libertarians and minarchists generally believe that the state has a *legitimate* monopoly on the use of force, and that the only things the government should be involved in are: the military, the courts, and policing.

An ancap could be fundamentally opposed to the police I guess, but let's not get into ancap beliefs.\n\nAnd anyway, Rise Against doesn't really do a lot of anti-cop music, they focus more on things like environmentalism, war, lgbt suicide, and general oppression under capitalism. They're a very different band from Rage Against the Machine.",

Meeting and talking to some particular people in my life, noticing some hypocrisy from some libertarian friends, trying to resolve some paradoxes with the NAP (and failing to do so), being exposed to some left-leaning folks on YouTube, seeing many libertarians (fail to) react to the lunacy of the Trump presidency, struggling to come up with a libertarian plan of action for tackling climate change, etc etc. The whole process started for me around like 2015, and took maybe a year and a half until I was at the point where I was confident in saying that I was not a libertarian.\n\nOne big one was reading [Why I Hate Your Freedom](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/02/22/repost-the-non-libertarian-faq/) by Scott Alexander. He's not a leftist (he's essentially a Democrat) but he's clever, and it's a pretty thorough takedown by someone who clearly knows their way around the libertarian philosophy. There is a response blog post out there, but I personally found it a lot less convincing, and this was back when I was still on board with libertarianism. I think this planted the seed of doubt for me that all of the above things watered.\n\nIt helped that I'd previously talked with some ancaps about their beliefs, which (despite the fact that most anarchists will say \u2013 rightly I think \u2013 that it's not real anarchism) let me ease myself into leftist theory by reading some anarchist works (e.g. the bread book). It also helped that I bounced hard off of the more right-wing content creators when the algorithm recommended them to me; I never liked folks like Shapiro, Crowder, or Jones, so I never got overly comfortable with their taking points. \n\nIf you're asking because you've got someone in your life you want to bring around, I'm not sure if I can give any better advice than to just take their ideas seriously and ask a lot of questions. I believe the ideology is fundamentally contradictory in a lot of ways, but they're subtle ways that rarely received good criticism from people who hadn't ever really engaged with the philosophy. Probably unsurprisingly, the arguments that seem like slam dunks from a leftist perspective don't land for libertarians, there's too much of a gap in fundamental worldview. Libertarianisn ultimately doesn't make sense from *within* its own worldview, and that's what ended up convincing me. Once the ideology went, I was free to question the worldview it was built on. Everyone's different though, ymmv.",

              "text": ">Considering most of RATM\u2019s popularity was gained directly because of their headstrong anti-authority political viewpoint, surely a clash of cultures was about to ensue, no matter what happened.\n\nTo make matters worse, on this particular night, the show\u2019s guest host was none other than billionaire and then-Presidential candidate, Steve Forbes \u2014 surely a prime candidate for the band\u2019s fury. It was a recipe for destruction and one that RATM wanted to add their own ingredients. According to guitarist Tom Morello: \u201cRATM wanted to stand in sharp juxtaposition to a billionaire telling jokes and promoting his flat tax by making our own statement.\u201d\n\nThe band made their political statement in a more subtle way than you maybe would have hoped for. They made their statement by deliberately hanging American flags upside down from their amplifiers as they took the stage to perform \u2018Bulls on Parade\u2019. While it may feel a little tame by the band\u2019s standards, it was enough to enrage the patriotic producers on hand that night and stagehands were sent in to remove the flags.\n\nAfter the flags were pulled, almost instantaneously, and the first performance of the evening concluded, officials approached Rage Against The Machine and ordered them to immediately leave the building like an angry headmaster.\n\nRage wouldn\u2019t go easy though. Instead, upon hearing of their expulsion from the building, bassist Tim Commerford stormed Forbes\u2019 dressing room throwing bits of the recently torn flag as he went. Morello said that members of the SNL team \u201cexpressed solidarity with our actions, and a sense of shame that their show had censored the performance.\u201d It\u2019s a tale as old as time, but it\u2019s clear that, at the time, SNL producers were very fearful of repercussions.\n\nLMFAO, what was SNL fucking thinking? I wonder what RATM had planned for *Bullet in the Head*, the next song they were supposed to do.\n\n[https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/rage-against-the-machine-banned-saturday-night-live-snl-1996/](https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/rage-against-the-machine-banned-saturday-night-live-snl-1996/)",

In that moment, they are feeling the *precise* emotions a toddler feels when Mommy tells them the dreaded, \"EN. OH.\", and their only possible recourse, since they can't violently shit their pants (or they at least possess *just* enough cognizance of consequence to avoid doing so), they throw an embarrassing tantrum. Or at least it should be embarrassing, but how can a clown feel like they stick out when they never leave the circus?",

Not content with repeating this to each other, they also demanded that Dems believed it too. They claim it hateful, or disrespectful or phobic to not believe it. After while you might be like \"hey, I'm glad you think the world is flat, but I don't, and neither does the current scientific understanding. Stop trying to make me believe this nonsense\".\n\nWould you not react this way?\n\nWell it's the same with trans issues. Most people don't give a shit what people dress up as, it believe they are. But when you have the President saying \"trans women are women\", it's concerning because it's like he is saying the Earth is flat. \n\nYes, nobody truly believes transeomen are women, but some people say it to avoid hurt feels. That's ok.\n\nBut when you have dudes on the same sports team as your daughter, it dudes sharing bathrooms with her, things have moved from the theoretical to the very very real.",

Then you explain that the song is about police brutality and people railing against them. \n\nAnd somehow \"I'm so off\".....ok then.\n\n\nThat is an interesting mind you have there, curious how you can state that non sequitur of me boing \"so off\" and not realise you had the same interpretation I did. Oh well.\n\n\nYeah I mean it makes sense now that Republicans would resonate with that song more now. I mean the Dem party were the KKK members, and they sure like being white, which we saw during the BLM riots where all the whiteys burned down black businesses and said they were against racism. Hilarious.\n\nEven funnier is that the Dems are the ones telling everyone what is permitted speech and thought, and the Republicans are the \"fuck you\" party.",

Please go and read up about it  before trying to act smug. first of all no it is not better to get natural immunity, vaccinations give you protection for much longer and vaccines do prevent you from getting it and and from spreading it that to by a huge margin and you see when unvaccinated people move about the result is that the virus stays in your system longer and has less resistance which in turn gives it time to mutate just like it has mutated. If people just went about it won't be long till the virus mutates and becomes more powerful and starts killing more people. The amount of healthy people that have does after it mutated is nothing to scoff at.\n\n\nI request you to please go and search about your claims and you will find out there is absolutely nothing backing your claims and almost everything you said is untrue.

Covid being man made is like entirely taken as a conspiracy theory the other more plausible and based in reality scenario taken is that it was a leak as the laboratory was researching corona virus in bats\n\nThis is literally what I am talking about, the gain-of-function research that occurred on bat-derived Coronaviruses at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.\n\nWhat exactly do you think an artificial virus is? It is artificial because it didn't occur in nature, it was developed in a lab designed to make viruses more contagious and symptomatic and than finding solutions to defeat it.\n\nPeople think this is outlandish, but it is exactly what occurred in 1977 with the Russian flu.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4542197/\n\nThis research paper from the American Institute of Microbiology shows the evidence that the Russian flu was probably created in a lab doing gain-of-function research (Relevant, 40 citations) \n\n\n>No it is not opinion\n\nYes, it is an opinion, it says it at the very top of the article.",

We have found 1000s of relatives to the 2002 Sars outbreak due to the diligent work of scientists pulling samples for the past 20 years. \n\nSo far we have found one relative to the current outbreak... In northern Laos, Southern China, nowhere near Wuhan. \n\nYou haven't engaged in any of my other statements, if you only want to conversate on this topic discuss it with someone else, because unfortunately for any definitive answer we would need research papers from the future.",

[More information](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.3181/0903-MR-94) \n\nWhile I do believe it started from a lab leak, I have always hypothesized that it was an accidental leak from the lab studying coronaviruses and not purposefully engineered to wreak this much havoc. I'm sure China tried to eliminate any evidence of their involvement but any sane government would do the same. I also don't think CCP bots are downvoting your comment and it has more to do with your hostile tone and conspiracy theories.",

This is my Dad's favorite Rage song because to him it represents the plight of all of his generation. \n\n\"All we wanted was our freedom! That's all we wanted.\"\n\nThe song is about the Pine Ridge shootings that led to an activist getting two consequence life sentences after the death of two federal agents, on a trial that is widely considered to be bogus. \n\nMy father is the son of a longshoreman and accountant, and while he was poor growing up, always had an in to get a decent job at a moments notice do to his social connections. He literally has all the freedom anyone could possibly want outside of pot being illegal (if you were black) in the 90's. \n\nIt was an astounding moment for me lol.",

These people are... moshing... I guess... to a song about police being murdering racists while wearing thin blue line garbage. They are there to support a sitting president who had been vocally pro-police brutality and anti-criticism. For instance suggesting cops should be more violent by bashing the heads of arrested suspects in the doors of cop cars comes to mind, as well as calling kneeling NFL plays \"sons of bitches\" for their peaceful demonstration. I would also point out how much of the MAGA crowd threw a hissy fit when Morello had \"fuck trump\" on his guitar. These people can believe this song is an anthem for them to \"fight the power\" as they may think they are doing, but that makes them profoundly dumb.",

Rather I\u2019ll just quote it here to save you time and others to see your ignorance. After this I\u2019m done wasting any of my brain cells on you.\n\n>When Moses went up into Mount Sinai to receive the Ten Commandments (Exodus 24:12\u201318), he left the Israelites for forty days and nights. The Israelites feared that he would not return and demanded that Aaron make them \"a god to go before them\". Aaron gathered up the Israelites' golden earrings and ornaments, constructed a \"molten calf\" and they declared: \"'This is thy god, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt\" (Exodus 32:1\u20134). Aaron built an altar before the calf and proclaimed the next day to be a feast to the LORD. So they rose up early the next day and \"offered burnt-offerings, and brought peace-offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.\" (Exodus 32:6)",

They oppose the aspects of government and capitalism that perpetuate racism, oppression and inequity. They will point out the atrocities of the past. They don't and never did fight against public health. So as you wrongfully characterize the band you think they should be against public health measures just because the government endorses it? Glad they are smarter than you, and help their fans do what is right for society, which is what they have always stood for. People who fail to see this as a public health crisis, and that being vaccinated is your duty to the society you live in are just selfish people. Anyone who thinks like that could not possibly be a Rage fan, because you really miss their message.",

Their gender does not match their biological sex, but their biological sex remains objectively present, despite the gender performance.\n\nYes, exactly; and thus affirming their personal identity is factually correct. The only thing that identifies people as men or women is gender, which MOST of the time it matches up with their sex - but when that is not true, we have to acknowledge the internal state of the person as opposed to the external state of their genitalia.\n\nIt is INDEED an important distinction, I agree with you; but maybe not for the same reasons as what you would state.\n\nTrans women ARE women, but they are NOT cis women. It's important to make that distinction because we should acknowledge the unique experiences of trans women. It's also important for sexual preference, as many people wouldn't prefer to date a trans person - and that's ok! - but if this is literally the only thing that affects others when calling them women, why not just call them women; and make the distinction when it actually matters, like when trying to date someone?\n\nIt's not just about feelings, it's about the objective psychological reality of people. They are the wrong sex in their heads, and their brains are wired more closely to the gender that they identify by - and when people merely affirm their gender identity - they are perfectly functional human beings. When people deny their gender identity, it causes great trauma and distress. This isn't just about feelings, it's about affirming their literal existence as they psychologically identify.",

I understand saying that they are male simply because they have male sex organs might seem like common sense, but in their minds, their sex organs don't match their identity.\n\n>The fact that transwomen are males is not in dispute\n\nThey have male sex organs, yes.

Only in pure sex terms.\n\n>One cannot \"identify\" in and out of these categories\n\nYou can definitely get surgeries or other interventions, but you don't need to have surgery to identify as a gender that is different from your sex. We as a society only identify people by their sex at birth, after that we identify people by their gender - which most of the time those 2 match! But not every time, and that is ok. You are mixing up gender and sex.\n\n>But one cannot identify in and out of being male or female, so you are wrong there I'm afraid.\n\nBut you can out of being man or woman. That is trans man or trans woman.\n\n>I do not deny their existence by acknowledging a transwomen is male\n\nYou kinda do though, because you're not validating them as they see themselves. You can insist that they have a penis (if they still do and are a trans woman) but that doesn't change the fact that they identify as women, and should be seen as such. Not CIS women, but still women.\n\n> I am saying that under our current understanding of biological science, a transwomen is in the 'male' category.\n\nOnly if you're classifying them by their sex, and not by their gender.\nIn the category of gender, they are women (or men for trans men).\n\n>They were never female at any point.\n\nThey were born women because their brains are closer to those of cis women than those of men.\n\n>So you are incorrect to suggest transwomen have a 'female reality', as they are not biologically female.\n\nBecause sex and gender are not the same, and you seem to be confused about that. They don't have to be biologically female to identify and be seen as women by gender.\n\n>There are two broad groups. Males, and females. Within males exist men, transwomen, and others of male biological makeup.\n\nOnly when you're purely talking about sex organs. When you get into gender, trans women are women - and trans men are men. Still distinct from CIS men and women, but still men and women.\n\n> But lying to them about reality will not help in the long term.\n\nScience and medicine disagree with you. Because trans women's brains are closer to cis women's brains, telling them that they are male invalidates their existence and causes them great psychological harm and distress. When people acknowledge that they are women (even if they acknowledge they are NOT the same as CIS women), they can live long, healthy, and productive lives.\n\nSo according to all psychologists, this IS actually the best strategy. Not to mention according to trans people themselves, which neither one of us are, so it's not very intuitive - but this is what they always say when trying to learn more about this.",

The reason we are no longer \"energy independent\" is because a lot of small oil producers went out of business during 2020 because demand for oil plummeted during the pandemic. Since Trump let all these small producers fail, I guess that was his fault wasn't it?\n\n>High employment rate, and creation of jobs especially for underserved communities (blacks for example).\n\nThis statistic is just plain false, and the high employment of pre-COVID just showed how UNDER employed people were. After COVID, people decided they didn't want their shit job anymore and people started quitting en masse.\n\n>What's the Dem policy ideas? Absolutely nothing, except spend spend spend. Spend all the money. Buy everyone's vote. Tell the country everybody is racist, and the way to solve it is to keep spending!\n\nYou have to spend money to make money. Infrastructure is in shambles, a lot of people who quit their jobs did so because they didn't have childcare, and climate change is threatening to destroy most life on earth over the next couple of centuries. The latest Dem bill attempts to address all those things, yet republicans WANT to destroy most life on earth - in the name of short term profits.",

It's the easiest reasoning in the world.\n\n> How much? And you think it makes sense that black people should pay taxes so that they can lay for other black people's 'reparations'? How would that work?\n\nYes, because it would be a federal program. Reparations should be done in the form of investment in communities of color that have been underinvested for centuries. Those schools should be improved, loans granted, businesses subsidized, infrastructure improved - and if that happens to benefit a few poor white folks, then so be it - and if that happens to fall as a share of some black people's taxes, then so be it. It's about investment in areas that were robbed of investment. On a smaller scale it should also be done as direct payments to the descendants of slaves. How much? I don't know, but we should talk about how much would be fair.\n\n>Why don't you get off your ass and get a job, instead of playing the victim and pretending everybody owes you a living.\n\nI'm not black, but I would gladly have my taxes go into underinvested communities. I have a job, probably a better one than you do.\n\n>You are motivated by pure resentment. Not anything even close to Justice.\n\nSo paying for labor is resentment?

That's about it.\n\n>That's like saying the Dems are trying to ban science books, because some fringe groups think men can be women and find biological reality to be Amin to a hate crime.\n\nActually, liberals and pro LGBTQ people are far more scientifically inclined than the republicans who hate trans people and want to deny their existence. No one said men can be women; trans women are born with brains that are wired like those of cis women. Obviously trans women are not CIS women, but they are not men either.",
