And the Americans, thinking: \"Well, they must know what bread is but surely they don't have toasters here\", went: \"This is toast\" and Germans accepted it as a fact that Americans didn't know about bread but instead ate this white stuff called toast. \n\nWhat's more interesting to me is that Toast seems to be neuter to you. I say das Toastbrot (because Brot is neuter) but der Toast. That might indeed be regional though.",

It is not - the vegetable that grows on the plant is a cucumber that is used for pickling, the process through which it becomes a pickle.\n\nThey were literally arguing that pickles are not made from cucumbers.  They are.  You even indicated as such in your reply.\n\n*\"It's kinda like how Brussels sprouts and cauliflower are the same species as each other but it's still fair to say \"two different vegetables from two different plants\".\"*\n\nNope - they were saying that the vegetable that becomes a pickle through the process of pickling is not a cucumber.  It is.",

And he brought me into a vast farmland of our own Midwest. And as we descended, cries of impending doom rose from the soil. One thousand, nay, a million voices full of fear. And terror possessed me then. And I begged, \"Angel of the Lord, what are these tortured screams?\"\nAnd the angel said unto me, \"These are the cries of the carrots. The cries of the carrots. You see, Reverend Maynard, tomorrow is harvest day and to them it is the holocaust\". And I sprang from my slumber drenched in sweat like the tears of one million terrified brothers and roared, \"Hear me now, I have seen the light! They have a consciousness, they have a life, they have a soul! Damn you! Let the rabbits wear glasses! Save our brothers!\" Can I get an amen? Can I get a hallelujah? Thank you, Jesus",

I just thought you might find it interesting to know that if you ordered a cheese and pickle sandwich in the UK, it wouldn't include any \"pickles\". \n\nWe also don't usually have as large pickles as you (I'm assuming you're American?) have in America (Dino's Pickles are actually sold in the \"USA\" section of our supermarkets), and would often refer to \"gherkins\" instead because that's what we usually have. Heck, we even nicknamed a building in London \"The Gherkin\" (but I think it looks like something else).\n\nAlso, to add to your point, no one in the UK would ever pluralise Branston Pickle to \"pickles\", so if someone said that they wanted \"pickles\" they would realise you mean pickled cucumber.",

Like selling \"eggs\" vs \"duck eggs\". Both eggs, one is just so common it's assumed. \n\nAnd in NA anyway, gherkin is a specific type of pickled cucumber.

Yes, I realise - rereading my comment I haven\u2019t expressed it well. I\u2019m not trying to correct anybody\u2019s use of English. No - I don\u2019t think we have more variety- but what I do think is that we are as likely to have a jar of pickled onions in our fridge as pickled cucumber. The point being - pickled cucumbers in a British fridge are less ubiquitous. \n\nWhen I was a kid if I saw in America movies or a TV show etc. someone talking about \u201cpickles\u201d I didn\u2019t actually know what they were talking about - I thought it was something different to what we had. And it kind of is. We just don\u2019t eat/have pickled cucumbers on the same scale. \n\nI feel you\u2019ve assumed I\u2019m trying to demonstrate superiority - but what I was actually trying to do was share cultural difference. \n\nI\u2019m sure you have a similar thing in the US - but different pickled items get eaten slightly more - regionally: in Lancashire ( North West England) people are more likely to have pickled red cabbage (not the same as Sauerkraut or Kimchi or anything like that. It\u2019s just a vinegary red cabbage) which is an excellent accompaniment to Lancashire Hotpot. In many fish and chip shops there\u2019ll be a large jar of pickled eggs on the counter. And so on. \n\nThe thing is - I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there is a much larger variety of pickled things available in the USA. I don\u2019t think the British consume as many pickled foods as Americans. That was really my point about the gherkins - they are one of a few products that we are equally as likely to have in our fridges - so they haven\u2019t claimed the word \u201cpickles\u201d for themselves. And - when using the term \u201cpickle\u201d we are much more likely to be referring to a type of chutney that we eat with cheese. \n\nSo - again - just sharing cultural differences for anyone who\u2019s interested. Not claiming superiority and certainly not claiming we have more pickled things than you.",

The diminutive just means they are small. As small cucumbers are usually the ones being pickled, \"saure G\u00fcrkchen\" (sour little cucumbers) is often abbreviated to just G\u00fcrkchen (little cucumbers).\n\nMy English dictionary describes gherkin as cucumbers in vinegar, cucumbers with spices, salted cucumbers, cucumbers in mustard or plain cucumbers. So I'm not sure what it describes exactly but it seems to be a dish (aka pickles) rather than a specific plant. \n\nMy guess is that German immigrants brought the dish over to America and when they were asked what it was, they said \"G\u00fcrkchen\" meaning \"small cucumbers\" and the English speaking people there just thought the specific dish of pickled cucumbers was called \"G\u00fcrkchen/gherkin\".",
