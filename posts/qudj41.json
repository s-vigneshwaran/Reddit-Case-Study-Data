Testosterone and estrogen are two such chemicals, and aromatase is the enzyme that maintains the balance between them. Occasionally some people have too much or too little aromatase, or their body is more convenient for the reaction or less. \n\nI don't know why myself (if someone does please tell me) but it is true that the reaction that turns testosterone into estrogen via aromatase is more efficient or more likely in body fat than in other tissues such as muscle or blood. Consuming fats can, in theory, lead to more estrogen being produced, but that's essentially because all of our hormones are produced from dietary fats. Having a more fat heavy diet than others will not mean you have more estrogen than others. It *may* produce more estrogen, but only if the diet goes along with more body fat as well.",
