We would frantically use it message or call loved ones (who were still willing to talk us) send out some messages, catch up from the day before, etc. On weekends we\u2019d get a little longer. Judging by the post time and comment replies , you had about an hour too. And you decided to use it to ask people who you don\u2019t know tell you nasty things about yourselves. It\u2019s no different from the alcohol , just another way to not deal with your feelings and emotions. Put your phone down, look inside yourself and decide if this the roast that changed your life, or some text on a screen that fades off into the distant as your addiction gets progressively worse, which it can and will left untreated. I wish you nothing but love and support, you got this. Don\u2019t be afraid to succeed",

The biochemical response we can develop to drugs/alcohol is about as strong or more as needing oxygen. Doesn't make a lot of sense to be ashamed about that to me.\n\nPeople who are able to stop and stay clean, by whatever means, after becoming dependent, have got to be some of the strongest people around. And I don't think that strength is erased if you slip up a couple times.\n\nAnyway, you got this. And if you ever feel like you've got yourself on a one-way descending spiral staircase, take a moment and remind yourself that it's not real. In any moment, you're just at another fork in the road.",
