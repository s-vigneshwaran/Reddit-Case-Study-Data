In other words, I am beholden to the mentality of \"The trash takes itself out\".

Real tribes are discovered only at two ends of the spectrum: \n\n- When you are at your very best\n\n- When you are at your very worst\n\nHence, it goes without saying:\n\n- The positive people in your tribe are equally positive towards you during your best & worst moments. \n\n- The negative people in your tribe are equally negative towards you during your best & worst moments. \n\n- The neutral people (**Worst kind**) are as negative towards you during your worst moments as they are positive towards you during your best moments.",
