I've stayed informed and disgusted by the tactics of the right and it's taking a toll on my mental health and how I see others around me. I live in a small city that is mostly republican and can't help but think most of the people I associate with are down with what the right is doing. I just can't believe people are so gullible, ignorant, and morally corrupt to follow this man and believe with all their hearts that he is doing what's best for American.\n\nI know there's brainwashing and radicalization happening, but the number of people who have given up their critical thinking is astounding. And worse, there's almost no getting them back their belief in this charade. To many people on the right, I'm the conspiracy theorist and the one who needs to re-think my values to do what's right.\n\nI'm tired of it all, pretending to be part of a family and community where common values and decency to other humans are so misaligned. I don't know if this timeline was inevitable but I'm worried about the future and feel like we're in for bad times ahead.",

They saw right through the bullshit and jumped ship. Of course, there are still a few nutjobs hanging around, but we can't ban them from the dinner table until great-grandma either says so or passes away. \n\nDespite all of that, I'm extremely pessimistic about the future of this country.

The radical choices and conversations taken place are as frightening as the Florida man we thought was the start of a zombie apocalypse a few years back. \nIt's disgusting to say the least and I think the feelings are mutual across the board. I wish this shit could stop and we see that there isn't two sides or family vs family but roles in control that are damning us. I think the eat the rich ideology is pointed in that direction, but its now led by a democratic ideology and will be shunned effortlessly by radicalized republicans and that's what the powers be want. Great distractions from power moves they make; irreversible and bold slaps in our faces. These conversations and causes of inflation for starters, do we really believe prices will go down when supply chains \"recover\". Fuck no, because you've seen it too, the sheer waste and disposals of goods that major players are doing to prevent people from eating and cutting into profits. It's a sham.\n\nEven my rambling has gotten worse, of course I wanted to really say I agree with the sentiment but add to the idea in the same breathe.",

Furthermore, popular vote margins don't matter at all. Nothing you're saying is anything more than platitudes. We have the system we have, and within it, Trump is still very powerful and an existential threat to democracy.\n\nAlso, Republicans may be less than half the country, but they're still -nearly- half the country, and they're radicalizing quickly. It disturbs me how you're trying to downplay them as a tiny fraction with outsized power. 43% of the nation is becoming increasingly accepting of the idea of overturning democracy itself.\n\nMore has been done with less.",
