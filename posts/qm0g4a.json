The fact that many are hidden in fursuits that hide their true identity, and if not actually dressing up at events, are often, in complement to this notion; attracted to places on the internet where anonymity is normal, i think, becomes a catalyst to this ritual in which they become more 'attuned', for lack of a better word, to their physiology and free from the sauron's-eye of society. \n\nThe problem with this animal-attunement, is that on the spectrum between memes and genes, the body being a genetic construction, society being a memetic one; the 'attunement' with the body places one in the room with the same unconscious creature that the Nazi's awoke; the ethnic beast; the \"*us in this group, whose boundaries are genetic*\".",

They've accepted that reality need play no part in their world, they don't need their ideology to be grounded in reality which is the same as Nazism, it's just a self delusion losers use to mentally dissociate from their actual existence 'I'm the master race and its no my fault everyone thinks I'm a loser, they're the loser!'",

Like the closest I've ever seen anyone use the flag in the way you're describing is like newly out, young trans people and it's usually just them going a bit overboard because they're happy they've finally figured out their gender expression. Like the flag just isn't about any ideology, it's mostly a symbol of self expression. Like even being generous like ig I've seen cis people use it to show they support trans people but still that's not really an ideology, it's just like a single idea.\n\nOkay, like for example, I own a pair of converse high tops that have the same color scheme as the trans flag, because I custom ordered them that way. They're the same price as normal converse, and I bought them as a way of showing pride in who I was when I was early on in my transition. \n\nCompare this to a pair of democrat (big d) themed pajamas I own. My mom bought them for me (i'm not a democrat, I'm further left than that). Those ***are*** ideological, they show support for a broad range of ideas and support a political party. They're not about identity at all, but are an expression of like \"hey, I largely support democratic (big d) ideas\".",

It\u2019s a weird tightrope and honestly, I think politics hitting the conversation before real insight into who should or shouldn\u2019t transition hasn\u2019t been super helpful.

Will they marry another actual dog or a 65 year old born male now in the body of a Japanese children's cartoon character? Which would be more disturbing? How do you feel when your parents both look your age? Do you let your dad hang out with you and your school friends and talk about makeup and boys? \n\nThe further we progress the more complicated and troubling these questions become.",
