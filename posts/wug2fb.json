Damn girl, you may be sad, desperate and ugly in real life, but didn't anyone tell you that you can at least *pretend* to not be those things on the internet?",

It's definitely not an alternative account, I am a 25 year old Aussie guy that had my Gmail hacked in march and had to create a new email, therefore I made a new account for everything that I remembered I had.
