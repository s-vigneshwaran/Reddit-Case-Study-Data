Southern hospitality, ya know. A crowd gathers outside Lot's door. They wanna tie up and fuck the angels up their ass. Southern hospitality, ya know.!<\n\n>!Lot, being wise to defuse tense situations, says \"No way, Sodomites. How about you rape my 2 daughters instead? They've never had a dick in 'em!\" Southern hospitality, ya know.!<\n\n>!The crowd refused, saying they were rock hard for some struggling angelic anal. So the angels blasted them with some angelic hocus pocus and made all the rape-lusting Sodomites blind. The angels said, \"Dude. Uncool. They wanted to rape us. You should leave here. Thanks for offering your daughters' vaginas for us though. Smart. That's tops with the big guy upstairs\"!<\n\n>!So Lot and his family fled. God, being an all loving homophobe decided his perfect creations in Sodom and Gamora was FUBAR. So he starts blasting. Lot's wife got salty about it and stayed still. So Lot and his daughters fled. !<\n\n>!They eventually find a cozy cave. Lot's daughters decided it was time they fulfilled their godly purpose and incubate some kids. Time to find the nearest penis! Plus it WAS pretty cool of their dad to sacrifice their virginity to a violent gangbang. So the daughters decided to take turns each night to get daddy Lot sloppy drunk and fuck him relentlessly until they each got pregnant. Southern hospitality, ya know.!<\n\n>!Lot's inbred grandchildren sons would create the Hebrew Kingdoms of Moab and Ammon.!<",

So all Abrahamic religions have the Pentateuch (though there are differences in the versions. Especially Islam's version, which lightens up a few story points, but doubles down on the homosexuality is bad). Which means there's a similar tale for Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Though this take is more specific to the Christian versions.\n\nIt IS before Jesus and the New Testament. So Christians make up a million excuses over. God, for \"*mysterious ways*\", had to do fucked up shit before Jesus.\n\nIt's just one of my go-tos for those that think there's nothing but wholesome and goodness in the Bible. For reference, Judges 19 is basically just as fucked up. But the story of Lot and Sodom and Gomorrah is a big go-to for lots of people to justify how God doesn't approve of homosexuality - as if *that's* the most fucked up part of the story.",

You cannot believe the Bible is the literal word of god and think it is morale. \n\nHere's more:\n\n* The entire Book of Job. In summary, Job is a well off dude. A nice family. Good investment in stocks (that's an animal pun). Nice house. Strong believer in God. Satan says, \"Yo, God. This non-jewish dude, Job? He only likes you because he's got this sweet-ass life.\" God, in a series of bets, invites Satan to go and kill all his animals, his wife, his kids, wrecks his home, steals all his money, gives him all sorts of fucked up diseases. We even have something called Job's syndrome today, named after the fucked up stuff. As God stays in the spectator's suite doing nothing, Job stays faithful. In the end, God is all, \"Good job, Job.\" And the all powerful God that can do anything does NOTHING to fix his life back up.\n\n\n* 2 Kings 2. Some kids tease one of God's prophets for being bald, as kids do. So the prophet, using God's name, has a couple of bears maul FOURTY-TWO boys to death, as god does. Kids. Children. Bears.\n\n\n* Exodus 11. God kills nearly every first-born in Egypt to convince Pharaoh to let his people go, only after God had \"hardened Pharaoh's heart\" multiple times, to make him refuse to let his people go.\n\n\n* Numbers 31. God has his people commit genocide against a group of people. They were to kill every man and boy. Then we're to check to see if a woman's hyman was broken. If yes, then kill. If no, take as a sex slave.\n\n\n* Judges 11-12. This guy named Jephthah goes off to battle. But before he leaves, he says, \"When I come back, the first thing that comes out my door is going to be killed and set on fire in a sacrifice to God.\" When he got back, his daughter walked out. And Jephthah is all, \"Well, that sucks. But a promise is a promise!\"",

It was preceded (in Europe) by a much, much worse system of Feudal Aristocracy where elites wasted the vast majority of land rents on consumption (fancy parties, silk clothes, etc) and common people were stuck in a Malthusian cycle of bare-sustenance. The early capitalist farmers *immediately and dramatically* (\\~.6% per year starting in the 1650s) began improving agricultural productivity, and this is responsible for kickstarting the process that lifted almost literally everyone who is not in poverty out of poverty.\n\n\"If not over a billion\" is a laughable understatement.\n\nNone of this in any way contradicts the fact that the system of capitalism arose in a context of protestant thought.",

Only God is sinless. \"He\" is ambiguous as to whether or not it refers to a human being in the crowd, or to god. \"Who\" shares this ambiguity, and there's the additional connotation of it being a pronoun and a question word (I know this is also true in latin and greek - not 100% on aramaic).\n\n(Also, as some additional context, the issue of \"person\" and \"human\" as applied to god are the central issues behind every major christian schism prior to the Great Schism)\n\nIf you say, \"let god, a being without sin, cast the first stone\" you jump straight to the conclusion that human beings shouldn't be throwing stones at one another. \"Let he who is without sin cast the first stone\" invites the listener to go on a mental journey trying to evaluate the ambiguous pronouns.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Did you forget the point of this thread? \n\nIs that pronouns are important\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> I don't get why you adding so much lol you thinking too hard \n\nThis is the bible, the most poured-over text in the history of mankind, lol.",

As such, the usages became transposed by the arrival of modern English, until the no longer very useful, not particularly formal thou was dropped entirely in favor of the nebulously numbered you.\n\nOne consequence is that modern English keeps trying to reinvent a distinctively plural you, and that's why we get youse guys, y'all and you all.",

In the two examples I gave, one is an implied 'I' whereas the other is an implied 'we.'\n\nAnd this is my point: clearly there is a null subject and *some* subject is implied.

As this argument and entire post was not about first person pronouns, my point still stands, the Hebrew version does not have Thou as a pronoun like in the english and latin versions, the only pronoun is I and it is in referance to Elohim, which is genderless, and so is the pronoun I. This post, And I can't stress this enough was about genders and gendered pronouns, so stop thinking you are hot shit because you can use google translate or some shit, \u05dc\u05da is not used as a pronoun in Hebrew. Every other commandment is pgrased as a command with no actual subject in the sentence, however as I said in an another comment, every verb is gendered in Hebrew. So words like \u05ea\u05e9\u05d0, \u05d6\u05db\u05d5\u05e8, \u05db\u05d1\u05d3 and also \u05dc\u05da can relate to there being a subject without having a pronoun, so except for the forst commandment that has I in it, which again, earlier I spoke from memory and I forgot about that commandment, no other commandment has a pronoun in it, so yes, I was wrong, but not wildly, and relating to this post and earlier threads, my point still stands",

Not to mention, this is the FIRST time you\u2019ve mentioned gender. In fact, looking through the thread, NOBODY has mentioned gender until just now as far as I can tell.\n\nThis post and every single comment you\u2019ve made has stated incorrectly that the Bible doesn\u2019t have pronouns. Neither you nor the OP image specified gendered pronouns (which the Bible has too). \n\nKeep trying to gaslight and move the goalposts, it\u2019s hilarious!

Your histerical man, I'm not a native english speaker so I don't really understand what does your description of \u05dc\u05da means but as a native Hebrew speaker I can tell you \u05dc\u05da isn't used as a pronoun, because it is like two joined words together, Hebrew is kind of a weird language and I have no way to explain to you why in english because of some words i just don't know the translation but I can tell you this, look through other threads, read the post again, and try to tell me this isn't about gender, yeah this woman in the post is wrong, you can find pronouns in the first chapter of the bible, but if you use your head and infer a bit, you can see that she isn't simply stating a fact, she's trying to make a point for why pronouns (in her opinion) are wrong or something? I don't really know but come on, this is obviously about genders",

I've searched your name up in the Navy SEAL database and you have never even graduated BUD/S, hell, even served in the Armed Forces. If you were actually a Navy SEAL, then you actually know how to spell guerrilla, you fucking moron. And you say you are the top sniper in the entire US Armed Forces and have over 300 confirmed kills. If that were true, then why the fuck is Chris Kyle a household name and you aren't? And plus he only had 160 kills. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. Plus why the fuck would you say you have a secret network of spies yet you just revealed that you had your secret network of spies? Are you a fucking idiot? If you can kill someone seven-hundred different ways, then list them all, I bet you can't even come up with seven. And if you had access to the entire US Marine Corps arsenal, then why the fuck did you just say you were in the Navy SEALs earlier? If only you could have done your research prior to posting your little \u201cclever\u201d comment, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn\u2019t, you goddamn idiot.",

Saved me by being the only light in my teenage darkness of abuse, one of the things that helped me go on. But the day I heard he died my heart shattered, I would never get to meet him and tell him. \n\nBut.... I already did in a way. He knew. He knew from all the others who met him and who thanked him on my behalf. He knew he was loved, appreciated, and that so many others cared for him.

Again, a pronoun is just a tool to use so you're not saying: \"God went to the mall so God could get God some popcorn because God loves to eat popcorn when God's friends come over to watch God's favourite movie.\"\n\n[The pronoun you're looking for is \"it.\"](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/it)\n\nEDIT: If you're going to make this claim (and then block me), why not take it to it's logical conclusion. If a pronoun cannot be used on something that is \"incomprehensible\" and \"abstract,\" then why are we allowed to use nouns? A pronoun literally just replaces a noun to make speaking and writing less tedious. \n\nSo now how do we refer to God if we want to talk about it? We just say \\_\\_\\_ instead of \\_\\_\\_. Would that work? When speaking, you just pause briefly instead of saying it?",

All it points out is that the original *noun* used to describe the holy spirit is female but only because of languages having genderized nouns. That really doesn\u2019t make good rationale for the holy spirit being female. \n\nThe word for \u201cthe table\u201d in German is \u201cder Tisch\u201d, a masculine noun. But you don\u2019t see German people telling you that because of this, tables somehow embody some kind of masculine essence.\n\nIf god and the holy spirit exist they ain\u2019t male or female. Isn\u2019t the whole point that they existed before male and female was a thing? And that they literally created the genders originally? The only logical conclusion is that god is genderless. \n\n^(Apart from Jesus perhaps but that\u2019s where the trinity gets more confusing with various factions debating whether or not Jesus was a man before he was born as a human and whether he still was after he ascended.)",

Gods in almost if not all cultures have assigned genders, which is a natural part of story telling. Much like how Zeus is a male and Athena is a female, Yahweh is a male. Yahweh initially is tied to Canaanite deities although it should be noted there is some debate on which pantheon he initially belongs to. The Canaanites did not worship one true god but rather a larger pantheon of which there were male and female gods and over time Yahweh took on the lore and traits of others (particularly El) before becoming Monotheistic.\n\nIf you're wondering how something that exists as a cosmic entity seemingly beyond human comprehension can possibly have a gender it's because it's not beyond human comprehension. How can it be when it is humans that create these stories? And as with almost every story we weave we give the characters assigned genders.",

It's the same as when you capitalize, or don't capitalize, the word \"mom\":\n\n>I'm going to visit Mom tonight.\n\n>I'm going to visit his mom tonight.\n\nThe difference in capitalization is simply a matter of the first \"mom\" being used as a name for a specific person while the second \"mom\" is being used as a descriptor of somebody's identity.  In the same way, \"God is a god.\"  The word \"god\" shows up twice in that sentence, but it has two different meanings and one of them requires capitalization.",

The difference between God Abrahamic and them is that God Abrahamic is *named* God. He has separate names, sure and those are used interchangeably in reference to him, but his primary name is God.\n\nI\u2019m genuinely not sure how it\u2019s disrespectful towards non-Abrahamic religions to not capitalize God, when they themselves don\u2019t. Religions like Odinani and that of the OvaHimba don\u2019t, so they have actual names for their own gods.  \n\nTo be honest with you this seems like a half-assed dig at the original commenter, and one that falls apart when you hold even a little logic to it.",

              "text": "Different Christian groups have different beliefs about the exact nature of God, but as far as I've seen, the most common belief is that God does not have a physical body, or at least not in the same way that people have physical bodies. Now, that is just the belief of the denomination, but that doesn't necessarily mean that each person within a Christian denomination understands all of the beliefs which their denomination holds, but that's a different topic.\n\nAnyways, for most Christian groups, it's not so much that they think \"He/Him\" are the proper pronouns to use for God because they think it matches his genitalia, but more because it matches his role in society. The Bible was written in a highly patriarchal society, and God was supposedly the supreme patriarch over all of his followers, therefore it made the most sense to call him the \"Father\". Furthermore, women were more like incubators for them because they often said that the baby \"came\" from the Father's loins, and therefore it made more sense to have a father creator of the universe than a mother creator. \n\nSome people still have this misconception. They think that the sperm gets inside an egg and then the sperm forms into a baby. This is actually not really correct. A zygote is not a sperm growing in an egg inside its mother, a zygote is a genetic combination of the sperm and egg. The egg adds as much genetics to the forming baby as the sperm. It's not just an empty shell waiting to be filled. Actually, they're not really shells at all. (this misunderstanding may also be partly a misunderstanding on how eggs work with birds which really do have hard-shelled eggs. Those are not naturally \"empty\" without male insemination either, but I'm getting off topic again.)\n\nAlso, modern society is much less patriarchal so we don't always need to have a man in a position of authority. We can argue all day about *exactly* how much less patriarchal society is and how much more progress remains to be made, but I think that it's hard to deny that progress has been made over the last few centuries. These facts have led some to believe that perhaps in modern society, we no longer need to have all male pronouns and masculine words referring to god. There are some more liberal branches and denominations of Christianity which no longer require that God should always be referred to as a \"He\", but obviously the most conservative ones remain very adamant that God should always be referred to as a male, and they reject any new translations of the Bible which attempt to change the pronouns.",

The mother of her so-called child is not the parent, but she only nurtures the newly sown embryo. The male who mounts is the one who generates the child, whereas she, like a host for a guest, provides nurture for the seedling, so that divine power does not harm it. And I will offer you a sure proof of this argument: a father can exist without a mother. A witness is here at hand, the child of Olympian Zeus, who was not nurtured in the darkness of a womb, and she is such a seedling as no goddess could produce.\n\nIt's a fictional scenario, but it's from a serious play and the logic would track to the Athenian audience.",

These translations are trying to find a way to relay when 'men' means specifically a group entirely of men and when it means generically \"people\". \n\nFor example, look at the range of translation for *benei Israel* in [Leviticus 1:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Leviticus%201:2), which literally means 'sons of Israel':\n\n* Speak to the Israelites and tell them . . .\n\n* the children of Israel\n\n* the people of Israel\n\nThere are some instances of *bnei Israel* where it is clear they are talking about the community as a whole and some where it is clear they are only talking about the men. The Hebrew could go either way, so I think it is up to the translator to discern which is more appropriate.",

Static translates the words with little notice to the language differences in things like grammar and usage which means it's more true to the original but less easily understood. The love translation take the meaning of the original and returns an easily understandable version in the other language. This makes it far more influenced by the translators understanding or opinion of the original or what they are trying to provide to the targeted audience.\n\nI'll say it's always worth looking at different translations.

The early Hebrews were not monotheistic in our modern sense, they appear to have been henotheistic (holding yhwh above the others), and God addresses a council of heavenly hosts on multiple occasions in the Hebrew bible.

The traditional biblical narrative states that periodic and regular \"straying\" from the monotheistic orthodoxy existed among the Hebrews until the return from the Babylonian exile.",

It\u2019s essentially a story of God revealing himself to be the true God. The prophets of Baal called on their god, Baal, but received no answer. And when Elijah called upon God, there was an immediate display of power.\n\nGod had to acknowledge their idea of a god, a false god, so that he could show the truth or who the real God is. Like in a discussion: you have to acknowledge a false or incorrect argument so that you can talk about it, break it down, and show why it\u2019s not correct, to ultimately reach the truth.",

He didn\u2019t even coin more words than anyone else, there are some poets who beat his record. His contribution had more to do with legitimizing writing in the existing vernacular in newspapers and the like, instead of the more common use of writing in established clich\u00e9s with a limited set of set expressions.\n\nSource: \u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea \u05e9\u05e4\u05d4 \u05de\u05d3\u05d5\u05d1\u05e8\u05ea by Shlomo Haramati",

Creating a unified identity. \nAdditionally we know that the wording in the earliest books of the OT don\u2019t necessarily say that other gods don\u2019t exists, just that the one god is above them(possibly hinting towards being okay with the polytheistic tendencies of the time)\n\nAfterwards, well I mentioned that above, that Judaism would turn to pure monotheism. \n\nNow the Abraham thing is way way older(according to the biblical interpretation) so almost irrelevant to this story",

But that's just my personal belief, you must find your own truth and live in it. But yeah obviously the bible talks about other \"gods\". God has a council of angels for sure. Some decided to fall and those are what you call these false \"gods\" which think they like God. But the angels who do God's will don't desire worship, they praise God. \n\nThat's why the true and living God wanted the Israelites to completely destroy the people in living in the promised land, because he knew the Israelites were stubborn and would turn to other idols. They didn't listen and it brought hardship, they also intermarried with the local inhabitants so I can see how that can interpreted as already living there. \n\nAbraham's own nephew Lot had decedents in the promised land the Moabites and the Ammonites, so you can have similar looking people living in the land. Also Jacob's brother Esau, which married two cannanites. But see the Bible is not only a book about humans vs humans during the conquering periods but a spiritual battle, so it's bigger than just the people living in the land (Joshua 5:13-15)",

You can believe how ever much you want, that being said, some of my favorite biblical questions. Are the kind of question that try to relate what was going on in th me OT to the outside world. Because especially the end of it has a lot of things historically correct. \nMainly the ending of Judah, Babylonian conquest, the return from exile, the fall of Judah, the fall of the kingdoms of Israel\u2026.. these are verifiably true. And it gets a lot more interesting when you compare evidence from the region of the same events. \n\nRegarding the whole beginning of genesis, well\u2026 most Jews see it as allegorical anyways.",

The outrage de jour is currently the existence of trans people and their usage of pronouns (usage of the singular they being a particularly aggravating one for conservatives). Some people have also taken to listing the pronouns they use on their social medias to help people not misidentify them. This has also upset American conservatives. \n\nNow, a subset of the American conservatives are...lacking in critical thought. They have become so entrenched in their bigotry and so empowered in their stupidity that they think pronouns as a concept do not exist. Like the person in this tweet. \n\nI can go into how American conservatives also struggle with the difference between biological sex and gender, but that's a whole 'nother bag of worms. \n\nTL;DR: American conservatives embrace anti-intellectualism to justify and support their bigotry.",

They usually ignore suffixes, as in [the verse just above](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.27?lang=bi&lookup=%D7%91%D6%BC%D6%B0%D7%A6%D6%B7%D7%9C%D6%B0%D7%9E%D6%94%D7%95%D6%B9&with=Lexicon&lang2=en), the \u05d1\u05e6\u05dc\u05de\u05d5 is just translated as that \u05e6\u05dc\u05dd core, without the \u05d1\u05be prefix and the \u05be\u05d5 suffix.\n\nAnd you can refresh your Hebrew with these [Aleph with Beth](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLq1vmb-z7PpQt2PDNUr7XOzBjWAOWf0Rt) lessons on YouTube :)",
