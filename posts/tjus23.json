They lasted even well up into the Roman imperial period. The reason their power declined is largely of their inheritance laws. When men died their property passed to their wife (some in trust for their children, but most as property in her own right), and men died a \\*lot\\* so there was huge capital accumulation among the women of sparta.\n\nThis effectively made a few extremely wealthy women kingmakers, but they didn't have the military experience (or personal stake) to be making those decisions so they eventually gambled too hard and lost everything.\n\nAfter that, Sparta kept trundling along for quite a few centuries but they never regained their former power.",

Or even a problem until it was too late. By the time it was causing issues the only way to fix it would have been for the matriarchs to vote against themselves, which wasn't going to happen.\n\n> and the number of full citizens kept falling over time.\n\nThat only happened after their fall from power though. Prior to that their population had been continually increasing. They even had a colony in Taranto.\n\n> Also the mesenian helots remained rebellious untir their liberation which forced Sparta to dedicate lots of energies to watch them out\n\nArguably not a weakness. It's not a social model I'd advocate but being perpetually at war with their own slaves kept them sharp. I think it's probably most comparable to the bolshevik concept of perpetual revolution.\n\n> By all accounts Sparta was always very careful in their foreign policy. Not much gambling\n\nThey *were* back when the decisions were being made by the guys who would be on the front lines enforcing them. The problems started to happen when women became the power behind the throne and were in a position to pick ephors.",

That's why they had publicly assigned lots of land, so much emphasis in communal dinners, was strictly forbidden any ostentation of wealth and didn't have any proper coinage\n\nIn which moments did these women maede rash decisions?\n\n1.

Waste of time, but here you go.\n\n> That article is kinda relying on a touchy feely postmodern viewpoint to make sense. \n\nMy initial comment was aimed at that in which you're basically defending it. postmodern touchy feely viewpoint = \"it's bad by our standards\"  \n\n> We're supposed to believe that they were mentally weak and fragile because of all the harsh training they went through as a child\n\n\"magically weak\" and \"fragile\" is that what you call normal humans? Tell me one part of their training (except the murder part) where a human would be able to survive without any trouble, especially when malnourished. The story by Xeno something is told to be from Spartans so it suffers from survivorship bias, the dead spartans couldn't tell him how bad it was.  \n\n> , but the record of their successes says otherwise.  \n\nYou speak as if \"record of their successes\" is significant. Keep on reading, it's not.\n\n> the only degenerate accusation in there was pederasty, and tbh that was just the standard insult at the time.  \n\nExcept it wasn't meant as an insult here but an act they participated in.  \n\n>  No matter what greek society you'll read about there'll be some other greek calling them a bunch of boyfuckers, but the fact that that was an insult at all puts lie to the claim it was perfectly normal.  \n\n~~So the fact that pedophilia was considered normal then debunks all of this? Whoa..~~  \nGot this part wrong. The \"boyfucker\" was an insult because getting penetrated was considered shameful, and even then, that was in the time when the Romans were a thing and maybe slightly before that as you can tell in the [wikipage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pederasty) you probably read that from.. Spartans were basically a used condom by then, they were nothing, so what you said doesn't apply.  \n\n>  Also all greek societies we know of had far harsher laws against it than we do. Nowadays men who get caught fucking boys often get probation, back then they'd be executed. \n\n[Wait what?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pederasty)  \n\n> Hell, even teaching kids ideas seen as evil could get you executed.  \n\nWith that, I'm guessing you're trolling or just making shit up.\n\n> You seem to be awfully obsessed with that movie though...  \n\nTIL saying \"That movie is really good\" is obsession",
