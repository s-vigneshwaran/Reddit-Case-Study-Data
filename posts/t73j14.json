If you say a crazy idea like this to someone in person, you might get weird looks, some uncomfortable \u201cHuh\u201ds, and a slow retreat of the person away from you. Only every once in awhile might you find a relatively like-minded crazy person receptive to the idea. The spread of radical fringe ideas happens relatively slowly via word-of-mouth. People may still spread crazy, conspiratorial gossip, but these are still things within the realm of possibility. Crazy fringe ideas are completely out there with almost no basis in reality.\n\nThen the internet comes along and suddenly you can spread your ideas to potentially millions of people at a time, millions of people likely spending large parts of their life isolated socially, looking at computer screens, and the ideas spread faster, until you have a community of 1000 toaster fuckers.",
