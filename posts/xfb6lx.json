I can't fathom how anyone could tolerate being in the same room with him for more than a few minutes, without at least calling him out constantly for being a jackass and pretending that the vomit he spews from his mouth incessantly is somehow relevant or socially acceptable.  He's some bizarre master of \"I'll piss on your feet and tell you it's raining, and because I'm entitled to my alternate facts about what's piss and what's rain, you have to accept me.\"",
