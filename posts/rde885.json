How entirely at ease he feels as a result. How futile and frivolous discussions about the rights of the Jew appear to him. He has placed himself on other ground from the beginning. If out of courtesy he consents for a moment to defend his point of view, he lends himself but does not give himself. He tries simply to project his intuitive certainty onto the plane of discourse. I mentioned awhile back some remarks by anti\u2010Semites, all of them absurd: \"I hate Jews because they make servants insubordinate, because a Jewish furrier robbed me, etc.\" Never believe that anti\u2010 Semites are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies. They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti\u2010Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past. It is not that they are afraid of being convinced. They fear only to appear ridiculous or to prejudice by their embarrassment their hope of winning over some third person to their side.\u201c",

Often they spin their \"\"\"cancelation\"\"\" into a whole new super-grifty phase of their career. Like Jimmy Fallon was on the list. _JIMMY FUCKING FALLON._ Aka **LITERALLY THE HOST OF _THE_ MOTHERFUCKING _TONIGHT SHOW_ - aka, **LITERALLY _THE_ LATE NITE TALK SHOW, THE SHOW WHERE THE WHOLE ENTIRE FORMAT OF LATE NITE THAT LENO, LETTERMAN, CONAN, COLBERT, KIMMEL, FERGUSON, MEYERS, CORDEN, ET ALL HAVE USED AS A TEMPLATE LITERALLY FROM DAY ONE** - _that_ guy is supposed to be \"\"\"\"canceled\"\"\" then?! Yeah. Ok. For sure. Oll korrekt, m'lud.\n\n(Side note: \"Oll Korrekt\" is literally what \"O.K.\" stands for. It came about in the late 1800s - aka the lateen-hundreds - or the early 1900s, when snooty rich bitches like that scum-guzzler that The New Yorker uses as a pseudo-mascot decided a fun way to make fun of the stupid and uneducated poors was to jokingly misspell the then-commonly used phrase \"All Correct\" - which obv was used in the same way we use \"OK\" now - as \"Oll Korrekt\" cuz \"lol that's probably how dumb-bumb poor-o's think All Correct is spelt! Haw! Haw! Guffaw!\" and then eventually started writing \"O.K.\" for short and then it eventually trickled down into generic nomenclature across all demographics.)",

I guess you would be surprised to learn that there are many top scientists who oppose the government imposing a covid19 vaccine passport? Having libertarian views on curbing the extent of the government's powers doesnt suddenly make someone science illiterate or anti vax; that is a blanket sentiment almost straight out of a propaganda handbook. Right now, in the UK at least, we have enough voluntary vaccinations that implementing a mandate will have little practical difference on the epidemic, but sets a huge precedent for the government to introduce future draconian measures - ones that may not even be concerned with vaccination or covid, all under a pretense of \"greater good\".",

Either you didn't read it, or you did and decided you still had a valid opinion despite what is now self admitted ignorance? Have I got that right?\n\nI don't live in the US but from what I know from relatives and friends the \"MMR mandate\" is just a strong recommendation from the CDC. Now maybe individual states have laws based on that recommendation but this is still a far cry from a government issued passport. Care to explain further?",

They are opposed only be a fringe group of scientifically illiterate banshees who use exactly the same fraudulent arguments against them that people are now using against mandates for COVID vaccines. They regurgitate the same breathless nonsense about personal freedom, when in fact those mandates are simply a codification of sound epidemiological practice, and of the personal responsibility towards one's fellow citizen one should exhibit. Alas, anti-vaxxers/madaters have chosen selfish reckless endangerment of everyone around them instead. Here's a UK centric analogy for you: they are like the people who refused to participate in the wartime blackout regulations of 1939, on the basis of claims that it imposed on their personal freedom. In so doing, they endangered both themselves, and their countrymen. It's the same complete lack of personal responsibility, and lack of accountability.",

No meaningful correlation/causation can be drawn from a sample size that small because, at random, any given individual may have a different reaction than another individual. However, when you zoom out and look at the entire data set (millions of those data points), the trend is clear. People who are vaccinated have a lower chance of getting sick and if they do get sick, it is less severe and fewer hospitalizations, while people who are not vaccinated show an increased risk of hospitalizations and now make up the overwhelming majority of people who are still dying of Covid.\n\nThe risk of actual complications as a direct result of being vaccinated is *extremely low*. Like, so low that it is a negligible statistical anomaly compared to the benefit of the population being vaccinated. You have a much higher chance of catching covid and getting sick (or spreading it to others) without a vaccine than the chance that you experience any complications from the vaccine (let alone deadly complications).",

                      "text": "The seatbelt syndrome refers to an umbrella term used to refer to a variety of injuries caused by seatbelts to car occupants during motor vehicle accidents. The seatbelt syndrome encompasses a seatbelt sign on the chest or the abdominal wall, a fracture of the lumbar section of the spine and perforation of a hollow viscus. Incorrect use of seatbelts in adults has been associated with seatbelt syndrome although it has been demonstrated that the paediatric population is affected most. Lapbelts usually cause abdominal, pelvic or spinal injuries. In addition to abdominopelvic and spinal injuries, the three-point belt is associated with injuries of the chest, the heart, lungs, the brachial plexus of nerves and major blood vessels. When a seatbelt sign occurs on the abdominal wall, abdominal organs might be injured. In spite of poor outcomes being associated with improper use of seatbelts, it is generally accepted that proper use of seatbelts is effective in reducing fatalities.\n\n\nDespite all these risks, I bet you still buckle up every time since you know the benefits outweigh the risks.",

Unless you can find some new biological mechanism that we entirely missed for decades, new processes starting up from nothing because of a substance that isn\u2019t there is about as believable as crystal healing.\n\nTen years is the kind of scale we use for liposoluble substances, pollutants that bind to DNA, or stuff that sticks to internal tissue - it stays there for years, and then eventually has an effect *while still in the body, or 1-2 months after*. It\u2019s a clear causal link. We don\u2019t have any of that in here.\n\nAlso, just so you know, RNA isn\u2019t something that sticks around.

In addition to that that's definitely on me for mistaking the longevity of RNA.\n\nI live in an unfortunately conservative state, and my family eats this shit up; I generally just maintain my distance, but I think I've removed myself from some of these discussions for so long that I've absorbed a talking point or two without realizing I wasn't properly informed anymore.\n\nWhich is a long-winded way of saying **I am sorry for the misinformation**. I'm going to edit my comment with appropriate strikethroughs.\n\nThat being said, it is a comparatively experimental  method, and I think it's important to acknowledge that with anyone you debate so your opponent doesn't have the opportunity to challenge you on it. And they feel like you're willing to discuss with them, which makes them a little more receptive. In my experience, a lot of the immediate division occurs because someone conflates the mRNA vaccine with a typical flu vaccine and a skeptic will immediately see it as disingenuous.

Unfortunately I can\u2019t access it, but I found her statement from March on another site which was quickly rescinded by the CDC, as it was during the early trials and based on a small population pool. Furthermore, I tried searching for any other (legit) statements post-March and can\u2019t find anything. So basically anti-vaxxers are arguing against one claim/source which was quickly & publicly rescinded by the rest of the CDC (including Fauci) and ignoring the hundreds if not thousands of sources saying otherwise since March for the sake of an argument. \n\nWhile I can argue that it was dumb as hell to make such a statement, even if it was truly based on the evidence at hand, it\u2019s also dumb as hell to keep peddling your argument as if most of us don\u2019t know that the vaccine is not a cure or completely prevents transmission. Again, this is not news to most of us. Thanks for finding that source and answering my question anyways.",

              "text": "I think you've got it backwards.\n\nCritical thinking isn't taught in education. This--all of this--is our result for that. If we want a smarter society who is capable of rationally judging logic, then we aren't going to magically get that by teaching them algebra and how to diagram sentences, as we do currently (and somehow expect to be sufficient). We need to teach people how to think critically *so that they're able to think critically.*\n\nObviously you can't make everyone a critical thinker by teaching them such a curriculum. But, if we did, then statistically speaking, way more people would at least be able to think better. We could only be better off.\n\nPersonally, I don't see how anyone could be surprised that so many people can't think critically when they aren't taught how to think critically. Critical thinking doesn't inherently rise from a vacuum. But, I *would* be surprised if we found ourselves in the same state of affairs if we lived in a society where the population has all learned as much about Critical thinking throughout K-12 as they have math, language, and history. Only then would I throw my hands up and say, \"alright, I'm at a loss. I don't know what to do about this.\" But we're not there. We're not even close. For all we know, *that's* the cause (or one of the causes) for this problem in the first place.\n\nTechnically, your logic is like saying--in a world where math isn't taught in school--\"hey, these people can't solve an algebraic equation... We'd have more luck teaching a horse about Rome than we would by teaching these people math!\" Do you see that teaching them math would actually be the solution? You can't know what you don't know. Hence why we have education in the first place.\n\nThe problem is that we still have a lot of room for fundamental reform in education (e.g. philosophy and psychology both need to be their own core curricula throughout K-12, kids need personalized learning instead of dumping 30 random kids into a class and expecting them to all learn in the same way at the same rate, etc.). The other problem is that such reform isn't happening quickly enough.",

So either the vaccine reduces the severity of the illness to some extent, or it reduces your chance of contracting the illness itself, or both.

As the biggest benefit of masks is public/community control, if you are unwittingly infected, having the mask on massively decreases the range of the particles that may contain virus.  I wear a mask for myself, but it also lets others around me know that I'm actively trying to not accidentally get them sick.  I don't know what the condition of those around me is, maybe they're immunocompromised, maybe they have a condition that prevents them from getting a vaccine, maybe they're just one of those people who if they caught covid, they'd end up in the hospital anyway out of random chance?  Why take the risk of injuring someone else because I'm lazy and selfish?  It's minimally invasive for me to wear a mask and it means that I'm a lower risk to everyone around me, so I do it because I have respect for life.",

But they could still have covid, and that can be harmful to them and others, like driving drunk. The solution is not allow drunk driving, even if you wear a seat belt. Unfortunately the vaccine makes people into the person who has 8 drinks and wants to drive home.",

It\u2019s something about our nature as a species I\u2019m guessing.  Like once you belong to a certain tribe, you see yourself as a part of something.  I don\u2019t know, I definitely could be wrong about that, it\u2019s just an example and the best I have at the moment.  Honestly, I was super against it and never expected I would change. \n\nThere were lots of reasons I changed my mind.  I wrote a list of why I would and wouldn\u2019t and the list for why I would was much heavier leaning towards caring about others and the list for not looked heavily self concerned.  I pulled reasons from the internet, friends, family on both sides of the argument and realized this is a personal and social responsibility to protect those around me with the only protection available.  There is no proven treatment or proactive approach ( thought there was but a higher level view of those websites and videos show them to be very much conspiracy heavy).  \n\nAlso, I became weary of the world as it is. I hate this divide among us.  It\u2019s cause families I break up, riots, and more hate and anger than I\u2019ve ever seen in my life.  We have to move away from this, I have loved ones that I want to live in a world as close to happy and healthy as it can be.   \n\nSo I got vaccinated and also I want it be nicer.",

I am arguing that someone should be a terrible person(just like going out when your sick) but let's be honest, there are a lot of people who aren't good people.  Using the same logic as this vaccine card you would want everyone to carry a card saying they don't have aids, hepititis or herpes.\n\n\\>Did I miss anything or is herpes transmitted by food now?\n\nHepatitis transmits through fecal matter from infected person.  If they are cooking your food and don't wash their hands well they could pass it to you.  Should everyone who makes food have a card that says they are hepatitis free?\n\n\\>You should disclose relevant information. For example, when you enroll to school your parents will have to tell them if you had been vaccinated against certain diseases.\n\nNot true in every state.  I constantly hear this but this doesn't apply to every where and some schools don't require any vaccinations.\n\n\\>Is this your first time finding out all this?\n\nI have to be completely honest, you didn't teach me anything through your post.  I wish you did, that is why I post in a subreddit that I know I will get blasted on.  I love debating.  I am not always right but I enjoy hearing other people's opinions.",

Drawing straws has a different meaning.\n\nAnd more importantly, your entire schtick is:\n\n> *just because someone negatively affects you doesn't mean you should discriminate against them*\n\nYou gave your examples of herpes and hepatitis users. I counter with the reply that yes, we **do** actually discriminate against those people, too, in the relevant settings. And likewise, people who drive while drunk also negatively affect me, and we discriminate against them.\n\nFor someone who loves debating, you sure are surprised to read about counter-examples.\n\n> So your willing to trust that people will wash their hands when making your food but don't trust that a person won't go to a public place while they are sick?\n\nYes.\n\nDo you watch the news **at all**? \n\n> So if someone has already fully recovered from covid and can prove it, but is unvaccinated, are they still a plague rat to you?\n\nAlso yes.",

Again big difference.\n\nThat is forcing people to get vaccinated. The government is telling private businesses who they can and cannot serve and telling people unless they get the vaccine you can\u2019t shop at any private business. If you don\u2019t think that\u2019s forcing people then idk what to tell you",

You do have a right to medical care and food, which is why (at least where I\u2019m from) supermarkets are still accepting non-vaccinated/no vaccine passport people. You don\u2019t automatically have a right to have brunch at a cafe. That is a privilege. You don\u2019t see people defend prisoners saying that we are \u201csegregating\u201d them. They aren\u2019t forcing people to take a vaccine. But it\u2019s your choices that have consequences, that being you getting privileges, not rights, taken away. \n\nWhen you don\u2019t get vaccinated, it\u2019s not just a personal choice, it\u2019s a choice that affects others. Those that aren\u2019t vaccinated are more likely to spread, not saying if you are you can\u2019t but you are less likely to. Unvaccinated are also more likely to cause mutations in the virus. That\u2019s how omicron came about. COVID-19 became rampant in South Africa, one of the lowest vaccinated places, and it mutated to omicron. The more it mutates the more difficult it is to control with vaccines. We don\u2019t want the virus to mutate because the current vaccinations may not be effective against it.\n\nThe vaccination also isn\u2019t just to stop spreading or not get sick. It\u2019s to prevent healthcare systems to become overrun. Many hospitals in America when the virus first arrived were overrun and could not handle the amount of patients coming in, I highly recommend watching the documentary on Disney+ \u201cthe first wave\u201d it goes in depth on the first wave of COVID in New York. Unvaccinated are more likely to get sick which means they are more likely to go to hospital and block those who need care for cancer treatments, surgeries and other high importance cases from receiving the care they need. Where I live the public hospital only has 20 icu beds, which at any given time 18 are occupied, if COVID got to where I live (it isn\u2019t here right now), there are only 2 beds available for those who need the care. That means if anything else happens, like a bus crashes and several people are injured badly, they may not be able to get the best care they need. It\u2019s ignorant to just say \u201cwhy should I get the vaccine, if you have it you can still spread it\u201d when if you get COVID and go into hospital, you are preventing another person that needs care for something that isn\u2019t preventable from receiving care. If you or a friend/family member had a heart attack and go to the ED but can\u2019t get good or urgent care because of unvaccinated people taking up precious beds and resources, you will understand the need for vaccine mandates. \n\nThis is a community effort that isn\u2019t about any single person. The only way we can get back to normal is by getting the vaccine. You may not like the mandates but to lower the spread of the virus among unvaccinated, and prevent stress on healthcare systems, it is required.",

They\u2019re dodging it, and saying \u201cI don\u2019t care if this drags into the next decade.\u201d\n\nOne thing is very certain. There will be other pandemics, it\u2019s not if but *when*. Sure as the sun rises, we\u2019ll see an Ebola or a SARS-27 or a MERS-31 or a Covid-34.

How bout 40 million?\n\nWe had the bubonic plague once. It killed 200 million.

Most laws are not made for informed, sane folk. I don't need the government to tell me to wear a helmet or buckle up, cause I am not a complete idiot. Just like this mandate isn't for me, I got vaxxinated and I feel little sympathy for those who haven't. It's free and widely available, if you haven't gotten it is likely A)un informed/educated and scared of the unknown or B) cause ma politics. Personally neither seems like good excuses. \n\nAnd for those who CANT get it because they have actual medical reasons, that's easy enough to prove so not seeing a big issue there either.

That is what it boils down to. The goverment should, as it has, recommend for people to get vaccinated. The goverment also has the right to demand vaccine mandates on federal property, but when it comes to digital identities this boils down to is what level of privacy we respect for citizens and where we draw the line between private property and goverment property. Forcing people to choose one way or another is a road leading to goverment abuse and loss of personal liberties time and time again. Direct goverment oversight through the collection of customer data on private property is in effect the expansion of goverment property and diminishment of rights to private property and businesses",

And who puts those guidelines in place? The same people that completely bungled the beginning of the pandemic. The people who downplayed the situation because they didn't want to affect the economy. The same people who told us we shouldn't wear masks only to turn around and tell us we are forbidden to walk inside without one a few months later. The fact that governments are still using the number of cases per day as a metric to base their decisions on tells you everything you need to know about how competent they actually are. They are actively encouraging the fear mongering in the media. \n\nWhen the vaccines came out they told us we should get vaccinated and instead of reassuring anyone who had doubts about the vaccine they started calling them idiots. That's the best way to get the most people vaccinated right? If you tell people they're idiots surely they will come over to your side, right? \n\nGovernments have no fucking clue what they're doing, but we should blindly listen to them because \"it'll end the pandemic faster\". The pandemic is over. It's endemic now. New variants are only going to be less lethal. Omicron hasn't killed a single person yet. \n\nBut no, we should still be quaking in our boots because believing in vaccines apoarently equals not believing in their effectiveness.",

Vaccines have been required for a litany of things ranging from travel to schooling to certain occupations. \n\nThere are private schools that have required vaccines for their students for a long time. That is a private enterprise requiring medical information to purchase their services. \n\nThis is not a precedent setting policy.",

I have an acquaintance, who is really anti-VAX. His wife isn't, she is vaccinated and can move around freely. He can't go the the restaurant, movies, theatrical plays and friends (including ours) and relatives' residences with her (they have advised him not to come) So, no XMas or New Year receptions, no holiday travels to warmer climates (live in a winter province of Canada) because you need vaccination proof for airplane travel. To me it doesn't make any sense, cutting you off from social interaction. These people don't even realize that if they didn't get Polio and other diseases, it is because they were vaccinated !Hey, waatdoino ?",

If you say yes youre hopeless and clearly can't think for yourself and need to be told what to do by a bunch of old white dudes, OR you think they shouldn't and therefore you can't apply a rule to someone's private business. \n\nIt's so simple and yet people just bend over begging for the government to feed them a little more of that cold hard bullshit. \n\nTo add to this disaster people literally believe that the covid vaccine would create some kind of herd immunity LOL. Unless everyone on planet Earth got vaccinated at the same exact time and then again at the same time 21 days later with a booster 4 to 5 months out FOREVER, we will always have covid floating around, and it's not going to matter if someone is vaccinated or not.\n\nI don't care about the votes on Reddit so go ahead and downvote all you want people, but honestly it's just people who have no rebuttal who downvote and move along.

Edge cases don't really matter when it comes to the HUGE number of lives saved.  Even if you think those edge cases might apply to you, you'll still get fined if the government catches you without a seatbelt on.\n\nStatistics don't care about your feelings on a safety measure, whether that's a helmet, a seatbelt, or a vaccine.",

Sure, a majority of the Trumpers in my life are very vocally unvaccinated.  However, it's something like 70% of young African Americans who aren't vaccinated either.\n\nYou could argue it could be a funding/availability problem for predominantly black areas, but that wouldn't be the entire reason either.  A buddy of mine who's black won't get it because historically the government hasn't been kind to African Americans.  He'll talk about the Tuskegee Experiments and other scenarios where blacks always got screwed over.\n\nHe said he'll get it in a few years.  He only votes Democrat.",

Also, if you really feel that way then why the fuck did you get vaccinated? That makes no sense. \n\nThis is exactly why I think people who argue \"I'm vaccinated but don't agree with mandates\" are completely illogical.\n\n>I'm not even arguing that they are unsafe, just why I understand people's concerns. I am vaccinated. By choice. No mandate.\n\nThese are contradictory statements. You don't think the vaccine is unsafe, yet you understand why some people believe them to be. That just sounds like you're perfectly okay with allowing ignorance to fester, which is probably a worse pandemic than covid.\n\n>Peanut butter is safe, but if you give it to the whole country it wouldn't be good for some.\n\nThe only reason why peanut butter is unsafe for some is because of allergies. Any vaccine mandate would clearly have an exception for those with allergies to the contents in the vaccine.\n\nAlso, peanut butter can't save someone's life.\n\nDo you feel this same way about all the other vaccine mandates we already have?\n\n>It just seems crazy to make someone do something they see as a risk to their health/life.\n\nIt seems even crazier to me that we would freely allow ignorance to spread unchecked.\n\nAt this point the majority of people still refusing the vaccine aren't doing it because they think it's unsafe (every single research paper on the matter proves that it is safe). Instead, they refuse it on the basis of \"I don't like being told what to do\".\n\nThat's not a respectable argument and we shouldn't have to capitulate to their ignorant, selfish whims.",

That's why I understand people's hesitancy.\n\nMillions of people have taken it with very minimal side effects. It's been available for about a year now. Just like flu vaccines, these covid ones don't last in your system for much longer than that, it's why their effectiveness wanes.\n\nPeople who are skeptical of long-term effects from the covid vaccines just are ignorant to how they work and we shouldn't be holding up our entire society because they refuse to get educated on the subject.\n\n>It is not illogical to be vaccinated, but understand why others would be hesitant.\n\nIt absolutely is if you understand how these vaccines work.\n\n>Taking a new pharmaceutical is always a risk\n\nSure which is why I understood the hesitancy for the first few months. Now it's beyond the point where any major side effects would have popped up, which changes things.\n\n>I'm a cancer survivor, so got the vaccine no question. However, I can understand why some may think it's an unnecessary risk.\n\nNow this is just doublely blowing me away. You of all people should want everyone around you to be vaccinated.\n\nRegardless though, the data clearly states that you are exponentially more likely to die or be hospitalized from catching covid unvaccinated than if you were vaccinated. The risk of getting some serious side effect from the vaccines are even lower than your chances of dying from covid itself, which, just talking percentages, was already low to begin with. \n\nSo statistically it is more of an unnecessary risk to not get vaccinated. So no, I don't understand why someone chooses to not get vaccinated. It is not a choice that is rooted in logic but rather just irrational fear and ignorance.\n\nI don't respect their argument and I don't respect your stance of just allowing their ignorance to go unchecked.",

There should be. For instance businesses are required to check for age verification to sell certain products. Of course the business would make more money if they could sell beer to 14-year-olds, but regulation keeps them from being able to do that.  Good. \n\nThere is a line where it becomes overreaching though.   For instance telling a restaurant that makes a huge amount of their profits off of the sale of alcohol, that they can no longer sell alcoholic beverages at all, for public safety because alcohol related deaths exist. \n\nI believe it is overreaching to tell a business that they are not allowed to let patrons in the door without proof of vaccination, because covid related deaths exist.",

As you\u2019ve already mentioned, smokers make that choice and that choice only affects them. The secondhand smoke, however, affects others so it\u2019s much more analogous to COVID.\n\n>\tIsn't this a pandemic of the unvaccinated?\n\nI mean\u2026 I never said that but, yes, I guess it is. Except in this analogy, the secondhand smoke would have to get worse as more people smoke and would need to have the ability to continue affecting people who weren\u2019t initially affected. Even if I, as a non-smoker, can be affected by secondhand smoke, I can\u2019t further affect people by giving them secondhand smoke. With COVID, you can continue to affect people outside of the initial exposure. So, yes\u2026 COVID is still worse in that regard in terms of people making those choices related to risks.\n\nEdit to address the stuff you added:\n\nComparing vaccinated people to non-smokers doesn\u2019t work. Vaccines, by their very nature, minimize the effects of the virus. Not smoking doesn\u2019t have the same effect. We\u2019re exhausting the parallels in this analogy and straying from the point. COVID has far more risk, in a smaller frame of exposure, than any incidence of smoking or secondhand smoke. Someone who lives with a smoker may die of secondhand smoke but they will never pass that risk on to someone they have contact with in public.",

And polio vaccines are still not 100% effective. So I'd rather avoid contact even if I'm vaccinated.\n\nAnd it works if you're vaccinated. At least I won't die. I'm afraid of covid because I simply hate being sick. And I do not want to transmit it further. And a more dangerous mutation can send me to a hospital.",

Vaccines never created magic force fields that keep viruses from entering your body. They just make it so your body knows how to fight it off. This means the chances of you having symptoms are dramatically reduced, and it gets killed off a hell of a lot faster. And then when people who are both vaccinated are passing diseases back and forth to each other, neither of them are likely to get sick because they both have the vaccine that helps protect them.\n\nThis is how they have always been. It's nothing new. Stop using right wing talking points.\n\nEdit: Know what, how about we look at a great example. Right before covid and shit when the antivax movement was starting up, there were measles outbreaks. Measles. Something that died out with vaccines. Right? I mean, they couldn't get into anyone's bodies, so it probably died out. So how did it come back?\n\nBecause people still get measles. Or, at least the virus still enters the body. The vast majority of people will never have any sort of symptoms. There's a chance you have had the virus in you and passed it on. You would just never know.\n\nSo then you have a kid who isn't vaccinated, it enters their body, and it's allowed to grow... Then it gets to another unvaccinated kid. And then another. Eventually it starts really affecting people because it's not being killed off almost right away, and these kids don't have any defenses.\n\nThe disease never went away. We just destirted it before it could do anything to us. But on that small time we also could have passed it on to others.",

Anyone who told you that was wrong. \n\nDo people kind of make it sound like that in a casual conversation? Sure. But if you want to use it as an actual reason for why people don't want to get it, then it only seems reasonable to talk about how they actually work.\n\nThe virus will still exist. It always will. I mean, technically corona viruses have been around for quite some time. \n\nWhat does happen is that once you have been vaccinated, the virus will enter your body. Now, normally it takes a certain amount of time to show symptoms. IIRC when it first started it was an average of 2 weeks or so. And then it took another 2 to kill it.\n\nImagine having it killed in something closer to 3 days? You wouldn't have it long enough to have symptoms, you won't have it for the same amount of time which means less time spreading it, and because your body got onto killing it so quickly it's also weaker in a shorty time span and doesn't got stronger because it's instantly being attacked. \n\nNow, it's not a 100% guaranteed. Nothing in life is. And it gets messy when it comes to biology. There's so many different factors to take into consideration. So for the most part medication will work with the majority of the people. But there will always be a small handful where either the vaccine causes more harm, or it simply just doesn't work for them. But the chances of that are small enough that if someone has never had problems with vaccine before, they should get on this.",

              "text": "Actually, no. This isn't bubonic plague. It was never necessary to quarantine the entire population. The damage done by shutting down the economy was far worse than the damage done by the virus. If forced quarantine is necessary then it should only be for people who are confirmed or suspected to be infected. Those who are merely suspected of being infected must be quarantined in isolation from other people they haven't already been in regular contact with. You don't quarantine suspected infected people with known infected people - that just insures they will become infected if they aren't already. Yet this is precisely what governors did when they forced infected people into nursing homes to free up beds in hospitals. It is precisely what they did when they forced all passengers to quarantine on the same cruise ship. Thousands died needlessly.\n\nThis was handled poorly by national, state and local governments all over the world, including the US, especially when you consider how politically charged the population is now. Democratic leaders were highly suspicious of the vaccines when Trump announced them. Now they're demanding that everyone must receive the very same vaccines. When one political side says \"You must do this\" then it's inevitable that the opposing side is going to refuse. Now there are lunatics on both sides. There are conservatives refusing to wear masks or get vaccinated, and spouting absurd conspiracy theories, like the one that claims masks actually filter oxygen out of the air (they don't), or the one that claims vaccines alter human DNA (they don't). There are liberals claiming conservatives are murderers for refusing to be vaccinated, that literally all services, including health care, should be denied to anyone who refused to be vaccinated, and that every unvaccinated person who died from COVID would have been saved if only they had gotten the vaccine, while refusing to acknowledge the substantial percentage of those who died were fully vaccinated.\n\nThe proper way for the government to have handled every aspect of pandemic control would have been to publicly make the case for the steps they think people should take, and then advise them to take those steps. If you just ask people to do their part then most people will step up. If you order them to then many will push back. They never should have ordered businesses to close. They never should have ordered people to stay in their homes. They never should have imposed mask or vaccine mandates. Not in a free country. Freedom is too important. If the government can revoke it during an emergency then it's not a right - it's a privilege you have to ask the government for, and which they can deny. And citing cases where the government has imposed similar mandates in the past is not justification for doing it now - it's just evidence that this isn't the first time they've crossed this line.",

Young, perfectly healthy people are coming out of a COVID infection not just having lost their taste, but with food tasting like actual sewage. They're developing heart and respiratory issues that aren't going away. This nasty virus does permanent damage to healthy people.\n\nSo I understand you, taking 5 minutes out of my day to get a vaccine is not worth avoiding all of that awfulness?",

It\u2019s not hard to see the profit potential of administering new vaccines and boosters every year for infinity. I don\u2019t trust anything Pfizer or Moderna say. \n\nThere are other ways to combat the virus that nobody talks about because it doesn\u2019t make money: more ICU beds, taking vitamin supplements like vitamin D and potentially vitamin K, losing weight if you\u2019re obese or overweight, stop smoking, etc.  Also if you do get it, you can get monoclonal antibodies, merc, etc.  People talk like the vaccine is the only tool we have in our toolbox and that\u2019s just wrong. \n\nI encourage folks to think about what it means to mandate something.

She'll be locked out and that's her choice!\"\n\nI was like, \"Dad - I wouldn't think of it as locking her out, so much as locking yourself in.\"\n\nDad: \"Why?\"\n\nMe: \"She doesn't actually want to come back right now.\"\n\nNeedless to say he went out the next day and profusely apologized and they worked things out over the course of the week. I won't claim they have the happiest marriage in the world, but at least my Dad had some perspective on what he did wrong and that he was just hurting himself...
