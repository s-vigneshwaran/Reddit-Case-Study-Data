Additionally, the price of a barrel of oil this year peaked at $130/barrel.

Gas near me would be about $0.75 cheaper without tax.\n\nIIRC, the feds and many states had suspended their gas taxes in the mid to late 2000s to help make gas more affordable during the Iraq war.\n\nAlso the location of the oil in relation to the refineries is very important. As that makes it cheaper to produce gas. US drilled oil can be cheaply moved to a US refinery meaning that cheaper gas relative to the oil. Not saying that there isn't price gouging because there is no way there isnt any, but perhaps not as much extreme as we might think.",

An oil pump is a machine where you turn a handle and it pumps out dollar bills there is virtually no cost regardless of how hard your buddies in the oil industry work everyone else works hard too but we don't just get to leave the spicket on forever... We have to go back to the factory and start all over every single day rebuilding our product everyday we don't just put a pipeline in place and Let It go. So the costs are fixed they've already been spent they're not really that big of a deal look how many tapped Wells are sitting in the side of the road ready to go. Now is this a slight exaggeration you bet but when you compare it to any other product or manufacturer is an exaggeration at all? no. GM can't just put a plant in place and turn a lever and magically from the ground cars start spitting out into the parking lot. No matter how much they spend on that plant.\n\nPrices are set based upon what OPEC thinks the public can pay before we start seeing changes like the shutdown of Hummer plants like we did the last time it skyrocketed. We saw speculators take control away from the OPEC cartel at that time and OPEC got furious. they were very angry that prices were not coming down and as we all know It has nothing to do with supply or cost. \nAs a matter of fact thinks about what they want the price to be and then they set what each country is allowed to make a supply so that it looks like it's in line if not we have the negative oik price fiasco that we saw a few years ago. And that was the enemy of the oil companies an uncontrolled free market. \n\nOPEC was so angry last time it jumped out of inflation bands... that Saudi threatened CBOT to remove oil contracts if the United States did not stop speculating the price into the atmosphere. Speculators are interested in short-term profit OPEC is interested in making sure that everyone stays on gas cars forever... (as in theory they have unlimited oil supplies) and doesn't move to electric. Due to that fiasco 15 years ago... Tesla got a foothold.\n\nAll of this is ad hoc and off the cuff comments but does have some legitimacy... Just like all the other factors it's just another piece of a giant puzzle pulling on the supply and demand graph",

              "text": "Cults gonna cult.\n\nThey are 100% a cult.  This is no longer about a political candidate, a President, or anything like that.\n\nThey hit all the markers of a cult:\n\n- **1. The leader is the ultimate authority.**  You\u2019re not allowed to criticize your leader, even if the criticism is true.  He knows what's right and everything he says is reality.  Trump is never to be questioned.  \n- **2. The group suppresses skepticism.**   Critical thinking as an infectious disease that is to be suppressed.  If you question Trump, you are immediately called an enemy.\n- **3. The group de-legitimizes former members.**  Look at every person that left, or was fired from, the Trump administration.  They immediately go from \"the best people\" to liars, scumbags, crazy people, traitors, etc.  Like, it happens that very day.  Look at Barr.  The Trump cult turned on him the *very second* he said there wasn't election fraud. Also happened with Pence when he wouldn't overturn the election results, leading the cultists to call for his death.\n- **4. The group is paranoid about the outside world.**  Everything that goes wrong is \"The Deep State\" or liberals or somebody else.  Just look at COVID.  They think it's a worldwide liberal conspiracy to make Trump look bad.  They refuse to admit it's an issue even after Trump and his entire inner circle caught it.  But they also agree that China needs to be punished for it.\n- **5. The leader is above the law.**  Literally, Trump claims to be above the law.\n- **6. The group uses \u201cthought reform\u201d methods.**  They answer questions with clich\u00e9s and soundbites.  They have constant rallies to reaffirm their allegiance.  They have chants that they rely on when gathered.  \"*Lock Her Up*\", \"*Stop The count*\", etc.\n- **7. The group is elitist.** They see themselves as the enlightened, chosen, and a select organization tasked with radically transforming individual lives and the entire world.  \"Make America Great Again.\"  And only *one* person can do that...their leader.\n- **8. Willingness to perform violence on behalf of the leader.**  We have a lot of records of Trump supporters doing violence against Trump's claimed or perceived enemies.  They attempted to kidnap a sitting Governor, willing to kill anybody that got in their way (*they had a plan to fight and kill the police*) all because Trump tweeted \"Liberate Michigan\".   They threatened violence if the election wasn't overturned in his favor and actually killed people storming the Capitol.\n\nThese people can't be reasoned with.  You can't \"*bring them to our side*\" because they want \"*our side*\" dead or at least subjugated since we aren't in the cult.",

Why you may ask well that's the funny part because I was labeled as spreading covid misinformation. What misinformation was I spreading the fact that the CDC says that cloth masks don't provide any protection which they have said themselves but apparently that's considered misinformation because it doesn't toe the party line. So again we can call a spade a spade both sides of the aisle do the exact same thing at both sides of the aisle supporters do the exact same thing. No one side is better than the other all Reddit is is an echo chamber for one party to make them look like they're at the elite the best the ones that are for the people but the reality is neither of the parties are welcome to politics in 2000's",

Maybe we just don't go around telling \"uncomfortable truths\".\n\nOn blood donation: Blood is already tested for lots of things before being accepted, and could easily have been tested for HIV. But instead any man who had any contact with another man, ever, even if neither ever had any HIV exposure, was banned from donating blood. The ban on blood donation was undeniably homophobic. \n\nOkay, you've answered that one - what about race and crime statistics? I'm not optimistic about this since your profile history has a couple of low key racist dogwhistles, and an extremely anti-semitic joke that got removed from the sub it was in. But you might surprise me - go for it.",

That faction abandoned them as soon as things started going bad, and left the students to suffer the consequences on their own.\n\nWhen I was living in China one of the folks I had there had actually been at the protests.  He had been taking photos of the lead up, and ran out of film the day before it all culminated.  On that day he had several of his friends killed, and got sprayed by blood and gore from one of them who was shot right next to him.\n\nMe being a foreigner and thus no part of any of the Chinese social/government system I was considered 'safe' and kind of an escape valve for the people I made friends with in China.  They'd often find a time when no one else was around and sit down to tell me about the problems and issues they faced or were frustrated about than that they couldn't safely tell anyone else, even their own family members.\n\nThe fellow who had been at the massacre had developed the photos himself and had never let anyone see them, but one evening after dinner he sent his Chinese friends away and asked me to stay a bit longer and pulled out the box of photos he'd been holding onto and told me about his experiences that week.",

So the sub was bad.     \n        \nBut I went back a year or two later and was shocked at how much **worse** it had gotten.  It used to have a bit more of a libertarian bent, and / or more people who didn\u2019t exactly fit a political pattern, and people were allowed to disagree.  There were actually a decent number of pro choice people.  I don\u2019t remember frequently seeing just blatant open homophobia or racism.  A lot of people were openly not religious. There were a lot of conservative leaning independents who just thought Hillary and traditional politicians were corrupt and believed that Trunp was actually going to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d (lol).  Basically, if you said you loved America and werent clearly liberal, you seemed at least somewhat welcome.     \n          \nA year or two later I went back out of curiosity and holy shit.  Everybody was hardcore anti choice.  Lots of blatant racism and homophobia.  Way way less variety of thought or opinion tolerated.  Way more uniformly religious.     \n       \nI never liked the sub, and I always thought trump was shit, but the sub definitely became a much much worse and much scarier place.",

There's just this huge, macho, unbelievably aggressive and idiotic AMERICA #1 rhetoric. It's just a really simple bully mentality.\n\nAlso, people mock Americans for not knowing anything about the rest of the world, but basically everything we do know is self taught because they teach very little about anyone else. Our history classes are unbelievably boring, they're like 80% super embellished hero stories from WW2. I swear WW2 is the focus of every single history class I ever took from kindergarten to senior year. That's also why everyone in America calls everyone they don't like a \"Nazi.\" It's just constantly repackaged to us that we, the glorious Americans, defeated the villain that is the Nazis. It's presented like some sort of Marvel movie. \n\nMost people who go to college or have other exposure to different cultures grow out of it a bit, but it's easy to stay in a bubble and continuously gravitate towards things that reinforce that worldview. Our movies are the same.",

And with their shipments of weapons, vehicles etc to the Soviets, it made them better able to continue the war effort and push toward Berlin.\n\nHowever, even without the aid, many historians believe that the Soviets would have still been able to beat Germany, it just would have resulted in more years and millions of more deaths.\n\nI think this comes down to what you described which is that America is perceived as the hero of WW2 by your history books.",

Patrick O'Connor, the senior pastor at the First Presbyterian Church in Queens, and the Rev. Scott Black Johnston, the senior pastor of Manhattan's Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church, arrived to\u00a0pray with the next president.\n\n... \"I did very, very well with evangelicals in the polls,\" Trump interjected in the middle of the conversation -- previously unreported comments that were described to me by both pastors.\n\nThey gently reminded Trump that neither of them was an evangelical.\n\n\"Well, what are you then?\" Trump asked.\n\nThey explained they were mainline Protestants, the same Christian tradition in which Trump, a self-described Presbyterian, was raised and claims membership. Like many mainline pastors, they told the President-elect, they lead diverse congregations.\n\nTrump nodded along, then posed another question to the two men: \"But you're all Christians?\"\n\nYes, we're all Christians.\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nDonald\u2019s Trump unable to name one verse from \u201cfavorite book\u201d The Bible: https://youtu.be/ERUngQUCsyE\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n[Citing 'Two Corinthians,' Trump Struggles To Make The Sale To Evangelicals](https://www.npr.org/2016/01/18/463528847/citing-two-corinthians-trump-struggles-to-make-the-sale-to-evangelicals)\n\n\nThere were a few stumbles during Donald Trump's sojourn to Liberty University on Monday.\n\nHe mispronounced a book of the Bible. He cursed \u2014 twice. And on Martin Luther King Day, the GOP presidential candidate said he was honoring the slain civil-rights leader by dedicating to him the record crowds he says he drew for the school's opening convocation. (Students are required to attend.)\n\n...\n\nInstead of \u201cSecond Corinthians,\u201d as the biblical volume is correctly known, Trump remarked \u201cTwo Corinthians 3:17, that's the whole ballgame. ... Is that the one you like?\"",

That is a lot of potential economic power not being utilized.) \n\nMorality related freedoms = expend faster under democrats, except Biden.

The more inclusive a society is the more economic power it has. \n\nYou can show a clear delineation the past few years as states and certain leaders pull back from that.\n\nThe whole America first movement (that both this and the previous president have embraced) would have derailed itself years ago if people would understand the stock markets and the economy are not the same thing, nor are they motivated by the same things.",

They were not too pleased and if you notice prices hopped a bit right after and, later on OPEC opted not to increase production (political payback). So it is fiscal but it can also be the same old politics, it can also be the issues with moving the crude where it needs to go (covid did that) and the difficulties in turning it into useful fuel (industry problem) and lastly if or if not it's country of origin has trade embargoes in place (Russia and Iran).\n\nFor note I'm not even going to get into the assorted taxes placed on your average gallon of gasoline in the USA.

Instead, they are seeking supply externally from Russia/Saudia Arabia/Venezuela, other countries that mishandle their economies and wreak havoc on their people. America is now in the position of begging some of the worst world leaders today to increase supply to reduce the cost of gasoline in America. I guess funding these horrible regimes to drill for oil is preferable to drilling it in the homeland and strengthening our position on the world stage in Biden's mind.\n\nThe president may not set the gas prices but the policy the current administration is pursuing is ludicrous and most definitely impacts the price of gas.\n\nPS Charlie Kirk's tweet is idiotic.",

ExxonMobil gets what, 15% of their oil from the US? Even America's largest oil companies focus most of their resources elsewhere. Again, it's all about geology.\n\nFocusing on American oil production is dumb. Globalization has ensured that there is an aggregate global supply of oil, and aggregate global demand for oil, and global prices for oil. The US does not have a nationalized oil industry which can regulate the domestic supply and price of oil like some other countries. That's not how capitalism works. That's not the system we've chosen.\n\nIn the current system, any talk of \"energy independence\" with oil is a fantasy. In a global free market system, it isn't possible. The break-even point on US oil is always going to be higher, and because of that, we're always going to be at the mercy of countries with better geology and oil that's cheaper to produce.",

It's not just a simple product; it's a commodity, whose futures are traded and invested and baked into derivatives in markets on three continents. That's why, as some others in this thread have tried to point out (sarcastically and unhelpfully), gas prices are high the world over. Domestic production can't and won't help. \n\n2) Oil companies are pulling in record PROFITS right now. Not record revenues; record profits. The last time prices spiked, under Bush, it was the same thing. Even if the costs of production have gone up, the prices we're paying at the pump have gone up MORE, and all of that money is going right into the pockets of the oil barons.\n\nWhat's happening now is that market volatility has made oil, as a commodity, more valuable, such that they are justified in charging more for what they have, even though it doesn't even cost more to produce. Since, in times of turmoil such as this, oil *might* be more scarce, it could theoretically be hoarded instead of consumed, and investors know this, and the markets reflect that possibility. The oil companies are basically saying, \"Hey, we could just sell it all to nervous hoarders, so if you want it, it'll cost ya more.\" This would be fine if it were a luxury product, but it's not; it's a necessity in modern civilzation, and capitalism is a terrible system when it comes to necessities like water or healthcare or food -- all of which are in plenty of supply, but people still die because they can't \"afford\" it. \n\nThe solution? Nationalize the oil industry, sell it all at cost, minimize its exposure to speculative investments. Instead, both political parties are just mouthpieces for oil companies companies, and the rest of us are fucked fucked fucked.",

A large portion of the instant change of fuel prices has to do with contracts and futures.

In order to compensate for that net loss, prices elsewhere (the consumer gas pump) went up. That\u2019s one example that illustrates one small aspect of this incredibly complex issue.",

Basically, they *lower supply* if the demand drops, which it did for more than a year during the worst of the pandemic.  Oil companies were cutting jobs and investment all over the place trying to cope in 2020.

If so, what is that difference?\n\nDirect democracy is the population directly voting on policy (as opposed to voting for representatives who vote on policy), it's not having every vote count equally. Those are two different aspects.\n\nIf I follow your argument correctly, you're saying Missourians' vote should count more because they're fewer people. But wouldn't that mean they also contribute less to the budget? Obviously minority interests don't count as much as majority interests in a democracy, that's the whole point of democracy. What's the benefit in artificially inflating the significance of minority interests? If 8 people in a group vote for going to McDonald's and 2 vote for going to the fancy Italian restaurant, what's the benefit of putting more weight on the minority's vote? \n\nIn your example, who gets to weigh the interests of Californians vs. Missourians? Who decides what individual votes are worth and on what basis?",

Something is \"pure democracy\" if a certain number of people is involved but once that number reaches a certain threshold, it's \"mob rule\"? That just sounds like a different word for the same thing. I'd also ask you again to point out why one is bad and the other isn't as you haven't clarified that yet. \n\n> The rest of your post is just proving the need for electoral college.\n\nPlease explain why you think that. What you perceive as obvious is not as clear for people not privy to your thought process. \n\n>You're already treating Missouri like a child that has to eat where he's told to eat, and not like an adult that can get in his car and eat wherever he wants.\n\nI'm not treating anybody like anything, I'm trying to find out why you believe the votes of the minority should outweigh the votes of the majority. Let's stay on topic and leave emotions out of it, please. What makes you think Missouri being outvoted is treating them unfairly or like a child? Wouldn't the same thing apply to Californians being outvoted by Missourians? According to the logic you lay out here, the electoral college is necessary in order to treat Californians like children instead of Missourians. Is that really what you're trying to argue?\n\n>The number of people in a state don't matter except in as far as they inform that state's electors of the people's will.\n\nThe humber of people does matter since you're arguing that states with fewer people should count more than states with higher population. I'm trying to find out why you believe this is a fair system. \n\n>Each state can be thought of as a miniature country, part of a larger federation. \n\nLet's think of states as a miniature country, then. Why should some miniature countries' votes count more than others and how is that fair? You've yet to make that argument. \n\n>Would you argue that France and Germany alone should get to decide all of EU's policies?\n\nNo, I would argue that their votes should count as much as every other member state's. Would you argue that Belgiums votes should count more than France's? If so, please explain how that would be fair. \n\n>If not, why should California and New York dictate the policies of this union?\n\nI don't like that distinction you're implying. When votes are counted unequally, it's a democratic decision but when all votes count equally, it's \"dictating policies\". That's not the case. You have a number of people who vote for something. The majority vote wins. That's a simple and fair system and I have yet to hear a single argument for artificially skewing vote weights that benefits the federation. \n\nIn all your arguing for unequal votes, you're not forgetting the House of Representatives which gives states proportional representation based on populace already, correct?",

For the most part, even if you drive to work every day, gas prices aren't going to make or break your finances. Even doubling the price of gas amounts to what..like.. $20 a week? I don't drive very much anymore thanks to public transit, but even when I did.. we're talking a tank of gas at $3 a gallon vs a tank of gas at $5 a gallon. That's about $20 for my Toyota Corolla's 11 gallon gas tank. That tank of gas will get me through at least a week of work. Monthly charges for gas prices doubling would be about $100 total. That's without making any effort whatsoever to curb gas usage. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n$100 a month absolutely CAN be enough to destroy someone these days, but more importantly, the gas prices affect the price of shipping goods, and in turn may lead to certain goods being priced higher. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll this being said, most people that yell about gas prices don't actually feel the impact of the gas prices changing in a substantial way. For a household earning middle class wages, $100 a month should be doable pretty easily. If it's NOT doable, we need to really start looking at the reasons why a $1 or $2 increase in gas prices is making you worry about falling into poverty. That's not a problem with gas prices, that's a problem with wages. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI still think most of the loudest people who yell about gas prices don't actually see an iota of change in their quality of life. I think people just like to have struggles to talk about, and, even though the whole world is blowing up and those of us not on fire should be counting our blessings, some people get jealous that those who are currently engulfed in flames are getting more attention than them.",

This was a very specific claim about what I thought of your posting habit. \n\nLet me explain a little further: responses in Reddit threads have two dimensions. The first is obvious--you're talking to the original commenter. The second is more subtle, but probably more important--you're talking to the reading public. That's why there's a voting system, so that readers can react to your input. When you post something on a highly-ranked comment, it's going to be read by most of the people who are then going on to read further comments. When you copy/paste the same response on a lower-ranked comment it's just redundant and it seems oblivious to the second (more important) conversational dynamic. \n\nI think that's what seems cringy about it and why it seems out of touch with the medium. And yes, I do lean right--although I'm not a dogmatist for anyone. But accusing me of being conservative and therefore disingenuous is ironic here because, by doing that, you're trying to poison the well.",

Anyone being mass murdered is a tragedy, and if that actually happened to either side, I think we would come together on that pretty damn quick.\n\nThe problem is that it's so hard to be sympathetic towards a group that thinks a bunch of other groups of people are invalid human beings. The right wing now isn't fiscal, it's almost entirely social. Trans bans, abortion bans, banning history that puts white people in a bad light...y'all need some serious fucking PR. It's become the party of \"we hate absolutely everything that isn't the narrow scope of shit we think is good\". It's almost impossible to not be seen as \"the enemy\" when you are against so much shit that doesn't concern any of you.\n\nAll that said, absolutely no one should die for it. They should be educated. We need massive adjustments in school funding, we need to instill empathy in the population again, and we need to remove brain poison like special interest groups and foreign infiltrators in social media/other media sowing discord. A lot of this starts with Democrats actually starting to help people, and showing that it's not all just bullshit lip service, because that is a SERIOUS ally in the corner of frustrated desperate people that need something to blame.

Personally I am for a woman\u2019s right to choose when it comes to abortion within reasonable limits (late term abortions should never be legal unless it is to save a mother\u2019s life or is the best medically sound decision that can be made). I am all for gay marriage. The church and state are to be separate and cannot under any circumstances impede on the rights of anyone. There are tons of very well educated and very reasonable republicans out there that feel pretty abandoned by what has become a voice in the party. I\u2019ve pondered whether I should really call myself republican at all since I differ in so many ways from the party itself but the fact is I\u2019m not alone and it requires people willing to speak up for anything to change.",

Most of the RW subs will not only hand out bans for almost anything, but most of them require proof of political loyalty for users to even post in the first place.\n\nFrankly, I miss there being more people around to argue with. :)",

Pretty much every other nation is worse off and its citizens has to pay more per gallon when compared to the average monthly wage. Republicans should be thanking biden for putting us in the LEAST BAD situation. Beisde, gas prices are out of his control. I can even make the argument that it is partly Trump\u2019s fault since he should have been moving us away from fossils fuels and toward green energy. If he was pro-renewables, we would not  be so dependent on  fluctuating oil prices. \n\nThat being said, I feel bad for Biden and the Dems. Republicans are so brainwashed that they will complain about anything and everything no matter what Biden does. If he eliminated the debt and single handedly killed Xi Ping on live television, then the Republicans will still say something bad about him. If If Biden invented a time machine by himself, went back in time and killed hitler while he wad still in the womb, then the republicans would try to impeach him for giving an abortion. Republicans love to say how patriotic they are and how unamerican dems are for \u201cbad mouthing our President\u201d when trump was in office, but dont skip a beat to shit all over president Biden and praise the leader of an enemy nation that we are at war with. \n\nHow is complementing the dictator of an hostile anti-American authoritarian regime that we are at war with somehow not unAmerican, but protesting police brutality and demanding that schools teach the evils of slavery \u201canti-American and unpatriotic\u201d. I am beginning to think that I was sucked into an alternate reality on my sleep the night before the 2016 presidential election. \n\nANYWAY, THANK YOU FOR ATTENDING MY TED TALK.

I'm also banned from some of these subs because I'm a member of r/libertarian, and even though nobody on r/libertarian can agree on what -real- libertarianism is, they know it makes me a reactionary. I think I'm also banned from r/conservative for something extraordinarily mundane. \n\nThe moral of the story is that political extremists really hate having their views challenged and can't defend or aren't comfortable defending them outside of their bubble.",

But in all fairness, they've unironically fostered an environment of groupthink that forbids individual critical thought; much like with the tankies' groupthink exercises, if you fail to nod along and say Trump Good Biden Bad, you get the ban. In contrast, the libertarian sub openly allows and encourages people who disagree with libertarianism to come in and debate the merits of libertarian policy, and people who whine about r/libertarian not being enough of an echo chamber are routinely called out. The fostering of groupthink and conforming to the group or else facing exile is one of the drivers in social media driven unrest spilling over into real life, in my opinion. Basically, you'll never find a (to invent a term) maximally extreme position on the internet. There's always a more extreme position to be found, and removing people willing to question those positions (purity testing) is essentially encouraging extremism, both by cleansing the echo chamber of critical thinkers and by sending the message that people who try to pump the brakes get the bullet first.",

      "text": "When I was a barber. I cut a couple of gas station owners. Back when gasoline was $4.00 a gallon they were making .09 cents profit on every gallon. So the local gas station is not price gouging. And when gasoline was $4.00 a gallon before. It was when Biden was Vice President. Oil is a natural product. People have preserved wood by painting the wood with used motor oil. The grass around the wooden privacy fence painted with used motor oil was actually greener and more grass growing than the grass away from the fence that did not get used motor oil drippings. And it preserves privacy fence wood for 25+ years. Amazing! That in itself showed me how \u201cnatural\u201d oil is. I love the outdoors and the animals in it. But we are not saving any of it by having oil drilled and delivered from other countries around the world. If another country \u201cspills\u201d oil or contaminates underground water while they are drilling for us then we never know it or can not clean it up. Therefore damaging the earth farther. We live on a whole earth. America is only One country on this earth. So if we are concerned about the Earth  or the Globe then it makes more sense to drill for oil here in America where we will clean up anything that would happen immediately and the oil could be transported inside underground pipes instead of polluting our earth with emissions from the ships and trucks and whatever other form of transportation is involved in delivering oil from 1000\u2019s miles away to our local gas station! Canada is oil rich. So is Alaska. Why can\u2019t we just tap into these areas and finish building the pipeline that would get our oil to us more earth efficiently? Due to the supply chain problems, there is not a way to make electric vehicles quickly enough for Americans to even have them available to purchase. And the fact that most American families cannot afford to turn in their existing vehicle in order to purchase an electric vehicle. And, if the gas prices continue to go up, no one is going to be able to afford to buy an electric vehicle if this inflation keeps going for the next year or two. So, it\u2019s common sense to slice the red tape that oil companies have against them in America. And let them drill here and finish the next huge pipeline-that would be completed in less than 2 years if started on now. And we would not only be actively saving our earth, but making Americans be able to afford to drive to work, the doctor, the grocery store which would get us out of this needless downward spiraling economy. And, also how are these power stations, for charging the electric cars, operating? Probably the local power company who still uses fossil fuels-fuels that come from the ground. And if you look closely, some of these politicians have family businesses that involve shipping. So wouldn\u2019t it hit their personal pocketbooks if we were not \u201cshipping\u201d oil from other countries to America? And what is going to happen to our precious earth if it gets bombed here and there? The buildings that tumble to the ground\u2026asbestos is in old concrete, flooring, and other materials that was put there for the purpose of a cheap filler. And asbestos goes airborne! And, I think it was last year, that we had a cloud of sand from possibly Saudi Arabia or somewhere around there that made its way around the world and from the west coast to the east coast of America. It made the air look hazy. So air pollution travels. Point\u2026local gas stations are not price gouging. We have huge amounts of natural resources here. It is cleaner for America and the whole earth to get our own oil instead of transporting it in. And by paying countries that have crooked governments, especially the ones who hate Americans, and making those countries have employment and oil profits-thus making them have more money for their militaries-which leads to more bombings-which leads to more air pollution. Why not just use our common sense and Buy American and Canadian Oil? And give Americans employment, lowering the gas prices, lowering the air pollution, having control over how to cleanly get the oil extracted, and finishing the pipeline so that we can transport this oil safely and economically underground Thus eliminating this price hike EVER AGAIN in American history! We were energy independent in 2020. Why the change? What was so bad about Americans having jobs and being able to drive their vehicles? This can all be changed with the swipe of one ink pen.",

That reduction caused the cost of oil to drop. To take the lowest point in the cost of oil during a pandemic and then the highest point before a coming war when one of them is an oil exporter after a spike in oil based on speculation. Even if the numbers were true, is hardly realistic. Biden didn\u2019t cause the pandemic, oil speculation, or the war. It was completely out of his hands. Same goes for Trump job loss due to the pandemic, or Biden job growth after it. European wars, Pandemics and any job or economic downfalls can not be considered 100% on any president\u2019s leadership. What can be considered? How they dealt with those situations. Trump helped companies spearhead the search for a cure, and at the same time denied the pandemics existence. He refused to help the public deal with and prepare. He refused to explain the importance of protecting themselves by using masks. Why, because the look of him waring a mask, in his mind, made him look weak. That is bad leadership. Biden, did everything in his power to bring in the right people to support him in brining back the economy. He had no reason not to. He did not just claim it was all by his hand alone while playing golf. Now, He is trying his best to support Ukraine, a democratic country, but also keep Americans safe. He has been upfront as much as any president I have ever seen. Choosing to declassify a lot of intelligence to keep Americans and the world informed.",

And there are to many people who \u201creport\u201d (what they have interpreted) as Facts and it goes on and on. When you see countries like Ukraine and how they help each other, with not a second thought. And how they willingly stay to fight and watch their families move to safety\u2026.I really don\u2019t think-based on the way Americans treat each other as \u201cthe enemy\u201d that if that were to ever happen here\u2026Would we literally love another enough to see each other as fellow Americans and fight for our country? So that we would not be taken over by another country that told us half truths? In Iraq, when Saddam Hussein was still alive, there was 2 television stations. 1-Saddam Hussein tv and #2-Saddam Hussein tv. That was it! And Russia\u2026the people are not getting the truth over there. Point is\u2026we are not getting the whole truth either. And if we keep kicking each other down just to \u201cbe the one who is right\u201d we are going to eventually kick ourselves in the foot and not have any freedoms to speak out, joke around, etc. Yes, there are people out there that believe some very unrealistic stuff! But not all people believe the same way in the same \u201cgroup\u201d. And posts like this one by Charlie Kirk well, if people didn\u2019t get so defensive and give so much attention to \u201cout of the park\u201dposts then maybe people would stop posting unrealistic posts. I\u2019m dreaming now\ud83d\ude06 But the bad attention is any attention has to go! Because it is tearing our Free Country apart!",

The masks are obviously rated on % of contaminates that can not go through. So N95 is 95% of a certain particle size not getting through the mask. I had to wear N99 when doing mold remediation  (which are rated for gas and aerosol particle size) because the N95 still made me have lung issues. Therefore I knew, from experience, that masks were not the savior. Of course masks help from blocking your own particles from going all over -hence surgeon masks-that make the patient who is on the operating table not get particles from the surgery team into their body. But masks do not help keep airborne particles out unless you are wearing a mask rated for certain particles size and wearing the mask properly and you know so because you can not smell anything because the mask is working. Sorry off topic. But it was a response to a post on Trump and masks etc. Point\u2026to many people making \u201cnews\u201d without having life experience and years of research on certain subjects.

All the pipe line would do is lead it to a port in Texas. Nothing about this would mean the price of gas in the USA or even other nations would be reduced.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRemember with lock down the price of gas dropped because there was no demand. So oil companies reduced production because why make so much if you aren't going to sell it. Now more activities as the world is opening back up again and the demand increased. The events in Ukraine are not helping anything. But the idea the keystone would actually help this at all is not supported by any bit of details given about the plans for the pipeline.",

You literally just said \"if the US was energy independent they can control the prices in the US\". Since oil is sold on an international market, in which prices are a function of international supply and demand, then the only ways to control oil prices domestically are price controls and export restrictions.

You'd have to restrict exports. Otherwise you'd just have an oil shortage. Again, this isn't particularly complicated. We had a crude oil export ban for 40 years until 2015 so it's not like it's a crazy idea.",

Oil is priced based on international supply and demand, not domestic, so you put price controls in place. Now oil companies can either sell domestically for a lower price or sell to another country for a higher price, so obviously they'll sell internationally unless there's something in place to force them to \"prioritize oil for yourself\" as you said. What exactly is that thing that would make them prioritize the US? They're definitely not going to do it out of the kindness of their hearts. Probably some kind of restriction on exporting, right? You might even call it a ban, because that's what we called it for 40 years. Rub a couple brain cells together for this one.",

The drop in prices is what diminished the supply because a lot of smaller oil producers went out of business during 2020.\n\nDo you understand how supply and demand works? Operations in the Arctic and New Mexico were not stopped, just the additional leasing of land. When the government leases land, it takes several years for those companies to develop the infrastructure and start extracting oil from them - it's not an immediate effect, this wouldn't affect oil supply or prices for YEARS, even if Biden opened up every square inch of public land available.\n\nAdditionally, the Biden administration has had the most fossil fuel leases in US history (higher than under Trump) yet thousands of these have not been taken up by fossil fuel companies for extraction. Which makes Biden a fossil fuel hawk who's policies are terrible for the environment - maybe even worse than Trump.\n\n>Raising taxes and adding a bunch of regulations\n\nDid not happen, you can't provide any examples of things that didn't take place.\n\n>Which in turn made us rely on opec\n\nSo why didn't Trump save small domestic oil producers in 2020?\n\nIt wasn't actually Trump's fault, I don't believe that because I'm not a moron - but IF you actually believe certain policies can greatly affect oil prices, then why didn't Trump save small oil producers in 2020? If Biden somehow has affected gas prices, then Trump must have too - be consistent.\n\nYou simply do not understand supply and demand.",

Also, in another glaring example of your lack of understanding of supply and demand - PIPELINES DON'T PRODUCE OIL!!!! They only TRANSPORT oil.\n\nKeystone XL is actually antithetical to energy independence too because it imports CANADIAN oil - which by the way, is still being imported at the highest volumes that are available for import. This pipeline made absolutely no difference and it's only purpose would've been to maintain a high transport capacity for oil for decades to come (which we need to ween off to avoid the catastrophic effects of climate change). The only difference this pipe makes is how cheaply ONE private oil corporation can import oil into the US, it doesn't affect supply, it doesn't affect whether the oil gets here or not - it just makes it cheaper for ONE corporation to do so, which doesn't affect market prices considering only a small fraction of Canadian oil imports would come from that pipeline.\n\n>had 100 of Trumps environmental policies all reviewed and reversed\n\nTrump is the one that reversed the environmental policies, Biden merely restored them. None of these affected the price of oil, they had to do with pollution controls, fuel efficiency in cars, and endangered species regulations restoration.",
