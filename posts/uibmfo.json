It wasn't funny, nor was it meant to be.\n\nBack on topic though, people from Oaxaca are well used to people calling it Oaxaca Cheese (in English). It's mostly only called Quesillo in Spanish. I get that many Mexican foods are mostly referred to as their Spanish name (eg, Burrito, Enchilada, Chalupa, Tortillas, Tamales, Taco, Gordita, Fritata, Alb\u00f3ndigas, Salsa, Guacamole etc.), but you will find more information for the cheese searching for \"Oaxaca Cheese\" than \"Quesillo\". \n\nThe problem is that Quesillo is something different in other Spanish speaking countries...\n\n* Flan in [Canary Islands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiwkGrULrAg)\n* Cheese Wrap in [Dominican Republic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FodpA3eHhGk). Often doesn't use the same cheese as from Oaxaca.\n* In Chile and Bolivia, Quesillo doesn't refer to Oaxacan Cheese, but Cheese made in the Cochabamba valley which is made in a different way to Oaxacan Cheese.\n* Cheese Wrap in [Nicaragua](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_0NGdtX_GE). Often a different type of cheese.\n* In [Peru, Quesillo refers to small hand made cheeses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6rP2IqCgtY) that are generally sold on the street. They are different to Oaxacan Cheese.\n* Cheese Flan in [Venezuela](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WfVPef0dJg)\n* In the [Phillipines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9pzi3_lDk8) Quesillo is another name for Kesong Puti which is a completely different type of cheese. Different process, Different milk.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quesillo",

Another example is Texas. We say \u201cTejas,\u201d exactly as roof tiles in Spanish. In Mexico there are many more examples, like Xalapa. \n\nAlso, just as a fun fact, Oaxaca is tied to Zapotec and Mixtec cultures historically, despite the used name being N\u00e1huatl.",

There are those that say conception (start of biological life), when the brain has developed and heartbeat is detectable (6-7 weeks but the fetus is 1inch long and many would not realize they are pregnant yet), when all the recognizeable features of a human body are developed (15-16 weeks), when the baby is viable can survive if born prematurely (23-24), or at first breath in the case of a number of religions.\n\nAnd I think that what each person thinks is the start of \"personhood\" is very very different and shouldn't be defined by others. So I am also pro-choice, especially, especially if there's any risk to the mother's mental or physical health.",

(And if you don't believe me- black babies literally cost less to adopt through private agencies than white babies).   \n\n\nI'm an adoptee, and I know most people don't understand the difference between private infant adoption and the foster care system, but private infant adoption only stands to benefit- to the extent that it was a part of ACB's opinion brief.   \n\n\nThere are 34 couples to every baby up for adoption, and the pandemic allowed more people than ever to keep their babies. The billion-dollar private adoption industry in America is struggling to meet the demand for healthy white babies, and they have been pushing for these pro-life laws since Roe V. Wade.",

I would say that you are making an incredibly difficult decision, so please ask all the questions you need.   \n\n\nI have nothing against relinquishment, and I am in no way trying to talk you out of it- but please do know that anything your adoption agency promises you about your ability to be in your baby's life after the adoption is not enforceable by law. Adoption agencies are notorious for promising this and that, and it's entirely up to the adoptive parents as to whether or not they want to follow through. Many adoption agencies will dance around that fact all day long.   \n\n\nIf at any point, for any reason, before you have signed away your parental rights, you change your mind - that is your right. If your agency threatens you with having to repay any assistance they've given you throughout the pregnancy, that is not legal.   \n\n\nI don't know if you have one of the especially scummy adoption agencies, so none of that may be applicable, but I want to know every first mom or potential first mom I come across is aware of their rights.   \n\n\nAnd just from another member of the adoptee triad- please make plans to seek professional mental health help following birth. So many first moms I know have a lot of mental health troubles following relinquishment. I know mine did for sure.   \n\n\nAlso, please try and keep detailed track of your family's medical history and the baby's father's medical history. I have VERY little medical history, and that's been really problematic as I've gotten older.   \n\n\nSorry for the essay!! Again, I'm not trying to sway your opinion, just telling you things I know other first moms have told me they wish they knew and things I wish MY first mom knew!",

It also refers to the coercive tactics some agencies use to convince young women to give up the pregnancies they want to keep. \n\nAgain- does not mean it is not the right choice for you and your baby!\n\nI will say there are some green flags, but do keep in mind your adoption coordinator gets paid when the papers are signed, so it's in their best interest to be non-judgemental and supportive. That's not to say they are not actually there to help! Many are! Just something to keep in mind. \n\nI'm so glad to hear you want to be a part of your baby's life!! Do press on that with your potential APs! Good APs will be on board - more people to love your kids the better! Just be aware that it's not at all legally enforceable. \n\nThat said- if your agency is pushing for you to meet and choose APs right away, that can be a red flag. If the agency is pushing to have the parents in the room while you give birth, that's a red flag.  If the agency pushes you to sign anything indicating you'll give up your parental rights before you actually give up your parental rights, that's a red flag. Personally, I would ask APs what their plan is to make sure the child knows their history. \n\nInterracial adoption is also sometimes difficult. I am not an interracial adoptee, but my sister is, and she definitely didn't have enough black people in her life to look up to, and struggled with her self image for it. If you are talking to a white couple, I would bring that up! What's their friend group look like diversity wise? Where do they live? Are there black people there? \n\nI really really hope you don't feel like I'm trying to talk you out of it because that's not my intention! I just know a lot of first moms go in blind, and I don't want you to. I know I've mentioned the negatives a lot, but I love my adoptive parents so much, and I love my first family even though we don't have much of a relationship. I wish some things about my adoption had been different, and have a lot of problems with the industry as a whole, but I am not upset that I was adopted. (I am also not grateful! But I digress). I hope that this is helpful, and I hope that you get everything you need and want from this process and experience. Please feel free to DM me anytime!",

This is a large part of the reason behind why they aren't concerned with introducing more resources for single mothers and poor parents - they do not want them to keep the child. They want the child to go to the couple they know from church who have been on a waitlist for years. \n\nMy (adoptive) mother has absolutely zero respect for the biological relationship. To her, uprooting a child from wherever it may be and placing it with someone more wealthy, more Christian, older... This can only be a benefit to the child. She does not, for example, see the benefit in policies that strive to keep families together when CPS gets involved. And I think that her views are pretty typical.\n\nAdoption is traumatic.

I bet if you charged them $35,000 to Begin the breeding process the birthrate would exponentially decline.\n\nI'm not anti adoption and neither were my friends, but $35,000 a child is REDICULOUS. They MUST fix that ESPECIALLY if RvW is dropped. I make A LOT of money in my household and that amount is still cost inhibitive and we do nothing and save our money! My friends were taking out home equity loans and maxing out credit cards for the in vitro that was cheaper in the long run! They're the tightest people I know with spending money.",

Ever!!!! (If enough people are poor in a district, then ALL children get free breakfast and lunch). This can make or break families on the edge!\n\nUniversal healthcare? A parent shouldn't have to choose between medicine and food. \n\nSo many other things that OTHER industrial first world countries have figured out!!! \n\nWe support children and parents NONE once they're out of the uterus. At the line of poverty, and even we'll above it, isn't comfortable at all.\n\nWhile I spoke about my income now, I haven't had it easy all the time. I'll never unfeel the not easy.

This isn't some blind belief religious argument that something just \"is\" - those only work among the people who follow them.

We've disagreed that it has personhood - capable of sentient thought, pain, emotion, etc.  A very small minority of pro-choice want to allow abortion until birth occurs - and they follow different views, views that aren't held by enough to gain a majority voice even among just the liberal populace. The overwhelming near-total majority of pro-choice believe in two important points: One, allowing abortion without restriction up to some point of viability/mental development based on a number of factors. Two, allowing abortion for extreme cases after that point, like saving the life of the mother or a fetus that is brain dead etc.\n\nYou can't just say \"pro-life people think the fetus is human\" and imply that pro-choice doesn't as well.  You DO need to clarify, because it's clear you think of it as \"a human individual, with personhood\", when pro-choice does not believe that in the slightest yet still holds that \"a fetus is human\".\n\nBasically, we can say a fetus IS human (part of the species homo sapiens) without implying a fetus IS A human (has personhood).",

It was, in fact, a very good analogy.  You see, analogies have two points to them: The part that is similar, and the part that isn't.   When we make analogies, we're using the dissimilar parts to compare the similar ones.  So long as the dissimilar parts aren't relevant to the focus of the analogy, it can hold up just fine.\n\nI compared two living organisms - remember, all life came from the same original cellular development and is distantly related. Plants and humans may be very far apart now, but they're still forms of cellular LIFE.\n\nSo in this comparison, I compared one type of life to another.  Because stages of life, which we grow through, are a shared characteristic!  The thing that was most similar in this analogy was the concept of life *growing*.\n\n> Growing -  (of a living thing) undergoing natural development by increasing in size and changing physically.\n\nBoth humans and plants do this.  And, would you look at that - both have different defined states of growth! And, while growing from one state to another, they are not yet the thing in the other state. In this case you said human body, two bodies, I could quote you like 10 times from your responses where you specifically used the word body.  Well, a fetus is human, as it is from our genetic makeup, but it is not yet a human body.  Because it's growing (there's that word again!) to *become* that, and something can't be growing to a state it already is else it's not growing, it has already become it.\n\n> then admitted human fetus is still human\n\nBecause it is? There's court cases where pro-choice movement members have adamantly admitted this fact, because all stages of life are still parts of the human species.  That doesn't make them an *individual person* before birth.\n\nIf you're so dead set on defining a fetus as human, you'd best go find a way to save all the sperm teenage boys are jacking off into tissues.  Or save the eggs that women's bodies dispose of once a month.\n\nIt's just stages of life at that point, undeveloped, not a person, clumps of cells.  Any definition otherwise - until the point of brain development and impulses that can convey thought - is a false definition that leans on belief in a soul that not all of us believe in and should not be forced by theocratic laws to be beholden to.  That's an individual belief that you can live by but this ain't The Crusades, we won't have you forcing those beliefs on us anymore.",

The suffering that you\u2019re creating is leading to suffering from the people that they may hurt.\n\nIt\u2019s *most likely going to be shitty* when you force someone to take responsibility of a being they don\u2019t believe they can properly care for.\n\n>\tMaybe we should allocate some more resources for them and get them more help\n\nHow far can we go? Are we willing to use our taxes to pay for all of that child\u2019s needs - for every child that we force into this world? Even just half of what these kids need (if it\u2019s a single parent)?\n\nRepublicans, the ones pushing this forced birth agenda, are never going to let that happen. They cut social services at every opportunity that they get. The more conservative a state is the fewer resources they have access to.\n\nHundreds of thousands of kids are in the foster care system and would love nothing more than to be adopted. \n\nIf you work hard to stop abortion legal abortions before we have these social services properly set up - you are directly creating incalculable suffering in this world where it wouldn\u2019t have existed before.",

People have a huge desire to be \"normal\" and have normal kids. So what happens in 10 to 20 years when genetic engineering is available to people? Will short men be terminated? What about asthma, its a terrible disorder to make your child suffer through. Maybe this guy only has 1 hand instead of two. Oh, what a miserable life that would be, lets save them the trouble of going through life with one hand...\n\nIf history teaches us anything, its that the moral judgements of the day do not hold up very long at all.\n\nWho the fuck is to say what a viable life is, and what are good traits and bad traits? Imagine if people started thinking aggression was bad so we started selecting away people who have a genetic proclivity towards violence and aggression.",

When I voice these concerns, the responses I get are baffling.\n\nOn one hand, there's the prolifers arguing that I'm evil for considering any kind of abortion potentially justifiable.\n\nOn the other, pro-choice proponents argue I'm a religious zealot or misogynist for suggesting there might be some times that abortion isn't justifiable.\n\nThere's no room to compromise or debate.  I'm just a secularists trying to discuss the ethics of when humans aquire their rights, what those rights are, and when its appropriate to ignore the rights of one human in to honor the rights of another.  But I'm framed as a villan by both camps because the false dichotomy of no abortion v all abortion.",

If humans only aquire their rights after birth is completed, then you could chop up a baby as they were being born and have not violated their rights.\n\n\nNew South Wales allows abortions up to 22 weeks.  That's the later part of the second trimester.\n\nAbortion bills like this pop up all the time, some of them even pushing for the legalization of full term abortions.\n\nIm not explicitly apposed to any specific cutoff date, just that there should be one, and not worded as, this is the time when abortion is illegal.

Either way they get to a point where its dark and they set up camp and sit around a fire.  The capturers were feeling like picking on their new POWs and were like \u201chey, jews. Why dont you sing some of your jew songs about your jew god dumbasses\u201d and one of the men among them started singing \u201cblessed be those who take your kids and smash their heads into the side of cliffs\u201d and the story ended. Very funny story but psalms is pretty much entirely either small anecdotes like these that took place in between Davids crowning and the birth of jesus and also its full of songs. Its not exactly intellectually honest to just point at a random passage and be like \u201cthis is a rule your god believes in\u201d when it could be anything, like POWs having a Call of Duty lobby moment.",

I\u2019m thinking there\u2019s another way to reduce abortions that most people can agree on\u2026\n\nI\u2019d like to guarantee a decent life for every child by having the govt guarantee **healthcare, housing, and education**, as well as **subsidize birth control and vasectomies** and fund research into better forms. This will result in more people choosing to keep the babies or not having them in the first place.\n\nAlso **transform adoption, foster care, and orphanages until they are a great life for the kids**. Think private school with lots of well-paid caretakers, well-educated in child psychology, with each one not overseeing too many. The facilities would need to have many resources and be a fun place for the kids to live with sports facilities, art studios, theaters, gaming lounges, etc. \n\nWith this, abortion falls naturally and then ban it when not that many people want it for necessary reasons. \n\nThis would be paid for by taxing people with over $50 million. I think many people on both sides of the debate would buy into this. Conservatives get their abortion ban and liberals get universal healthcare etc and don\u2019t feel that abortions are as necessary any more. And the kids win. Everyone does except some rich people who don\u2019t want to be taxed more.",

I'm pro choice and not religious at all by the way, but I believe an embryo is human life and human life is distinctly valuable and unique. I just disagree with the argument that abortion should be legal simply because a woman should have full autonomy over her body. It's a human life she is ending and any argument over body autonomy should include an argument of body autonomy for the unborn fetal life. So what you're saying is you don't believe an unborn baby is human life and we simply disagree, that's all.",

I want the best for orphans and children in the foster care system, and want us to make these systems better. Nevertheless, I don't wanna kill 'em off early. \n\nPls don't bring up veganism, cuz that's a sorry excuse. I do believe in the humane treatment of animals, but like 99% of the world I hold most animals to be of lesser value than humans. I'm very biased that way. But we all are tbh. Also, if someone believes that animal life is as valuable as human life, they shouldn't do a lot of the things they do, including, but not limited to, driving a car on the highway smashing the bodies of mayflies and the like. I mean there's a philosophical debate in regards to veganism, but as I do not value life by the metric of brain capacity or mental consciousness, I may as well well advocate for not eating rocks. My argument is that human personhood shouldn't be denied a person because they're small dumb, ugly, crippled, or helpless. We can't draw these distinctions. You'll find a lot of people in society are helpless and needy, that doesn't mean we can kill 'em. Ain't right. \n\nI don't believe that these fetuses are POTENTIAL life.  I believe they have life from start to finish, which is indisputable, but mean real human, personhood. \n\nThat being said, I want the best for women that find themselves with unwanted pregnancies.

But when I meet a person who says a fetus at 2 weeks is a baby I always ask so if a woman has a miscarriage and sees the blood in the toilet. Should she flush it or does she need scoop it out and bury it like a child?  The look of a shock and disgust on their face is always interesting. \n\nAnd I explain well if it's a baby then shouldn't it be given a proper burial and not flushed. And typically when this happens the woman doesn't know that she's miscarried and often was unaware she was pregnant. So do we expect the woman to every time she sees blood in the toilet to scoop it out and assume that it's a miscarriage?  \n\nThen I follow up with them and say whenever you see blood in the toilet do you assume it's your period or is it a miscarriage how do you know?  I would not be surprised to hear that you've actually flushed a baby down the toilet.\n\nI have had a few women attempt violence at this point.",

It haunts me sometimes. I use the words \"I lost my baby\" even though it was a fetus.\n\nAnd still, I fully support abortion. Yes, I say \"I lost my baby,\" but what came out of me wasn't a baby. I lost the baby I could have had, but what exited my body was a bundle of cells in a gestational sac. It couldn't survive outside of my body. The \"baby\" was as nebulous as any of the random eggs that bleeds out during a period. I only knew it was a fetus because I'd been actively trying and testing so knew when I was pregnant. Otherwise I 100% would have assumed it was a weird period.\n\nSo basically, this is spot on and I hope it makes pro-birthers uncomfortable (not pro-life because they sure as fuck don't care about the baby once its born)",

But the downside is that unisom is a sleep aid, so I'm really tired. That said, better than nauseous (which is what happens when I don't take it). But the nausea still creeps in. I've just accepted it as life now. For some people nothing will truly work except for not being pregnant anymore. Haha",

I was sicker than I've ever been in my life, I had the worst headaches, and couldn't even take anything for them because I just immediately vomited the pill and the water used to swallow it. It was terrible. And absolutely no appetite and just felt... drained. Like I had no energy to even get out of bed. \n\nI'm thankful that I had such a rough go of it though, because I was on birth control and at the time my periods were irregular enough that skipping entire months wasn't unusual. So without those extra symptoms, I wouldn't have even thought to get tested until it would have been too late. \n\nI also was happy about my abortion. I mean, the experience still sucked, because it was expensive (~$800) and invasive. At the time medical abortions were only FDA approved until 7 weeks, so I had to have a transvaginal ultrasound to confirm it was early enough.  And time consuming because the nearest clinic was a two hour drive away, and I had to go twice. \n\nBut holy shit, it might have just been placebo effect, but it only took about an hour after taking the mifeprostone before the constant nausea went away and my headache started to subside. And two days later when I completed the process with the misoprostol, I felt nothing but extreme relief that it was all over, and I didn't have to stress about an unwanted pregnancy anymore.\n\nI share this story because there are plenty of women like me who have a positive reaction to our abortions and are made to feel like monsters, even by people \"on our side\", when they insist that it must be a traumatic, terrible experience and hard decision for everyone.\n\nSometimes its just *fine*.",

Again:\n\n> I believe if you are going to bring a child into the world that you have to have a responsibility to that child ... I know I made the right decision.\n\n[Here is the definition of good according to Dictionary.com](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/good):\n\n> morally excellent; virtuous; righteous; pious:\n\n[Here is the definition of right according to Dictionary.com](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/right):\n\n> in accordance with what is good, proper, or just: \n\nSo in saying it was the \"right decision,\" she is in fact saying that it's **good**, proper, or just. That's what \"right\" means. She's also saying it's morally excellent. That's what \"good\" means. They are synonyms. She didn't say \"my right to an abortion was good.\" She said her decision to have an abortion was good. Not the potential to make the decision; it's **the decision itself** that was good. And the others saying they are \"proud of my abortion\" are doing just the same. They aren't saying \"I'm proud of the potential to get an abortion.\" They're saying:\n\n> I'm proud of my abortion.\n\nThe abortion itself is the source of pride.",

                      "text": "I think any fetus that is incapable of life outside the womb is not a person. Any fetus is a \"potential\" person; *potentially* a human but not yet.\n\nDo people expect a person to keep a parasitic twin alive? No one does because it's usually just extra legs or arms being removed. \n\nBut what about cases [like this](https://c8.alamy.com/comp/2D3DC5G/an-egyptian-baby-named-manar-maged-lies-waiting-for-an-operation-at-a-hospital-in-the-city-of-banha-40-km-25-miles-north-of-cairo-february-18-2005-egyptian-doctors-said-they-removed-a-second-head-from-a-10-month-old-girl-suffering-from-one-of-the-rarest-birth-defects-in-an-operation-on-saturday-maged-was-in-a-serious-but-improving-condition-after-the-procedure-to-treat-her-for-craniopagus-parasiticus-a-problem-related-to-that-of-conjoined-twins-linked-at-the-skull-as-in-the-case-of-a-girl-who-died-after-surgery-in-the-dominican-republic-a-year-ago-the-second-twin-had-developed-no-bod-2D3DC5G.jpg)? There is a head there but is there sentience? How about the reverse, where there is a fetus with a fully formed spine and limbs and fingers and toes, [growing in the stomach](https://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/doctor-remove-parasitic-twin-2-year-old-boy-stomach-article-1.1472471) of a 2 year old? These cases are rare but there has to be some kind of moral consistency when deciding to save one twin and not the other.\n\nModern technology has saved babies who would not have survived not long ago. The [most premature baby ever born](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-59243796) was this fine young boy who was born at 21 weeks, or at about 5 months of pregnancy. And only with a lot of sophisticated intensive care and an ventilator and 275 days in the hospital.\n\nAt 3-4 months, it is clear that survival chances are slim to none. And even if the chances were better were, it would require a tremendous amount of intensive (and *very expensive*)\ncare. There are many worthy people who cannot access medical care because of the cost and many of these have dependents and whose loss would be catastrophic for them and those that depend on them.\n\nMany people have beliefs that say the soul appears at the instant of conception. However this is a religious belief that not everyone holds and in any case, cannot be demonstrated that such a thing exists. \n\nNobody objects to the the idea of people holding the idea that invisible objects or invisible eternal worlds until the adherents of such sects try to force such things on others who don't think so and force them to conform to *their* religion and the rules of their religion.\n\n We don't want a religious state because we don't all have the same religion and if there's one thing Americans say they don't want, its a religious state imposing religious rules that don't line up with their particular religion. (Remember the panic of US christians appalled at the prospect of sharia law? Same thing, different flavor).",

By what standard is a fetus not human but a baby is?  What is your criteria?

Human life could not exist without carbon. So is it just possible that maybe we shouldn\u2019t be burning all this coal? Just looking for a little consistency here in these anti-abortion arguments.

Which is usually a few moments after the man says \u201cGee, honey, I was going to pull out but the phone rang and it startled me.\u201d Fertilization.\n\n>But even after the egg is fertilized, it\u2019s still six or seven days before it reaches the uterus and pregnancy begins, and not every egg makes it that far. Eighty percent of a woman\u2019s fertilized eggs are rinsed and flushed out of her body once a month during those delightful few days she has. They wind up on sanitary napkins, and yet they are fertilized eggs. **So basically what these anti-abortion people are telling us is that any woman who\u2019s had more than more than one period is a serial killer!** \n\nGeorge Carlin basically asked the same rhetorical question but in a funnier way.",

Gould, who worked in the US, tells a history of the theory of recapitulation. A theory of recapitulation aims to explain the relationship between the embryonic development of an organism (ontogeny) and the evolution of that organism's species (phylogeny). Although there are several variations of recapitulationist theories, most claim that during embryonic development an organism repeats the adult stages of organisms from those species in it's evolutionary history. Gould suggests that, although fewer biologists invoked recapitulation theories in the twentieth century compared to those in the nineteenth and eighteenth centuries, some aspects of the theory of recapitulation remained important for understanding evolution. Gould notes that the concepts of acceleration and retardation during development entail that changes in developmental timing (heterochrony) can result in a trait appearing either earlier or later than normal in developmental processes. Gould argues that these changes in the timing of embryonic development provide the raw materials or novelties upon which natural selection acts.\"",

Once a child can live outside of the mother, the mother DOES NOT have to raise it. Any capable adult can care for an infant or raise one! Once a child is born and alive outside the mother and can sustain life with or without the help of medical intervention it\u2019s a human being. Man I am worried about the average IQ in this country when I have to explain this because of how many comments I've received about how infants can't care for themselves and even 20 year olds need a mother.",

As far science goes, if you actually have been \u201ctrained\u201d, or better yet, educated, in the sciences, then you understand that science is about reproducibility entirely, good science is never ever going to assume things like God, or free will, or natural given rights, science doesn\u2019t anthropomorphize in these ways at all if it\u2019s good science, good science merely exists as a description of current work and findings built of previous work that is organized and described so that it may be reproduced, verified and built upon by absolutely anyone else, anywhere, without the need for any missing elements like God or mysterious forces science doesn\u2019t understand. To invoke mysterious forces in a paper is to perform bad science, and is easily dismissed as such. \n\nCurrently what gives us the right to choice is the human shared understanding and history that many people have died for to transition us away from \u201cmight is right\u201d and \u201can eye for an eye\u201d to document and philosophy based ideals that codify equality and systems for resolving conflict in systems that are described and hopefully as fairly as is currently possible overseen by co-challenging systems of checks so that we don\u2019t revert to mob rule or lawlessness. It absolutely does not require God, and has long been quite capable of existing without the need for God, as God or gods do not issue us our morality, our ability to contain understanding, experience, compassion from both those things, those give us our morality that keeps up adhering to laws and social pacts. You know why atheists and agnostics don\u2019t go around murdering and raping all day while they exist without God? Because they already rape and murder exactly as much as anyone else would without God or Gods or some holy ideal of nature. Replacing the word God with some higher notion of nature is just more of the same, and will result in the same mistakes that you\u2019re seeing the effects from here today.",

Eventually, the universe will lack the energy to keep expanding, and begin shrinking, until it collapses into a singular point and another big bang occurs. Of course, this won't be for an unfathomably long time. Billions or trillions of years.\n\n\nBasically, the theory is that we are living in a universe sized, almost infinitely slow explosion, and once it finishes, all the mass will be back in one place, creating a force big enough for the big bang to occur once more. If it's true, of course what we are experiencing now in it's entirety could be a coincidence. The universe could have existed, collapsed and remade itself an infinite number of times before our current iteration, and it'd be completely impossible to know how many previous times the universe has existed. It would have only been a matter of time before what is currently happening, would happen, no matter how many billions of billions of trillions of trillions of years it took.",

Further, in Exodus 21:22, someone who causes a miscarriage without serious injury is punished with a fine set by the husband while murder is punishable by death; ie a caused miscarriage is not equivalent to dead human. Also important is the \u201cno serious injury\u201d part bc it is exclusively refers to the woman and implies that miscarried fetus isn\u2019t even considered an injury much less murder.",

I personally couldn\u2019t have an abortion unless the fetus had some kind of genetic mutation that meant it would suffer and die upon birth.

Just providing the info to save you from having to deal with trolls.\n\nI think the viability of the fetus entirely misses the point of abortion. A baby that old is not an unwanted baby with no parenting/adoption plan. Over 92.7% of abortions happen before 13 weeks - so when someone misses a period and does a test. The next biggest group, 6.2%, happens between 14-20 weeks, which is when testing for genetic defects and detection of most abnormalities happens and that's when the parent(s) have to either decide the keep the baby (in the case of survivable abnormalities like Downs Syndrome) or have no choice but to terminate because of a fatal defect. Then the smallest group, a little *less* than 1%, happens 21+ weeks. That's when pregnancy complications become much more apparent, when undetected abnormalities are seen, when the fetus dies in the womb or they realize it will die anyway very soon after birth. \nNo one should have to go through birthing that.\n\nAnd the abortion drug used in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters is the same used to induce labor. So really, when people are having induced labor, they are aborting a healthy baby that stays alive and they take home. The terribly unhealthy babies would have died regardless of when the birthing happens.",

I clearly outlined that those aborted in the 2nd and 3rd trimester are aborted because of something tragic, something that either is fatal to the baby, the mother, or both. They are wanted babies that are lost.\n\nAnything terminated before 13 weeks does not have a heart beat, let alone a brain. The \"heartbeat\" the GOP talks about is an electrical signal that the machine then plays a recording of a heartbeat every time the signal is detected. It's the same as when your keypad makes a sound on your phone. You could replace the recording with a duck quacking for the same effect.",

It's the pumping of blood through the heart tubing.\n\nWhat is a common bio-electrical phenomenon? Your nerves firing off whenever you feel something. That doesn't make a sound.\n\nAt 6 weeks, a fetus does not have a heart, it does not have ventricle valves, it doesn't even have blood. It has *none* of the structure that is required to make the sound of a heart.\n\nWhat it does have, is an electrical signal. Neurons starting up within tissue that *later* eventually form ventricle valves and eventually pump blood. Ideally anyway - sometimes things go sideways and the lump of flesh meant to be a heart instead meshes with the lungs or stomach, which is 100% fatal to the fetus and fatal to the mother if not removed. Sometimes the lump of flesh shrivels away, or gets separated from the fetus and depending on how severe the separation, the baby is born without a heart (and *very* very quickly dies soon after) or the heart forms attached, but outside the baby (it still dies.) Some babies form a heart, but not a brain - let me know your opinion on whether that is alive or not.\n\n*Anyway,* you want me to prove, essentially, is that a boulder doesn't in fact contain a tuba that is making the sound 'detected' by a machine built to detect the minute vibrations caused by ice expanding inside the boulder and outputs that vibration as tuba sounds. You're asking me to prove there ain't a sentient teacup in the sky.\n\nIf I was trying to sell you a lemon and demonstrated the engine firing up by banging on it, you'd call me out as an idiotic scummy saleswoman.",

That sound \"usually can't be heard with our Doppler machines until about 10 weeks.\"\n\nSo there you go. From your own source, at 10 weeks a fetal heartbeat can be detected, with \"fetal heartbeat\" being defined *by your own source* as:\n\".. the sound that I'm hearing is caused by the opening and closing of the cardiac valves\"\n\nSo at 10 weeks, the fetus has both the electrical system to beat a heart, and the requisite valves to have an actual \"lub-dub\" heartbeat rhythm. \n\nFine.

Fetal viability starts at around 23 weeks\nThe exact point that a fetus becomes viable has been debated for decades. \n\nThe ACOG \u2014 a leading medical authority on women's health and reproductive medicine \u2014 provides a range between 20 and 25 weeks of gestation calling this period \"periviable.\" During this window there is a high likelihood of death and near certainty of disability for the infant, says Verma. \n\nVariables including the fetus's size, sex, and access to medical care can impact chances of survival. Delivery this early also has additional complications for the birth parent, including increased likelihood of a cesarean delivery and increased risk for uterine rupture with future pregnancies. \n\nIt is possible for babies delivered at 23 weeks (about 5 months) gestation to live, but only about 5% will survive and practically all of those surviving infants will have morbidity, or medical complications other than death such as cerebral palsy and brain damage.\n\n\"Delivery before 23 weeks of gestation typically results in neonatal death,\" says Culver.\n\nBy 26 weeks, most premature infants will survive, but even these babies have increased risk for developmental and intellectual disabilities.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.insider.com/fetal-viability?amp",

In the case of a non-viable embryo, it cannot survive without its host, who should not be forced to care for it, so it can be aborted.

This is my personal opinion, but here goes:\n\nIf someone gets pregnant despite not wanting to, and they had reasonable belief that their \u201cprior actions\u201d could result in a pregnancy, then they should need to deal with the consequences of those actions (the pregnancy). We have contraceptives, Plan B, and medical procedures that can prevent pregnancy, and if those are ignored then having a child is a risk you\u2019re willing to take. There\u2019s also adoption if you really don\u2019t want it after birth.\n\nIn cases where a woman is not given a choice (forced upon, too young to understand, etc.), then I would understand 100% the decision to terminate, same as if they knew that the pregnancy posed a substantial risk to the life of the mother. But none of those scenarios are as callous to me as the, \u201cOops! lol I\u2019ll just abort it again, no worries!\u201d\n\nIf I go out to a bar, and I drink and drink, and I then get in my car, I am responsible for what happens when I hit the road. It doesn\u2019t matter how much I wanted to get home or how responsible I believed I was. If I hit someone, hurt them, or kill them, I have to deal with the consequences.\n\nIf I get angry and throw a rock into traffic, even if I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019ll never hit anything, I\u2019m responsible for my actions. If that rock hits, injures, or kills somebody, I have to live with the consequences.\n\nIf I, as a man, have unprotected sex with a woman I don\u2019t love, simply because I\u2019m in the mood, I have to deal with the consequences. If she gets pregnant, or I catch a disease, I have to live with the consequences. I can\u2019t tell the world I didn\u2019t know what I was doing. I can\u2019t tell them I don\u2019t want it anymore. I\u2019m stuck with the consequences of my actions. \n\nAnd all of those consequences are *well understood* to anyone mature enough to make those decisions, and those consequences are fair, because they are a natural risk of those decisions.",

If she gets pregnant, should she \u201cface her consequences\u201d by carrying a baby she doesn\u2019t want while living on the street without adequate nutrition, shelter, support, etc?

There are multiple industries and an entire facet of medical care solely or primarily supported by people preventing pregnancy and sexual disease. Clinics, colleges, and high schools often *give them away for free* to try and stop people from popping out kids they don\u2019t want. The problem is not a lack of options or the \u201cnecessity\u201d for abortions; the problem is people are having sex far more often than they\u2019re preparing for the consequences (by \u201cpreparing\u201d, I mean \u201cbuying condoms or spermicide\u201d).\n\nAnd if you can\u2019t afford condoms or pills or cream or patches or injections or can\u2019t manage to pull out in time, then you sure as hell can\u2019t afford an abortion, much less a child.\n\nBUT! If all of that fails, then maybe you could live in a state that allows you, without legal or financial consequence, to abandon your baby anonymously at a hospital, fire station, etc., where they\u2019ll be set up for foster care or adoption, and you can go on with your life knowing they\u2019re in somewhat good hands (or, not think about the kid at all; it\u2019s your choice).",

Almost every single person who supports abortion also supports contraception and the education to properly use contraception. No one would recommend getting an abortion instead of contraception.\n\nWhen we get to the territory of abortion debate, its because either a mistake was made, the circumstances that were previously favorable to pregnancy have changed, or someone was made a victim. It is never because someone said \"I anticipate getting pregnant and then having an abortion,\" because, like you said, that's not easier than contraception.\n\nReading your other comments, the only reason you're bringing it up is because of reason number one: mistakes were made. Your entire 'live with the consequences' argument can really be boiled down to the sentiment \"I think abortion is wrong.\"\n\nYou think it's more wrong than forcing a dumb 19 year old with a shitty support system and no job skills to have their entire life changed because of their mistake.\n\nBut at least you recognize that it's less wrong than forcing a rape victim to carry their rapist's baby.",

I believe I said that originally. And when you say \u201cno one would recommend getting abortion instead of contraception\u201d, you have to understand that there are all kinds of people in the world with all kinds of opinions, and some of the most vocal of those would dispute your claim. I\u2019ve seen all kinds of dumb opinions, some claiming birth control is a conspiracy by men to keep women in control or some crap, and while most of such examples are out in the fringes and not generally accepted, there are no absolutes here. You can\u2019t say \u201cnobody\u201d or \u201ceverybody\u201d because there will always be that one weirdo who pops up with a porcupine on their head claiming that the government should provide free heroine to children as a basic human right. \n\nIt\u2019s a crazy world out there. Crazier than most would believe. So if you want to rally against governments forcing women to have children, you should also look into places like Afghanistan, Syria, Iran, India, and so on, where girls are sold as brides the moment they hit puberty and literally forced to bear children against their will. And again, that\u2019s not a blanket statement, so you can probably find someone in India who didn\u2019t marry until they were 25 or someone from Syria who wasn\u2019t forced into an arranged marriage, but those atrocities are widely practiced there without much interference.",

              "text": "Let me give you some real life examples of why your logic does not work. Example #1 Have a cousin who had a child, she went on the pill and about 9 years went by and the pill stopped being effective (her body adjusted to the hormones) enter baby #2. After delivery doctor switched her to another contraceptive, 2 years later she had twins, she got her tubes tied. Example #2 A surprising variety of medications can actually reduce the effectiveness of birth control, everything from antibiotics to antidepressants. A woman catches pneumonia and takes an antibiotic, ends up pregnant, she was already on contraceptives but they didn't work. Several other examples: Many women cannot take oral contraceptives because they interact severely with mental health conditions like bipolar and schizophrenia, many women in these populations have unplanned pregnancies as a result. Myself as an example: Tried estrogen birth control pill while young, doctor said due to having migraines with aura my risk of stroke was 8x higher and stopped them, put me on progesterone only pills, I started having significant exacerbation of my bipolar symptoms and bleeding all the time. Tried the Mirena IUD, bleeding stopped but mood episodes worsened. Tried the non-hormonal paragard IUD and I ended up in the ER because my body partially expelled it. My options were basically natural family planning and condoms at that point. \n\nDid you know that men can basically walk into a clinic and schedule a vasectomy when they're 19 and doctors will do it but that women are denied the right to tie their tubes until they have several children or are in their 30s? My mom couldn't get her tubes tied until she had 3 kids, same happened to my cousin, the one who ended up with 4 kids. I see stories every day in the bipolar forum I am in of women who are severely sick with bipolar and completely overwhelmed with the children they already have and they cannot find a doctor willing to do a tubal because of their age or \"they only have 1 child.\" \n\nThe truth is that most of your arguments speak to punishing women for having sex, for being sexual creatures, for failed contraceptive efforts. Plan B doesn't always work and you have to know your contraception is failing to know to take it. Pregnancy can be a disabling condition, it can leave women extremely ill, it can lose them jobs and employment opportunities, and take away from their ability to provide for and care for their existing children. No one should be forced to continue a pregnancy against their will, to insist upon that is to relegate women to walking wombs where the fetus in their body has more rights than the woman does to her own autonomy.",

It isn\u2019t just women and their anatomy that are subject to severely neglectful policies in healthcare; I personally would have died if not for my family paying for health insurance, because I couldn\u2019t afford thousands of dollars for one test that proved my heart valve had calcified. I was given a six-week prognosis, and waited over four weeks for a donor and surgical team to replace the valve. Despite showing up at the hospital with symptoms and going to multiple doctors, I was always turned away without tests being done, until I was gifted health insurance. Then came the heart surgery that cost over $175K in total, 20% of which I was billed directly (the rest paid by insurance). And so, to your point, I do believe that much of our healthcare system is flawed, but it\u2019s not because there\u2019s some conspiracy or hatred toward women, or doctors and congressmen/women who want to punish women for getting pregnant. It\u2019s a systemwide issue that needs to be addressed as a whole.\n\nThat said, if you read above, you\u2019ll see I mentioned cases where the health of the mother is compromised by pregnancy. I also support other options that prevent pregnancy, but what I\u2019m against is the \u201cculture\u201d of sexual freedom without caring about the consequences, and the common rallying cry among many pro-choice individuals demanding abortions regardless of how far along they are or what the circumstances are. I hear arguments saying that women are \u201cbeing forced\u201d to have children, when a vast majority of them don\u2019t have the issues you mentioned, or any others, and continue treating abortion as their one and only prevention option despite over a dozen others being available.",

My wife had healthy pregnancies but they caused permanent changes to her body. My sister-in-law had difficult pregnancies that caused her to be anemic, but she and the babies ended up okay.\n\nIf a pregnancy is unwanted, I think it's inherently unconscionable to force a woman to carry it through in part because it's inherently a health issue.\n\n> I also support other options that prevent pregnancy, but what I\u2019m against is the \u201cculture\u201d of sexual freedom without caring about the consequences, and the common rallying cry among many pro-choice individuals demanding abortions regardless of how far along they are or what the circumstances are.\n\nI don't really think these \"cultures\" exist. In particular, I don't know where you get the idea that the \"vast majority\" of women having abortions (or any subset of them) treat abortion as their first option for both control and refuse to use any other measures. That's a common bogeyman that I've honestly never even heard of in real life. But, I will assume they do exist for the same of argument.\n\nRegardless of why a woman wants to terminate their pregnancy, though, the idea that it shouldn't be allowed because it lets women escape the consequences of having sex without taking whatever precautions seems, well, callous. As does the idea that a woman must have an acceptable reason for electively terminating a pre-viability pregnancy in general. A child should be wanted, not a consequence.",

Do you know of the experiments that proked parts of the brain to invoke reactions, smells, and memories? \n\nIt was pioneered by a Canadian surgeon named Penrose. In his decades of study, not one of his patients - in his words - agreed that he *made them do anything*. For instance, he could cause the patients arm to move by stimulating a certain part of the brain, but the patient would say something like \"I didn't move my arm. You moved my arm\".\n\nThat's very important. Penrose **never** found a part of the brain, that when stimulated electrically, *changed a person's mind*...mind control.\n\nMan, we are really off topic. Lol\n\nIf you're interested look into Penrose and physicist Wheeler etc. Some physicists think that quantum mechanics *necessitates* the existance of a \"conscious force\", for lack of a better term",

Sperm does that and sperm is prevented from entering the semen by vasectomies, but sperm is just one ingredient in semen. That said, yes, please encourage more men to get vasectomies and also allow women the right to choose about things that are a part of their body or dependent on it.",

Newsflash, birth control doesn\u2019t always work, condoms break, bodies get used to hormones, meds interfere with birth control efficacy, people get pregnant with IUDs in, rapes happen. None of that is relevant though, instead of crusading to force women to give birth why don\u2019t you go foster children from abusive homes, born addicted to drugs. Why don\u2019t you vote to provide universal childcare and preschool and medical care for all children?

But if the person in question died not because of what you did, but because of a pre-existing condition, then your crime would be mitigated. IE, if you give a fender bender to your neighbor who has a heart condition you don't know about, and they die, your charges will be much less, if they happen at all. Miscarriages can often happen very easily, so similar rules would likely apply. I guess the question is, if the baby was born and the same thing happened, what would the result be? Extrapolate, with leniency given for the relatively weaker state of the fetus, and you have your answer, all based in existing legal doctrine.\n\nAs for the second one, most laws allow exceptions when the life of the mother is at risk.

Nobody, not even scientists, knows where \"life\" starts and that entire definition is subjective, which is what we're discussing. \"Clearly wrong answers\" only include thing later than birth or even death, but even that's subjective because of lots of different religions.\n\nPoint is, yes, nobody knows what they're talking about.

At what stage of contraception and/or conception are you prohibiting human life from developing? Would causing children to be born increase human suffering?

But it does discredit them even further when it comes to their legitimacy in forcing their own poorly formed moral beliefs onto others.\n\nAs far as your other candidate ideas about what is \"more valid\" when deciding when human life gets rights, those are perfectly fine for you to consider when making your own choices.

The point I'm making is that the whole animal vs. human fetus identification thing is a weak argument that's detached from debating the actual moral/ethical implications of abortion.",

I don't think you can fault people for believing that human life starts at conception, therefore it should be protected and have rights. I also think if people were really pro-life, they would focus on improving material conditions for people and create a world where having a child wouldn't ruin you physically and financially, ergo reducing abortions by a considerable amount. That to me seems to be the strongest argument against pro-life because without improving material conditions, you're only creating more human suffering. \n\nAs for why I think the pig fetus argument ignores other contexts for pro-life, is because it's very much a \"gotcha\". \"Oh if you think protecting a fetus is so important, then why can't you tell what it looks like?\" I don't think visual identification plays any role into the pro-life argument (it doesn't seem like are a lot of people are saying that once it looks like a baby, it's alive. If they are, well that's also a weak argument, but again purely subjective). What does play a role is the arbitrary cutoff point where cells become human life. I think it's reasonable to think that once an egg is successfully fertilized, it has the potential to attach to the uterine wall, become a fetus, etc. then become a child. Interfering with that process could be considered murder to some.\n\nThere is some merit to calling out whether or not they think animal fetuses should also be protected, but again, I don't think pro-lifers or pro-choices are going to have views on animal vs. human rights that aren't on some level hypocritical.",

Your spit and jizz are your own DNA, with no viability to grow if given resources and energy, the jizz needs a completely seperate being of the opposite sex to make it viable. Once that happens, from the very first cell, it is genetically unique and individual to either parent, it has its own DNA that has never happened before, and when left in a natural state such as in the womb with e ergy and resources, will grow and take on new forms",

Just like the 'The AR-15 is not a weapon of war!' argument.  It is.  It's functionally identical to a weapon of war.  That's not all it is though, that doesn't make it any less of a sporting rifle.  It can be more than one thing.  The argument usually hinges around intended use and 'mah full auto'.  Listen, your ability to go pew pew pew erotically not withstanding, it's not intended to be used in full auto in service much either.  So that's basically a moot point. \n\nThat's not to say that the anti-gun community gets let off the hook either.  That side lies too.\n\n1.) No, most gun crimes aren't committed with the AR-15.  Most gun crimes are committed with handguns.  The news, political and media proliferation of the image of the mass shooter with the AR-15 is just statistically not accurate and is just designed to inspire fear of something that is infinitesimally rarely used in the events being talked about.\n\n2.) Ghost guns aren't as big of a problem as the administration would like you to believe.  This is a result of shifting goalposts.  Essentially, the government didn't like something, but that something actually happened so little that it would be seen as a waste to actually address.   Imagine if you had the alphabet, A through Z.  The definition of a 'Ghost Gun' was A.  Well... That's not enough... So let's actually also include B into the definition of ghost guns!  You know what, also C for good measure.  None of these things are actually what was considered 'ghost guns', it's just moving the goal post to include more things in what a ghost gun is so that it can be shown off as a bigger problem than it actually is.\n\nEssentially speaking, both sides are sort of being disingenuous about many, many arguments.  It's talking points, little tricks here and there, and lack of education and information on the subject.  \n\n\nEdit: Clarification, again.",

Otherwise they'd be up in arms when you cut your hair or trim your nail or remove a cyst or reduce breast size.  You're free to do all of that, you're also in the clear if a person ejaculate into your vagina but none of the sperms made it and the woman gets her period later.  There also won't be any issue if everyone sterilize themselves today and have all the sex they want there won't ever be pregnancy thus abortion becomes moot.  \n\nAs for the pro-abortion crowd, are you still considered pro-abortion or anti-abortion if you think aborting after first sign of brain activity or heartbeat should not be allowed?

It is not an easy answer but I fall back on my first rule, in this case, if it is not my body then I have no right to restrict it.

Lol.\n\nLet's be honest for two seconds here.\n\nThe person making the post clearly WANTED people to assume they were asking about abortion. That was the intent. Anyone who doesn't see that is either incredibly stupid, or incredibly dishonest.\n\n>if you take someone who has not been paying any attention to politics they most likely say no it's not human or what is that or not say anything at all.

Nothing about the nature if it is human or not.\n\nBut they still would have been wrong in their reading of the original question, which is the point that I am making.\n\nHow can people act like the responder is an idiot when they all made the exact same mistake.\n\nThis is tribalistic nonsense.\n\n\n>For me, something is human if it has human DNA, short and simple... I can have an opinion on it but it is their body, not mine.\n\nI'm not interested in this part of the debate right now.\n\nMy only interest is pointing out that the OP is a bullshit, cheap \"gotcha\" and doesn't mean anything and it's honestly embarrassing that so many people are cheering for this garbage.",

      "text": "this is actually an important point which is completely absent from the abortion debate. The fact is that there is no single defining point when an embryo becomes a \"human\". it is always human generically, but anatomically speaking, early human embryos are difficult to distinguish from fish, pigs, & embryos of other mammals until more differentiation occurs. that is to say that to abort an embryo at this stage is to take a life, but analogous to the life of the fish, pig, or mammal which the embryo most closely resembles based on its development. I'm not claiming this is hard science, just a useful analogy. every abortion is not \"killing a baby\", nor is it a choice thats completely free of moral culpability. abortion is taking a life - but taking the life of a 3 week old embyro is analogous to killing a fish, let's say. An abortion in the late second trimester might be analogous to killing a dog, and so on. Certainly there comes a point in fetal development where you're straight up killing a human and these procedures should be outlawed for any but the more extreme circumstances. Early abortions are much more about a woman's right to choose but an acknowledgement that this choice is not free from moral culpability is an important step towards finally coming to a resolution on this issue",

Nothing to panic about.  \n\nTrans women have a higher chance of being rape and assault victims than cis women do.  Forcing them to use the men's bathroom puts them more in danger than letting them into female restrooms does.  Like, you do realize that when that was in a fever pitch it was 90% cis women being harassed for not looking feminine enough?  It's stupid, you wanna do a genital check in bathrooms?  Wtf. If someone is acting creepy, regardless of gender, contact security or the police if you need to.  No need to go on the genitals safari.",

Glad we can agree on that at least.\n\nEverything else? Not expert in BPD, or really transgender people, but really? This tired argument about transgender women being a danger to women is seriously just wrong, and even if it were right, that would mean the people arguing it are aware that women's spaces are in some way being invaded, and have yet to do anything to actually make those places safer from, I don't know, other threats? Whenever I hear this argument it's always a kit transwomen being the threat, and how much women's spaces are in even more danger so what other threats are the people making these arguments talking about, and more importantly what are they doing to make these spaces safer besides pointing the finger at honest to God transwomen?",

I explained to you how seeing that your outrage stems from the potential for life, you jerking off to the Trump drawings you draw for yourself is also \u201ckilling children\u201d. You say it\u2019s different because it needs an egg. I ask again, **how does that make it different?** It **could have been a life**, but needed an egg. It would **develop into a living child** the same as a fertilized egg would. It\u2019s simply in an earlier stage in the process. So where do you draw this arbitrary line and what is it based on? Oh yeah, I forgot. It\u2019s still delusion. \n\nNeither a fertilized egg nor sperm outside of an egg/the egg itself are living human beings. You\u2019re outraged at the potential for life. Your Jordan Peterson induced gism has the potential to become a life given proper circumstances, **the same as a fertilized egg does.** So where is the difference? There is a reason you couldn\u2019t actually explain the difference. You can\u2019t. You\u2019re upset that you aren\u2019t equipped for this, but have too much pride to admit you\u2019re wrong and stop embarrassing yourself",

I am just saying let\u2019s not make this a binary conversation.\n\nSo your variety of questions/scenarios is exactly my point.

There is a difference between a rape victim and a 35 year old married person who decides they don\u2019t want a child. Maybe the married person should be legally allowed to abort, but to conflate the two scenarios into one decision point seems problematic to me\u2026",

It's not one of those things that is a major definitive argument in any debate on any subject, it just attacks the opponents position as someone knowledgeable on the subject to undermine the conclusions they have come to.\n\nThe points being made towards the replier are:\n\n* The subject makes you so emotionally charged you react without thinking\n* You dont know enough to realise it could be any embryo\n* What is and isn't human is subjective to you as well\n\nThats not gonna settle personhood versus non-personhood once and for all, but it is a good set of perspectives if the actual question isn't 'is it a person?' and is actually 'What should the law be?'",

Both are more biased opinion statements than medical facts.\n\nSo the chuckle here is simply a backhanded play on the lying methodology which the anti-self-control crowd often uses in their marketing materials.

Rebutting those proxy arguments is a waste of time, because they don't care if the excuses are true or not.  Their actual motive is to use unwanted pregnancy to punish women for enjoying sex.

This is because the federal government never actually wrote it into law guaranteeing it- they basically fell back in the courts interpretation that it was a right. When overturned individual states will effectively have the right to ban the procedure if they choose. Some will exercise their new rights and ban or severely limit their availability. \n\nThis has obviously angered some people and ignited the abortion debate to a more extreme level. So Nate posted a picture of this pig embryo asking if people consider it a human being. It's designed as a trap for pro-lifers. They believe that life begins at conception so the blurred person says \"yes\" assuming it's a human embryo. So when Nate reveals it's a pig embryo it's supposed to make the pro-life person look like they don't fully understand what they're advocating for. \n\nOverall the meme is pointless. Nate specifically picked a pig embryo because at this stage they look incredibly similar to a human embryo so unless you have a degree in biology or medicine it's highly unlikely any person on either side of the aisle would be able to differentiate between the two.",

You literally compared an embryo to a germ, which means you're putting them on the same level, so if \"germs are alive therefore embryos are babies\" is true then \"killing an embryo is killing a baby, therefore killing a germ is killing a baby\" must *also* be true.",

Abortion is not and was never meant to be a contraception method, if you want to avoid any nasty surprise after unprotected sex, the only thing to do is to take the morning-after pill ffs.\n\nThis, is what an aborted 12 weeks foetus looks like :\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/J83jD6E.gif](https://i.imgur.com/J83jD6E.gif)\n\nand this is what abortion past 20 weeks looks like :\n\n[**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HslaMej6TlA&ab\\_channel=LiveAction**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HslaMej6TlA&ab_channel=LiveAction)\n\n**You just can't seriously think it's a good idea to allow such practice past a certain amount of weeks.**",

This is constantly the avenue for attack for making abortion terms shorter, like Texas's 6 week ban (which has no exceptions for rape)\n\nE.g. \"The reason that we chose 15 weeks is because at that point in development in the baby, they have the ability to feel pain, they have bone structure, they have fingernails, they have begun the sex organs\"\n\n\\- Florida State Senator Stargel arguing for tighter restrictions based on appeals to the traits of the embryo, not its potential.",
