Instead of going up THREE steps, they chose to take the hill down to the basement, then proceed to take an elevator that went from the ground floor and the 1st floor only, walk to the other side of the building and take another elevator from the 1st to the 2nd floor where they worked. One day the elevator broke before lunch. They were trapped because they would not walk down the steps. One of them actually said \u201cHow are we supposed to eat?\u201d",
