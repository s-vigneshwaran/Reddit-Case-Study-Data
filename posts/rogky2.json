If the rainfall is somewhat even over the trip, then in any given moment we can assume that any volume of air's amount of rain drops will stay somewhat constant. So if we look at a vertical plane that moves through the path we take, it'll always bump into the same number of rain drops, no matter how quickly it moves. But a horizontal plane that moves through the area will pick up more rain drops the longer it's outside, no matter how or where it moves.  \nSo, vertical portions of you: Doesn't matter, you'll get the same amount of rain by \"walking into it\".  \nHorizontal portions of you: Will pick up rain proportionally to how long you're in the rain.  \nAnd since higher speed reduces time spent in the rain, higher speed means less wet.",

How fast you are moving. \n\nTo get the least bit wet there is an optimal speed, and what that is can be mapped out on a graph, with speed of rain on one dimension let\u2019s say the X axis. And how fast you are moving along the Y axis. The optimal speed for both variables is an exponential incline.\n\n// \n\nThe basic reasoning is if it is sprinkling, walking is better. \n\n//The total surface area that is getting hit by water is increased the faster you move. \n\nif it is pouring, running is better. \n\n//the longer you are in the rain the faster you get drenched, the rate of which is greatly increased past the point of any difference in surface area to be hit. \n\n//\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure Vsauce did a video about this years ago, but idr",

So,\u00a0[according to MinutePhysics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MqYE2UuN24), you should minimise this by running like a person in the rain without a raincoat.\"",

And somewhat tricky.\n\nSo we can assume that rain falls at a steady rate (I know it doesn't always but for just right now let's assume), meaning that in the time it takes for one drop to move a certain distance a new drop will have taken its place. So what this means is that if you move out of the way of one drop unless you're moving under shelter than another drop will hit you so it doesn't matter how fast you go since you will always simply be walking into the next drop rather than actually avoiding something. So no matter how fast we go we will always be hit by X drops a second.\n\nBut what does matter is time. Let's assume that X is our last part was 5 any number works but we will use this one for now for ease of use. That means for every second out there no matter what I do I'm getting hit with 5 drops a second and 300 a minute. Which means that even though running faster won't change the drops I get hit by per second, it can effect time spent in the rain which will have an impact on the total 'wetness'.\n\nSo speed it self doesn't effect how much rain hits you but time does and time is somewhat effected by speed, but in a hypothetical situation that two people are outside for the same amount of time and one runs and the other walks they will both be equally wet.",

Basically, if you are walking and hit by 100 raindrops per minute and it will take you 10 minutes to walk there, you will get hit with about 1000 raindrops. If running will make it take 5 minutes, but the increased speed makes 200 raindrops hit you per minute, then you will also get hit with 1000 raindrops. Basically, wetness = rate of rain * time in rain, and it should be roughly constant regardless of speed.",

When the clerk gave me the high sign to see if I would respond with the appropriate countersign to receive the white people discount (I know everybody think stuff is free for us and forget that we're cheap and I'm not supposed to disclose it but 5% is 5%, amiright?)  \n\n\nAnyway, the clerk gave me the umbrella, a coupon for free grits,  AND handed my white people card back.

She was born some time between the 2320s and 2330s in universe, and the show takes place in the 2370s. Bloomington doesn\u2019t factor into the story much since it takes place on a ship 70,000 light years away, but Voyager can be a comfy and optimistic show to watch anyway so I would recommend it.",

                                  "text": "I highly recommend watching this series. I'm not recommending it as someone who has watched \"Star Trek\" since \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" premiered in the 1980s -- I'm recommending it to you as someone who is just fascinated with how all-over-the-place \"Star Trek: Voyager\" is with in regards to writing and characterization.   \n\n\n\"Star Trek: Voyager\" was \"1990s diverse\" with a female captain (who was, of course, still white^(1)) and an ethnically diverse crew of stereotypes. The basic premise of the show is that the ship -- the U.S.S. Voyager -- is pulled 70,000 light years across the other side of the galaxy in an instant, leaving the crews of this ship and a ship full of rebels who had been fighting against another government both stranded and trying to get \"home\" on the Voyager. This was supposed to leave the storytelling open to tales of strife amongst the two crews and limited supplies, but this soon drops by the wayside and everyone is one big, happy Starfleet family in no time with only occasional references to supply shortages as a plot device. The near endless supply of shuttles that the Voyager has is almost a running joke, and the ship's torpedoes also seem to have the infinite ammo cheat activated despite the fact that the crew states early in the show that they have a limited number and that the torpedoes cannot be replicated on the ship. Episodes include such absurdities as the captain and her jack-of-all-trades helmsman being turned into salamanders and breeding, and taking time off from the long trek home to partake in a shuttlecraft space race because ... yeah, you'll be numb to it if you make it that far into the series. Eventually, the captain has sex with a hologram on the holodeck the crew uses for escapist recreation -- that's an entire episode. Not the sex scene, thank the gods, but I'm sure someone has made an actual porn version of it by now.  \n\n\nOn the whole, Captain Kathryn Janeway (as portrayed by Kate Mulgrew, a capable actress who has since admitted she was phoning in her performance as Janeway for the paychecks and who has a voice that makes you wonder if she smokes cigarettes or eats them) is written so inconsistently that she comes across as mentally ill -- her character was the first female captain who was a lead in her own show (Star Trek has always been progressive, and I'm sure that there were plenty of female captains in guest roles before then, but I'm not a hardcore Trekkie who can spout off episodes like that), but it would almost seem like the writer's room had a subconscious misogynistic vendetta against the character. The first officer, Chakotay, is a Native American whose one note is to spout off new-agey mumbo jumbo that was based on, if I recall correctly, the advice of an \"expert\" on Native American culture who was a complete fraud. The chief engineer is the \"crazy latina\" stereotype, but they cover it up (literally, with makeup) by making her half-human (that half is, yes, Latina) and half-Klingon (a hot-blooded alien warrior race whose culture is so absolutely stupid under even the slightest scrutiny that it defies logic that they could advance past living in caves due to their need to kill each other at the slightest excuse). \"The Doctor\" is an Emergency Medical Hologram -- a sentient computer program with a keen interest on exploring what it means to be human, and he was probably such an interesting character to a lot of people because those people are probably, like myself at the time \"Voyager\" was originally broadcast, undiagnosed autistics. There's a freshly minted ensign on the bridge who rarely gets the chance to do anything but ensign stuff for seven years and comes across as the most milquetoast of suburban white American kids despite him being Korean-American^(2). There's an alien junk trader (who you'll either like or learn to absolutely f\\*cking despise) and his underaged love interest of another species that lives an extremely short life of only a few years before disappearing from acting altogether and putting in much more interesting performances in her local police blotter. Eventually the petite, underaged alien is replaced with a cyborg in a catsuit that leaves nothing to the imagination, at which point the show becomes less of an ensemble and more of a back and forth between the captain and said cyborg. At this point in the show you'll be able to Google and find that there's 20+ years worth of lesbian fanfic and Rule 34 DeviantArt level stuff of the two. Last, but very much not least, is the helmsman whose characterization started as that of a pilot so gifted that he was released on parole from prison to pilot the U.S.S. Voyager and progressed over the course of the series into something of a polymathic genius who is, arguably, a \"Mary Sue\" (and he is also, of course, the only white^(3) male human in the main cast -- \"The Doctor\" not counting as he is a sentient program that just appears as a white male).  \n\n\nOh, and I almost forgot that there's also a Vulcan (Spock, but black) security officer whose performance is so wooden that you'll worry he might get space termites. His most memorable line is \"We ain't found shit\". That's not in this show, mind you, but from Mel Brooks's \"Spaceballs\" (1987).  \n\n\nThe thing that makes a runthrough of \"Star Trek: Voyager\" a great thing to do, in my experience, is watching Chuck Sonnenburg's reviews of each episode at [SFDebris.com](https://SFDebris.com). I won't say that Chuck *hates* this show, but he does vent his spleen all over it. I can say that he hates Neelix, the alien junk trader. He hates this character so much that Chuck often makes comparisons to Neelix in reviews of non-Star Trek shows. \n\nGive it a go. You'll either keep watching \"Voyager\" because you love it, or you'll keep watching \"Voyager\" because you love to hate it. To each his own.\n\nBut seriously, fuck Neelix.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n^(1) *Before every Trekkie on* r/facepalm *and* r/all *jumps up my arse,  I'm aware that a black man (Avery Brooks as Benjamin Sisko) had been the lead on \"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\" for two years at the time of the ST:VOY premiere. Benjamin Sisko was still a commander at that time, not yet having been promoted in-universe to captain (with the weak in-universe explanation that space station commanders held the rank of, in the most literal sense, commander) despite the real world pressure from fans who were of the mindset that the real reason the character wasn't a captain had more to deal with real world Hollywood suits not wanting to trigger racist snowflakes.*\n\n  \n^(2)*Source for Harry Kim being Korean-American is Garrett Wang, the actor who portrayed the character.*  \n\n\n^(3)*For clarification, I am also a white male human. I absolutely could not care less that someone's ancestors came from the same continent as mine.*  \n\n\n*If you've read this far, then CONGRATULATIONS! I am, obviously, really f\\*cking bored.*",

Time and the horrors hes seen can do alot to a man, and its not really that far off from the characterization in first contact imo.

If they were ok the benefitted side, they wouldn't lift a finger, if not endorse inequality\" because those few people are not interested in doing the right thing, they would not fight bad things of it doesn't improve their own life's, and the only reason they are fighting it now is because they are not on the profiting side\n\nIf the shoe was on the other side they wouldn't lift a finger. Not all people fighting inequality are like that, obviously, but some are\n\nI don't know where you got the \"we should just racial profile people\" part, unless you are looking to start a fight out of boredom so you make up a reason",

Just that the argument you're making, that it's a lost cause, would lead to just racial profiling all the time.

Colonization is a natural process of evolution in nature. Nothing new here. The human race spread throughout the world and overlapped repeatedly, sometimes peacefully in cohabitation and other times in wars of expansionism (colonization). Tribal conflicts have occurred all over the world for thousands of years. European, Asian, African and American tribes have been colonizing one another since before recorded history as the archeologists have been discovering. All of our ancestors have had blood on their hands at some time in history. When someone from a Black community tries to point out that specifically White people have blood on their hands they conveniently ignore all the blood on their own races hands. In fact there are ample records of White Colonialists in Africa stopping Black inter tribal wars and canabalism against other Black and Khoi San tribes. The Blacks sanctimonious holier than thou attitude towards Whites is total hypocrisy. In South Africa the Blacks have killed 20 times more Blacks since Mandela\u2019 Black ANC Government came to power  than the Whites ever Killed Blacks under Colonial rule and Apartheid. But the Media is totally silent on those statistics because it doesn\u2019t gel with their anti- White agenda. The massacre and torture of innocent Whites by Blacks in South Africa is mind boggling, far worse than Apartheid statistics but the world is silent on the Black genocide going on every day against Whites in South Africa. If you want to know what is fueling White Nationalism World wide, just look at the constant attacks both physically, verbally, in print and in the Media and on Social media against Whites. Neither I nor my Ancestors going back at least Five hundred years have owned slaves or shed any Black lives but you want to place me and my ancestors into you generalization of my \u201cWhite\u201d race. I blame the Democrat party and their followers of creating \u201crace hatred against Whites\u201d with their non stop propaganda against our race. I wonder if the Democrats ever understand that statement by M. L. King can work both ways. \u201c I dream of the day when a man (or woman) can be judged on the content of their character, and not on the color of their skin (be it White, Black, Yellow, Red, Brown). Get educated not propagandatised.",

They demand that free things be given to people who belong to groups that have 'historical grievances', which in every example given by CRT adherents is for non-white demographics to demand stuff from white people.\n\nDespite the fact that those same groups were victims of other groups, often to a far higher degree and also despite the fact that historically white people have suffered at the hands of many, many different non-white groups and cultures.\n\nCRT is historically illiterate and ignorant, and is based on lies, collectivist thinking and petulance.\n\nOne example of a lie they tell is by trying to link modern day policing to slave patrols in the US. This is untrue in the extreme both in the US and elsewhere.\n\nModern policing the the UK is traces back to Sir Robert Peel (no relation at all to the slave trade), with most European police systems being variations on that.\n\nIn the US, social scientists and the then-newly created posts of 'criminologists' advocated for a full time professional force in the early 1800's to deal with an explosion in the crime rate driven by the fact more and more people were flocking to the cities due to the industrial revolution. The oldest police forces in the US are, as far as I can find, are in northern non-slaving states and the oldest police forces specifically are the New York, Cincinnati, Philadelphia and Boston police forces, with Boston being the first (established 1838).\n\nThe more you read, the more CRT starts to look like a bad joke and the more you realise that its full of lies.",

First of all, my exact words were \"I'd rather not rub elbows with racist, condescending pedophiles with no money than sense\". Not \"I'd rather not rub elbows with rich people because they are all racist, condescending pedophiles, etc.\" There are some people who are rich/famous/successful and don't go off and abuse their power and money. They aren't the people I'm referring to.  I am referring to a subset of rich people that treat poor people like shit, harbor racist views, and have potentially spent at least one vacay on Jeffery Epstein's private island.\n\nSecondly, there is a big difference between my statement and racism, and that is I am not giving someone hate for something they can't control. You can't control being born black, or Mexican, or white. I don't hate people for the color of their skin and their place of birth because that is something that they do not control. \n\nHowever, youu can stop being racist and condescending at any time. You can stop diddling underage girls and turn yourself in, at any time. You can stop being someone with more money than sense at any time, either by learning some common sense or letting go of your money. The kind of people you claim I am discriminating against are the way they are because of the choices they made. Choices that I might add are actively hurting others, and they choose to continue in spite of the harm that they are causing. They are every bit worthy of derision, and your decision to lump my views of them with their views of our Mexican friend is a logical fallacy of the highest order.",

I don't propose just willy nilly exposing yourself to something so dangerous as uncontained dihydrogen monoxide. But I did my own research, and I'm going to take my chances.",

We know for sure that there were a LOT of people who were against the enslavement of people. So, some people used their power to spread propaganda that a subset of those people\u2014the Africans\u2014were not actually human. And a lot of people believed this propaganda, as disproving propaganda was not nearly as simple back then as it is today.\n\nNow, imagine what kind of society could potentially emerge from generations upon generations of people passing down those beliefs using their own authority as elders. One might end up with a society where people of African descent are treated as subhuman. Some might treat them as toxic and litigate who is allowed to procreate with them, or the water they are allowed to drink, or the places they are allowed to merely exist. Some might merely hold deep-seated biases where they unconsciously view those people as more animalistic: less able to control their impulses, lacking intellect, and thus being less relatable. And some might use all of that to further their personal goals, knowing very well that it's all false, but seeing it as a shortcut to enrich themselves, their families, or even their country.\n\nThe \"guilt\" is understanding that you benefit from a past evil, regardless of your personal participation in it.",

Yes as with white only pools reducing the access, it's so much more complex than \"it's cuz of racism\". Again, I'm not saying racism has nothing to do with this, the low class thing is real, but people tend to strawman these kinds of arguments by accusing the other person of completely discounting ANY amount of racism, even after specifically saying it is a factor, but there are other factors you shouldn't ignore. \n\n\"Why do they not have problems getting their hair wet unless it's braided?\". Exactly, styles like braided hair go back a VERY long time and are largely popular in the black community. Why are you just completely discounting all the people who do have braided hair?? I suggest you research that. There is huge cultural significance in passing down the historical knowledge of hair styles from parents to children. There are things like maintaining natural hair oils that can be a large issue for some people, thus not wanting to get their hair wet. There is a culture of changing your hair styles a lot, if you JUST spent time styling your hair you probably wouldn't want to risk ruining a brand new look. If you spent a long time getting a fro looking just right you probably wouldn't want to risk it turning into dreads(an issue for a lot of Jewish people as well, although the puffy afro isnt quite as common). \n\nThere is this attitude that is far too prevalent today where people are desperate to wallow in their precieved trauma. They would rather blame everyone else for the world around them rather than focusing on being a stronger person. I have a friend who recently got obsessed about genetic trauma. And while it is VERY interesting how nature works, he is simply using it as fuel for his hate and using it as an excuse to not try.",

How do Americans even understand that most racist motivated genocides through history has been between people who the US census would consider part of the same \"race\"?",

Even then, slave trade in the USA only picked up after the invention of the cotton gin (1793) and ended in 1863. So there was significantly less than 100 years of cotton plantations in the USA. There just isn't a way to distribute 12.5 million people across that timeline and make any reasonable sense.",

But they proved too violent to be allowed to remain in Africa and were exiled to the caucus mountains and they teach that that\u2019s the reason for white peoples being called caucasians. They teach that white people then lived in caves and interbred with dogs and that white people are still born with tails which are removed at birth. They teach that white people are subhumans who are violent by nature and must be completely eradicated. \n\nOther groups like the black Hebrew Israelites teach that African Americans are descended from the lost tribe of Israel who were all enslaved and shipped to America to sever their link to God and the holy land. They claim that actual Jews are all black and that what we refer to as \u201cJewish\u201d people are called jew-ish because they are imitations of Jews, not actual Jews. They claim that they\u2019re white europeans who stole the holy land from black people and our history books and things like the holocaust are false history to trick black peoples from ever reconnecting with God and inheriting the Earth as his chosen people. They also call for the deaths of all white people. \n\nMany of these groups teach all kinds of dumb theories which misunderstand the origins of words to reinforce their beliefs. For instance, they say that the word \u201chuman\u201d comes from the word \u201chue\u201d (meaning colored, according to them) and \u201cman\u201d. So only colored people are humans, white peoples are not. Despite the fact that the word \u201chuman\u201d predates the word \u201chue\u201d by quite a lot. Lots of dumb stuff like this which originates from a place of ignorance but anyone who denies it is trying to spread white peoples false history. It\u2019s really quite a rabbit hole.\n\nThese are very basic sources but it goes very deep if you are interested enough to research it yourself: \n\n[info on the NOI](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/nation-islam)\n\n[info on black Hebrew Israelites ](https://www.adl.org/resources/backgrounders/extremist-sects-within-the-black-hebrew-israelite-movement)",

My mentor and best friend, someone I even consider a father figure in many respects, is a 60 year old black man. He and I have listened to Farrakhan\u2019s radio programs together before. The Nation of Islam has a very wide each and while many people probably don\u2019t agree with their more extreme beliefs, they definitely have a sizable place within black American culture. They were probably at their peak influence around the time of the civil rights movement when Malcolm X was active in the NOI, but they\u2019re still out there and are still getting press and acknowledgement within mainstream black culture. Just off the top of my head I can think of probably 15-20 huge hip hop acts who mention teachings of NOI and black Hebrew Israelites in their music, even people as recent and relevant as Killer Mike, Kendrick Lamar, 2 Chainz, Jay Z, etc. And people like Farrakhan are regularly getting interviews with people like Sway and The Breakfast Club. These groups are likely a lot more mainstream within black culture than most nonblack Americans would assume.",

They say \u201cslavery bad\u201d at some point and talk about how Lincoln freed them, and that\u2019s that. And I had a black us history teacher. There are excerpts and stuff I remember, they talk about Harriet Tubman, etc, but it is portrayed more like being forced to work hard with horrible punishments than the genocide that it was. \n\nAnd what is even your point? That there was domestic slavery before white people globalized it? All slavery is bad, but the reason that the transatlantic slave trade was so much worse is because it ripped people from their culture, and they ceased being people. That\u2019s the massive difference. In Africa, you may have been a slave, but you still had a history, you had roots. You were still a person. It\u2019s still awful, and unacceptable, but compared to going to America? You\u2019re more like a horse or ox, lol, literally looked on like an animal that can talk.\n\nWhich leads into 2. \u201cWhite\u201dness exists to distinguish from blackness. \u201cWhite\u201d isn\u2019t even an ethnic group inside the us, ethnic groups are \u201cItalian\u201d or \u201cGerman\u201d or \u201cIrish\u201d. That why there is no such thing as \u201cwhite culture\u201d because the concept of whiteness only exists to distinguish the class of the \u201cin-group\u201d from the others.\n\nBlackness is the exact opposite. When you were taken from Africa, you stopped being nigerian, or Ethiopian, or whatever you ethnically identified as. Instead, you were put into the class of being \u201cblack\u201d, a lower class. Modern \u201cblackness\u201d exists specifically because American black peoples have no other culture or ethnicity to call back on. Almost every \u201cblack\u201d person in America descends from a slave brought from across the Atlantic and stripped completely of their culture. Those that don\u2019t?\n\nThey get to call themselves Haitian, or Jamaican, or African etc, because you\u2019re right, in most parts of the world your shared history and culture is from where your family grew up in the last 20 generations or w/e, and not formed from practically a blank slate that started in abject poverty.\n\nThat IS American black peoples shared history by the way. That\u2019s why in America that \u201cwhiteness\u201d or \u201cblackness\u201d matters so much. Because \u201cwhiteness\u201d in America historically represents oppression, and that\u2019s the only \u201cculture\u201d they share, whereas black people represent the oppressed, and they had to build their culture from the ground up out of that oppression",

If the poster thinks that they should (instead of just making a joke about the incredibly imperialistic history of europeon nations) then that's not something I agree with at all, full stop. Obviously people born in the modern generation had nothing to do with slavery. \n\nWith that clarified, I still think when looking at history that the global impact of europeon imperialism is far greater than any empire before it, as well as being incredibly recent relatively. I think that's pretty clearly what's being referenced, and while the 'white' umbrella has widened dramatically in the past century or so (meaning that many of the 'white' people of today would not have been considered 'white' a while back), I think it's just a joke referencing the american who identifies solely as 'white' and the history involved there.\n\nAs far as slavery goes, the magnitude is also absolutely different, and that's the point I'm trying to make. I really don't want to go down a rabbit hole trying to draw comparisons between a bunch of objectively horrific practices and imply that one group is better or worse because they did x or y. But if you're talking numbers and efficiency, yes, europeons did it better than anyone else.\n\nEven after importing slaves had been banned, the numbers of slaves in the US still multiplied, because they were being bred and sold off. This is why I make the distinction, historically groups would capture slaves, then use them/sell them. The US stopped needed to do even that, it's just on a different level. \n\nRegardless, again, there's no reason a white person today needs to feel guilty for slavery, the same way we don't hold germans today accountable for the actions of nazis. (bc that would be dumb)",

Yes, some were able to rise to the level of the elite/wealthy, that didn't mean that they were considered on the same level as English whites.\n\nHere is the Benjamin Franklin quote.\n\n\"Why should Pennsylvania, founded by the   English, become a Colony of Aliens, who will shortly be so numerous as   to **Germanize us instead of our Anglifying them, and will never adopt our   Language or Customs, any more than they can acquire our Complexion**. \n\n24. Which leads me to add one Remark: **That the Number of purely   white People in the World is proportionably very small.** All Africa is   black or tawny. Asia chiefly tawny. America (exclusive of the new   Comers) wholly so. And **in Europe, the Spaniards, Italians,   French, Russians and Swedes, are generally of what we call   a swarthy Complexion; as are the Germans also, the Saxons only   excepted, who with the English, make the principal Body of White People   on the Face of the Earth**. I could wish their Numbers were increased. And while   we are, as I may call it, Scouring our Planet, by clearing   America of Woods, and so making this Side of our Globe reflect a   brighter Light to the Eyes of Inhabitants in Mars or Venus, why should   we in the Sight of Superior Beings, darken its People? why increase the Sons of   Africa, by Planting them in America, where we have so fair an   Opportunity, by excluding all Blacks and Tawneys, of increasing the lovely   White and Red? But perhaps I am partial to the Complexion of my Country, for   such Kind of Partiality is natural to Mankind.\n\n[This is the definition of swarthy:](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/swarthy) : of a dark color, complexion, or cast\n\nThis is the quote I'm referencing to as to the feelings of 'whiteness' from those that aren't of anglo-saxon descent (which is what 'white' orignally meant.) So if that quote isn't real or something, I would love for you to clarify that for me so that I have a better understanding of the situation. \n\nI feel that poll can be partially misleading because 'Latinx' in the singular sense refers to yourself. Even if you are one of the quarter or so that knows the term, you are much more likely to refer to yourself as hispanic. Even if you use the Latino/a terms, then you would refer to yourself in the gender that you are - that is, latino or latina. \n\nlatinx is a gender-neutral term, so naturally if you identify as a man or as a woman, then you would rather not be referred to as it. The main time you'd call yourself 'latinx' is if you are gender neutral. But if you're speaking about a group, a gender-neutral term would be appropriate. \n\nFor example, if there was a survey about how many people refer to themselves as they/them, you would get very low numbers, and many people would probably say that they'd be offended if someone referred to them as they/them.\n\nI've also found information about some of the concerns being in the Americanization of the word, and some of the concerns being about the 'latin' side of it as it excludes of other descents, and issues about the term 'latin america' being rooted in colonialism itself, so it's definitely something I'll have to do more research on to make sure I'm being respectful.

The difference is that American slavery was done at an industrial level and the transatlantic trade created more demand for slavery and for future conflict in African societies.\n\nPublic schools *are* taught that Africans sold slaves to Europeans, it's not glossed over, it's just not very relevant to the Civil War and American slavery. American slavery was industrial level, farm level trade. 20 million people kidnapped over the history of the slave trade (not all went to the US). Meanwhile the USA's worst war as far as casualties was fought over the agency to keep and hold slaves.\n\nSystemic racism is still here to this day, Reconstruction was a failure. Redlining is still happening. Black people will, for instance, have to \"white wash\" if they want to avoid their homes being lowballed, stuff like that. It's happening, in 2021. People like OP's twitter post will of course be completely over the top in their criticisms, but it's only so that they signal boost. Because that's what we do these days.",

I have multiple times been directly \u201cinsulted\u201d because of my race (I\u2019m black), the n word (both forms) was a typical punchline for my 9th grade high school class, was it offensive? Yes, but I knew my friends and I knew they respected my opinions and thoughts equally to any other persons thoughts, so I was not offended even if the joke consisted of offensive material. \n\nThis tweet read as offensive to me, and I was offended. Why? Because the premise seems ridiculous, and I have no idea about how the author of the tweet treats the topic of colonialism with nuance.",

That doesn't say anything?\n\nMaybe most people aren't dumb enough to make it about walking in the rain, but anti-White racism absolutely is the most acceptable form of racism nowadays and *is* growing in prevalence. It's also the only one that goes mostly unpunished. White people aren't allowed to be concerned about this because...? If racism towards any other race exhibited similar tendencies, it'd be an immediate national emergency.",

The terrorist who ran over all of those White people in Waukesha had hateful and violent anti-White rhetoric on his Facebook page. Barely a peep about it in the media, not called a hate crime, not called a terrorist incident, etc. What would have happened if you had reversed the races?\n\nSorry, but you're being naive.

Or, let me guess, the only time that has ever occurred, and being overblown. \n\nThe left does absolutely nothing better than infighting and alienating allies. Wtf have you been? If you can't even acknowledge that there are problems within your own ranks, you can't start fixing them. Like I said, constantly telling the largest group of people within your ranks, who you can't win elections without, that they are pieces of shit who aren't allowed to have opinions, is surely a winning strategy. And those on the fence, who aren't loyal to your side? Certainly this is an attractive sales pitch to them. \n\nAs for the issues, the Dems are failing miserably on them because the Dems are spineless, incompetent cowards, who let the Republicans constantly kick them in the dick with no consequences. Sure, the economy is doing well, for more people. But that can be reversed back to an economy that is doing well, but only for the very few at the top, as soon as the right gets power again. What are you doing that will last? What are you doing to preserve women's body autonomy? What are you doing to balance out the SC after McConnell made y'all his bitch and stole a seat, and then trump, donald goddamn trump of all people, got to swat THREE justices that will secure the right real, lasting power for decades? What are y'all doing about the filibuster? What are you doing to preserve voting rights? To protect our democratic process and institutions from the next 4 year assault on them? Not shit. \n\nSo you are failing there, *and* constantly alienating multiple groups of your allies. Y'all are gonna get fucking wrecked in the next midterms, and in 2024. And that's a goddamn shame. Because I'm afraid America as we know it won't survive the next attempt to undermine democratic institutions, throw out the votes, destroy our system of checks and balances, and make a reality tv show carnie grifter and his family into dictators or monarchs.",

There are people who let their kid die of easily treatable illnesses, like an infected tooth, ffs, because they say their god won't let them visit doctors, and they are free to do so. Y'all still fight scientific progress that would save/improve lives. Likely my own some day. See: stem cell research. Y'all still fight against rights for gays in places where they haven't yet secured them. My local governments are full of people who are 100% evangelical \"Christian.\" So is my state. It starts to thin out nationally, but it's still mostly Christian. They don't turn it off when they start governing. Y'all don't operate that way. It works its way through everything you do. Including legislating. I can't buy certain things on Sundays because y'all made that law here, because it's your church day. Hell, there are entire counties where it's illegal to even possess alcohol down here, because the religious leaders in that town wanted it. I've worked as a deputy in one, and locked people up for it. I could keep going. But, see, as a straight white guy, the way y'all force it on me is not nearly as bad as the way you force it on women and gays, for example. And I'm not selfish.

After that, it's a situation where some churches over here do good. These over here don't. I've always said that the world would be a much better place if Christians were more Christlike, instead of just throwing his name around. But y'all don't these days. Not as a whole. And don't feel like I'm singling out your religion here. Religion as a whole is the worst self inflicted wound humanity has ever given itself, imo. How many wars can be traced to some kind of religious hatred or bias in our history? How much scientific advancement has been delayed and suppressed in our history? Religions have been persecuting people who were too smart, advanced things a little too much, since they would punish you for saying the earth isn't flat. Probably longer, actually. All the way to persecuting Turing for being gay, to hindering scientific research and advancement today. \n\nIt's just a vastly disproportionate net negative, imo. Again, not only your religion. I know the wokes have made it where yours can be mocked, but other ones can't. I'm not like that. Thing is, all the stuff religion professes to do greatly for humanity, like giving a good moral framework, you absolutely, 100% do *not* need religion for. You don't need to think some god will punish you in order to be a good person. In fact, it seems to be a hindrance to being decent to other people these days. Y'all do some good in your immediate vicinity, but support that absolute *worst* scumbags on the state and national level. I'm not a democrat, so this isn't a biased perspective. I'm a true independent, who voted Republican many times in the past, but never will again, until all these traitors and trump worshipping cultists get out. And I'm telling you, y'all support some vile people. Of course not all of you, but the majority. And you support policies that keep the most people poor, the fewest people with all the money, wars over healthcare. Claiming to care about life while doing your damndest to make the most people struggle to get by as possible. Not through your religion. Through the politicians your religion mobilizes for. \n\nI could go on, with what I see as the negatives, but I've been sick, and I'm not feeling well atm, so I kinda want to turn my mind off for a bit, with lighter aubjecta and shorter responses. I love the ideals of your Christ though, man. I just don't see them manifest in reality, outside of helping out with issues in your immediate local area.",

Prisoners today make obnoxiously low wages to produce food, work in telemarketing, fight wildfires. In Africa it was most common to be an indentured servant who has a fixed limit on the time served for being a POW. Meanwhile, working the fields with the possibility of buying your freedom or giving a share of your work to build towards that. Europeans decided Africans are less than human to justify beliefs that go against their religion. This led to discrimination based on skin color and in turn made Africans property as opposed to prisoners. America had to scale back once this belief was illegal to implement and revert to the way Africans had treated their subjects",

African slavery was for the most part not unlike in contemporary Medieval Europe, with debt slavery supplemented by raiding and kidnapping. Slaves were integrated into society differently, but in neither Europe nor Africa at the time was it as brutal as later in the Americas. \n\nAfricans were already associated with slavery in the Mediterranean world, to an extent, due to the Arab slave trade. There were negative cultural assumptions about blackness that already existed. On top of that, there was the growth of international trade from Europe as well as the creation of colonies in the Western Hemisphere. These set up the circumstances for the expansion of racialized slavery, which yes, did also include their resistance to tropical diseases. Many things contributed to this history, not just one thing or another. Both what the person you replied to and what you said get at this history.",

With regards to arabs, I do know that some of the East African kingdoms were allies with Muslims during the religion\u2019s inception. Polytheists exiled Muslims from Mecca because of their practices and some sought refuge in what is now Ethiopia, on the common ground that Jesus and Mary are held in high regard. There were african slaves in Mecca that were freed with the growth of Islam. I\u2019m on your side that Arab culture did view black people as less, but in a time when Islam was more fundamental, its followers put religion over culture for the most part.",

One of the main things were the racial stigmas white people created to justify their owing of slaves. And these stigmas didn't dissipate after the end of slavery no, jim crow laws were created that prevented black people from doing simple things other people could, black people were denied jobs and just decades ago a black person could be lynched in the streets and the people doing the lynching would face no repercussions. Racial stigmas are still believed by the older generation (not all) in america and passed down.  So yes other black people as well as whites owned and sold slaves but that isn't the only factor of racism. Also saying \"well he did it as well\" isn't a good argument in terms of morality",

The results of that exploitation is still present with us today, with much of these populations poverty stricken and are facing suffering on a disgusting level. Yet none of the wealth build by their slave labor and on their stolen land has been given back to them. \n\nAnd before the chuds come at me, this isn\u2019t an attack on white people. I\u2019m just analyzing the material history of human civilization, and if that hurts your feelings, that\u2019s on you champ.",

These dismissals betray our uncertainty. If we're *right* and we *know it,* we don't *avoid* the conversation, we confront it.\n\nI'll be scrolling Reddit looking forward to seeing someone argue their side because someone brought up a point\u2014and instead they get scared and go \"oh well, you're not even worth it..\" it's such an obvious cop-out...\n\nYou're literally going out of your way NOT to confront the issue... \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nTell them! \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\ne* in answer to their question \"so are you just adding to my statement, err..?\" your answer was essentially: *'I donno...'*",

They were both pretty bad, but normalizing castration of your slaves is just a few more steps evil to me.\n\nTo me I know which is worse I my own opinion, that doesn't make this a contest in who has it worse, this are abominable crimes by any judgement.

And it doesn't matter if you want to focus on the Unites States, you still need to consider historic evils in the context of their times and in the context of world history.\n\nAnd remember that the context here is a tweet that if anyone said something similar about black people, would be instantly recognized as a racist comment I believe. People are objecting to quite an extreme comment, that is very arguably racist. \n\nAlso note that \"Whataboutism\" isn't always wrong.

So in conclusion: everyone could be bad no matter if they are black or white and if you are still mad at white people because some of them have ancestors who used to own large quantity of slaves is just people being big babies. Most white people know better and the real problem are the people who are racist not all white people in general. I have no blood on my hands because my country decided to colonize another country that couldn't stand up for itself. I can't do anything about the fact that slavery existed and I'dd say the only thing that went wrong is that a few countries decided to colonize. If you blame white people instead of humanity you are saying that white people are bad. I believe that what many white and black people did in the past is bad and that they have caused the mess called slavery but not modern people as the actions of people should be blames on induviduals rather than countries, for example: modern day germany is not to be held responsible for the holocaust and neither are most of its people, almost everyone who had to do something with it is already dead and the gevernment changed. \n\n\nIn conclusion: I defend white people in this case because skin collour doesn't matter and everyone could be bad or good. Also, the people who downvoted you are also fucking narrow minded as your viewpont is tottaly valid and I can really understand why you think this way.",

Tell me about my right wing bias, after you look at me dragging trump and his cultist sycophants in my comment history hours before he called me that, and since then. :)",

Anything to avoid addressing a single thing I said in any of my comments further up, about him being hilariously off base with his initial assessment. About people like him being so quick to label someone's entire being without even bothering to know their stance on any issues. About how the binary shit flinging is killing rational discourse. Y'all won't touch any of that. Just screech about petty, insignificant shit. I'm starting to think you are his alt, because in several posts now, you've dodged addressing anything I've said about those things just as consistently as he did. \n\nAlso, it is both hilarious and fucking sad, what constitutes an \"essay\" to the Twitter generation, and how y'all think calling someone mad, addressing their post length, or pointing out they commented one more time after saying they wouldn't, is superior to laying out an actual position and supporting it with logic and reason.\n\nTell me he was right to label me a biased righty, his self admitted only \"point\" he made, which wasn't even made because I proved it wrong, or tell me he wasn't. Or, gtfo. I'm not trying to go 20 comments putting thought and effort in with one of you again, while y'all respond with bullshit. It ain't worth my time.",

You came in on your high horse with your little rant about how we were \"two sides of the spectrum\" and blah blah blah. He was obviously the left side. That makes me??? Up? Forward? No. Anyone who reads it obviously knows you were ranting against the partisan left/right dynamic. I proved you wrong by showing you where I'd been calling out the right too. Instead of being a man and owning it, you spent all night losing an argument about it. I thought it was over. Apparently, you seethed about it all night, because even though you got the last word last night, which should have been the conclusion of your little tirade, you came and started it back up again today. \n\nYour \"two sides of the spectrum\" bullshit was wrong. I'm sorry you can't handle it, but it ain't gonna change, no matter how many times you come at me. I suggest you find something to take your mind off me. You'll thank me for that advice once you do. \n\nNow, come get your last word, again. It will be the last this time though, because you'll be blocked. So make it good. Don't waste it bitching about the length of my comment, or calling me a righty, oops, I mean \"one of the two sides, and not the left one, but totally not the right one\", again. :)",

I was talking about one person calling someone a racist, and the other person screaming that \"you think anyone who disagrees with you is a racist!\". You're too blinded by rage to realize it. If you actually read the comment, and QUOTE it, the spectrum I specifically mentioned had nothing to do with politics.\n>\nYou're both predictable and represent two sides of the same asshole-spectrum.\n\nI SPECIFICALLY said \"ASSHOLE-SPECTRUM\", as in, you're both assholes of different varieties. You have a serious issue with reading comprehension. Now I know where you misunderstood me though, so thanks for explaining where you got lost.\n\nBy the way, what is it with you and infantilism? Do you have some parent/son fetish? I'm not kink-shaming, but I do not consent to this role-play and it's getting kinda creepy. BTW, I am a woman. So yeah. Doubly strange.",

By your logic I could take anything you believe and say \"Yeah well the other side disagrees so you probably shouldn't have an opinion at all.\"\n\nWhat did I say that was rage?  Someone asked how that comment isn't racist and I replied in a way that was making fun of people who think that way.  Apparently if I voice any opinion that you disagree with then it's taking rage bait and being a victim.",

White Privelge is also more of a systematic trait rather an individual property, so it's not really about what \"perks\" you get as an individual, but rather you class as a whole based on race.\n\nThe equation doesn't end with race though, so you may certainly have other disadvantages in your life that dwarf any privilege based on race.",

So if a Jewish guy is white, but... like with history and all that... like the Hebrews have literally been the punching bag for all kinds since the beginning of them being specifically Hebrew. So, my question with that in mind, does a Jewish guy have to feel guilty for having white skin or is his ethnic history filled with enough suffering to counterbalance the privilege or whatever? I mean, almost having your entire like bloodline/gene pool eradicated kinda seems like pretty bad. Which would mean that if somebody were to say it wasn\u2019t as bad as something else then it would downplay the holocaust. I wasn\u2019t supposed to use this path of logic, was I?",

I\u2019ll stop there, and that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t wanna have to go into it, Jews-Hebrew, Hebrew-Jews, other ethnicities can practice Judaism, but I don\u2019t think you can call them fully Jewish at that point.

This is Portland, one of the most culturally diverse cities in the northern US. BLM also has massive support here.\nAlso the more you learn about history the more \"white man greatest evil\" notion falls apart as while Europeans were certainly aided by technology to have far greater reach and influence the overall views of superiority, discrimination and pure evil hateful ways is common among all societies throughout history some crimes every bit as devastating and shocking as what Europeans did. Africa had its own powerful empires in the past that were notoriously violent and cruel, middle east is full of examples, Asian dynasties many many times committed atrocities that changed the world forever, long before the colonial Era. Japan in ww2 was a blatant example of this, then there's north Korea. \nMy whole point is evil even in the White mans worst times are actually just par for the course in corrupt imperial, monarchical and dynastic rule.\n\nWe often view the Spartans as heros and the Persians as evil yet comparing the two Persia was a far better society to live in than Sparta which was an autocratic slave state. Persia allowed freedom of religion, relative autonomy in governance, better trade and even some social programs to help those less fortunate. When the jews were cast out Persia proclaimed it would be the refuge to the Jewish people and it is believed Zoroastrianism had in influence on Jewish people and introduced the concept or dualism into the Abrahamic religions, ie the Devil, the antithesis to God and all things good. This is meant to give perspective on who we deem worth remembering and celebrating and for what reasons. Evil knows no color, religion, culture or gender and not all celebrated tales tell the full story.\n\nIf history was better taught and bias less prevalent we'd likely all be better for it and less prone to discrimination as we'd see the similarities more often, both good and bad ones. It could help us isolate certain common problems humanity as a whole suffers from and we can more collectively work to break those cycles and change for the better.",

Those are pretty tight. \n\nAt least that's better than what the English had to deal with, whose imperial success is only matched by the fact that how bland their native cuisine is - save for their breakfast, that is.\n\nIn fact, observe the food and the climate, and you can extrapolate how successful that nation would be at colonizing in the early modern era. The English were dominating. The Low Countries, nothing to scoff at even if they aren't as globe spanning. The Iberians, they had their golden days but were quite marginal in early modern times. And the Italians with their outstanding climate and cuisine - We don't talk about their time in Libya and Ethiopia.\n\nTLDR, don't judge.
