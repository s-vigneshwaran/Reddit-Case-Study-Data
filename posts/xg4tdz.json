They were not. \n\n*Seems* like you would have had to have assumed that they were there because DeSantis called Massachsetts a Sanctuary State (it's not) and you find it interesting that they were \"kicked off\" the island, so you likely believe any of the 6 or so towns on the island are designated as \"Sanctuaries\". They are not.\n\nThey were voluntarily relocated off the island to JB Cape Cod for additional assistance until they are able to go to their intended original destinations. My understanding from the locals and the church that getting in the bus for further help was voluntary. The church has temporary beds that the folks could use. The locals have provided food, clothes, friendship and a cash fund of $200,000+ as of yesterday. That doesn't feel like they're being kicked out or unwelcome, does it? \n\nThere are designated Sanctuaries in Mass, none on the Vineyard, and dropping people off in the state is not the same as delivering them to a designated Sanctuary city.\n\nBut, do go on about how they were \"kicked off\". Plenty of reporting out there shows video of a very welcoming experience from their arrival to their departure. No one was kicked off. I'm guessing most of the 48 do not have the means to stay on the Vineyard. Are you under the impression that Sanctuary locations just provide infinite support and a free house when \"Sanctuary\" is fundamentally a loosely defined compliance level with federal immigration enforcement?",
