And it all sounds very man made.\n\nAgain, I'm not a scholar of the book. And I'm sure there is many good messages and wisdom. It's something I should look into on a deeper level.

                                                  "text": "Sorry its late:\n\nJesus said not to build a monument to Him for a couple of reasons.\n\nOne because we don't know what He looked like and we're then worshipping a bit of stone or metal instead of Christ.\n\nTwo because many of His followers had the confused idea that He had come to conquer the Romans. Building monuments of Himself and making temples to Him while He was on earth would reinforce this idea. \n\nChurches are a thing that are a good and proper thing in the New Testament Church started by Christ. The reasons He said not to when He was around were for the reasons I set out before. Not building monuments to Him is still actually a thing, a lot og Churches realise this and don't have any statues or images of Christ in them, but sadly some don't realise they're actually going against the Lord they say they follow. \n\nAs for the money the megachurches make, yes that is criminal. Christian charities and Churches do need money to function and to extend their reach and do good work in their communities, but when its so clear so much of the money is just going into the people at the top's pockets, that is the furthest thing from what Jesus said to do. He was very clear we should give generously to God and to helping the poor and the sick.\n\nAs for Creation in 6 days, it is about as farfetched as saying everything came from nothing, which breaks the laws of physics anyway. The point is the beginning of the universe was miraculous, however it came to be, and whichever theory you believe it requires a lot of faith and it's impossible to prove either way. \n\nMany of the ideas of the long earth theory of billions of years etc are built on the assumption that creation did not happen, and based on massively inaccurate carbon dating which has been shown to be horrifically unhelpful, (like in this article https://www.siliconrepublic.com/innovation/carbon-dating-accuracy-major-flaw) such as when they carbon dated a rock with a screw in it to several million years old https://www.cultofweird.com/science/ancient-screw-in-rock/ \nIts happened like that several times. People claim that that means ancient civilisations were intelligent, but that completely contradicts the idea of evolution. I'm not an archeologist and so don't know every detail, but I've found several accounts of things like that happening. \n\nAs for Noah and the flood, the evidence for the global flood is pretty astounding when you look into it. https://earthage.org/scientific-evidence-for-a-worldwide-flood/ \nOnce again a lot of this goes back to archeology which once again is not my field but there have been many findings of fish being fossilised while eating another fish, suggesting they were fossilised rapidly under intense pressure, which can be explained by the verses in Genesis talking about the \"fountains of the deep\" being opened up and the pressure being immense.\n\nWe don't know everything about how it all happened but we don't know everything about how much of history happened. It would certainly explain many of the strange formations of ground and rock all around the world, like canyons and such, as well as the clear fact that the continents are shaped that they fit together and are widely accepted to have been connected at one point. I believe the flood seperated them. \n\nI know that's not really proof, but its certainly worth considering. \n\nAs for him summoning all the animals of the world, given that the world was not split into continents, it would not have been as difficult to find all the different species. It is also worth noting that he didn't take every species, but every kind. \n\nThis would have been much easier than gathering every species. Aswell as this, if anyone would be reluctant to accept the idea of God calling the animals, (which, if we are to take the view that God could exist, He is clearly more than capable of doing something like that) then it is worth considering that this was before the shortening of the human lifespan, Noah was around 600 years old when the ark was completed. This means he would have had more than enough time to gather all the animals. \n\nThere is a lot of evidence for much of the Bible. It is a historic book. The miracles (which have been documented clearly outside of the Bible https://carm.org/about-jesus/is-there-historical-evidence-of-jesus-miracles/ https://ryanleasure.com/evidence-for-jesus-miracles-outside-the-bible/ https://www.revelationrevolution.org/surprising-amount-evidence-historical-jesus-performed-miracles/) are only evidence of the existence of an all-capable God. \n\nI understand that it doesn't make sense to you, and it takes time to develop an understanding of it all, we never stop learning. I've certainly still got a lot more to learn. \n\nIk that's long lol sorry, I hope it helps tho :)",
