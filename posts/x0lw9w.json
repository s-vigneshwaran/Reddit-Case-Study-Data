Majority of residents can walk to atleast one local shop, but tbh most can walk to many. We also have easy access supermarkets across the cities too, many are near a motorway or busy road , most buses will route around them too.\n\nFor example, in an approximate quarter of a mile radius from my crappy house , there is 4 sets of shops (some with barbers newsagents, convenience, bakers etc) plus 3 supermarkets . If you expand that perimeter it just keeps climbing.\n\nAnd there are multiple bus routes across the city, that reach every scheme , with a few hubs with multiple buses going passed in different directions to different destinations. My entire city can be reached in 20 mins or less from the city centre on a bus (excluding rush) . There are longer buses too , they are called circulars , they take the scenic route , they hop scheme to scheme, sometimes they are quicker or atleast more convenient for those who prefer no transfers , sometimes two buses are quicker , (aka to town or hub then swap to your scheme). We get day savers too , unlimited travel across the city for less than the price of two trips.",

LOTS of things are expensive.  Things tend to increase in price. Houses are LOTS more expensive, and so are cars.  Are you saying THAT HOUSES and cars are also more expensive to force people to join the military?   Don't be ridiculous.  EVERYTHING is more expensive.  I am not sure why college is so much more expensive. --- But if the government paid for college as an investment in the country's future, it wouldn't matter how much college cost, cuz it would be paid for.  ---- ALSO, In 2020 there were 600,455 U.S. Defense Armed Personnel aged 25 and under.  In the country there are almost 19 MILLION people that are 20-24 years old. (18,964,000 in 2020.) --- which means 18,394,000 people are not 'falling into line' and joining the military because 'here is no health insurance and college is expensive'.  ---- The SOLE reason is the insurance lobbies.  Feel free to google 'how much money do insurance lobbyists contribute to political campaigns each year.  Remember they contribute to the candidates of **BOTH parties**. For what other reason would they do THAT?  And **numerous** Insurance companies contribute hundreds of thousands of dollars **each** to LITERALLY the PEOPLE WHO MAKE THE LAWS.  ---- THIS is what is really wrong with our government.

Potentially allowing 31.1 million people to fend for themselves in doctor's offices and hospitals, leaving them sometimes financially bankrupt and sometimes medically worse off or dead, And then sometimes BOTH.   I find that **infinitely more devious**, malicious and disgusting.  ---- It may be be possible that you are not old enough to have experienced a serious medical event, like a heart attack, or a stroke, at 55 and had NO insurance.  I had both in a 3 month period.  I now have 13 prescriptions I take everyday.  --- Also you may not have experienced a friend who is working a job with insurance but then gets cancer. She gets some treatment (very expensive) paid for by her insurance company, but then she is not well enough to keep her same job.  She has to leave her job and either get a different job working part time (for as long as she can work part time hours) or she has NO job and her family loses the income she had been bringing in, AND no job means NO insurance.  So she changes jobs to one she can work part time, but WAIT A MINUTE, she has previously been diagnosed with cancer.  THAT is a PRE-EXISTING condition.  Her new insurance company says. We will insure you, through your new job company, but we are **not obligated** to pay for anything relating to any **pre-existing** conditions.  When her cancer comes back, (and it did) It won't cover her treatments.  Because she changed jobs and therefore insurance companies.   Between 2005 and 2015 her cancer went into remission and returned three times. She didn't survive the third time, she died in 2015, from cancer.  ---- The point is, I don't know if you have had the experience, that if you have EVER been diagnosed with something (you hurt your back on a bike, or motorcycle, or snow skiing, when you are 24, it is possible that the insurance companies will NEVER be obligated to pay for ANY back problem you EVER have **in your life**, because it is considered a pre-existing condition.  \"Of course you hurt your back again at 29, it was weakened (they say) when you hurt it at 24, and it will always be weak, so we never have to pay for any future thing that has to do with your back.\"  --- The lack of insurance for TENS of millions is BAD.",

And the answer is, presidents don't make the laws, Congress does, and Congress is getting paid by the insurance lobbies to NOT do it.",

YOU don't know shit about what people know or don't know, and since you don't seem to be an American, you **REALLY DON'T know** shit about what people in the U.S. know, or don't know, ***nor*** what they might SAY or NOT SAY.    \n\nSecondly, there is New York City, and there is the state of New York, which is New York State.  New York City is IN the state of New York, which means the name of the city is 'officially' New York, New York, just like the 'official' name for Miami is Miami, Florida, even though everybody knows where the hell Miami is.  There are multiple reason why **'they'** might say New York, New York. 1) cuz it's the actual name. 2) Cuz there is a famous song which is the theme song FOR New York City and the famous song is called (wait for it) \"New York, New York\". And 3) and most importantly, because the PEOPLE who live **in** the State and DON'T live in the city, they don't like it when ANYONE (dumb people like you) assume that when you hear 'New York' it **ONLY** means the City, when there is LOTS of people who live in the state and NOT in the city.  Since the city and the state HAVE the SAME name, you *CAN* say New York, New York to establish you are talking about the city, or you can just say New York City (though New York City is NOT the official name.) FUN fact, people who live in and around New York City (like in New Jersey, Connecticut, New York State), **JUST** call it, **The City**.  Again, another way to simply differentiate if from the state.",

The more people that drive the slower it is. You can't ignore that as a factor in how long it takes to drive. The only reason cars aren't stuck in complete gridlock 24/7 in cities is because the world class public  transit keeps cars off the road. Also instead of becoming slower when more people use transit, more frequent/better service can be provided. This is why public transit is the only scalable solution. Even people who refuse to use transit themselves should be happy to invest in it because it helps keep driving times down as well.",

Research backs this up. \n\nGermany recently made PT ridiculously cheap (9 euro for 3 months or something like that) and most drivers chose to stay in their cars.\n\nInstead of trying to \"scale public transport\" most city planners now try to spread out commerce, leisure and work around the city, which makes a lot more sense.",

Regardless, there are good reasons to invest in public transit that have nothing to do with making life easier for drivers.\n\nI certainly agree with your last point that the best way to reduce congestion is to reduce the number and distance of trips people need to take by making sure services are available wherever people are.",

Yeah, plenty of cities and commutes just aren't set up for proper mass transit options at the moment, which is really the crux of the issue here.

Oh well, we tried. So now let's just spend 3 years adding another freeway lane that will marginally improve traffic for a couple months.\"",

Plus there\u2019s two central hubs connecting all city routes, so a one-way trip that\u2019d take as much as three hours in El Paso takes no more than an hour.\n\n\u2026but that still means you have to plan a minimum one hour travel for a one way trip.  It takes 15 minutes to drive anywhere in Las Cruces by car.  30 in El Paso.\n\nNot saying cars are better than public transport in all cases, but at least in *some* cases you\u2019re better off if you can afford to own a car.",

My 08 duramax was missing washers under one whole side of the bed, making it look like the whole truck was bent... Not under warranty. My younger sister has a base model S that had a paint imperfection, fixed within a week. Tesla has had the best initial quality, or willing to fix it at least, compared to any other vehicle I've bought.   \n  \nEdit: I think the news just hates Tesla, which is easy to see. So anything they can get on the news they will. In my experience, buying over 50 ICE trucks as a landscaper, vs the two Tesla's I've been at the purchase for. Tesla was much better off the lot than any truck iv bought. Sure they had issues, but so does Lamborghini off the lot. I'm sure you can google it and find panel misalignment from any manufacturer. Just louder when it's tesla",

Speeds up to 220mph. 380 miles distance. The trip would take 2 hours 40 minutes.\n\n\n$70 billion on the low end is an incredible cost for a 380 mile distance when compared to maglev trains in other countries going over 300mph and through many miles of tunnels.",

Yes, much of it is not justified and is a reason why infrastructure is so damned expensive in the US today, but  lots of things like emergency exits are also exempted. The capacity is also way lower than subway systems. \n\nThe 2 track MFL in my hometown of Philly can handle 300 pax per train sitting (over 600 inc standing room), and they can get up to 20 trains per hour. That's 12,000 people per hour going through any section on the line in one direction. Some minor tweaks to the system with new cars (introduce automatic train control, longitudinal seating, and enclosed vestibules) would bring that to over 20,000 people per hour.\n\nEven once Tesla can figure out its FSD within the tunnels (crazy that they still don't have that right for such a controlled environment), they are still at 4 people per car. To get to 20,000 people/hour going through a portion of the tunnel would mean 3 cars every 2 seconds, a practically impossible feat. Even if they could achieve that in the tunnels (Hint: they would massively struggle just to get one car every 2 seconds), the \"parking lot\" system of boarding that they need would mean their biggest stations for people to get in and out of the cars would need to be absolutely massive.",

Western Europe seems to have figured this out with regards to making practically every major city have extensive public transit, including intercity travel. \n\nThere isn\u2019t the customer base because the infrastructure has failed people - car companies lobbied to build extensive highway systems and make unwalkable neighborhoods that rely on cars to get literally anywhere. Therefore they\u2019ve grown up only knowing cars and not seeing another option. In many major cities there would absolutely be demand for transit - not everyone can afford a car or should necessarily need one, especially in dense urban areas. \n\nI\u2019m not even suggesting connecting rural areas that are super remote out. There will of course be use for cars especially in rural areas. But there are far too many dense urban cities in this country with absolutely no public transit where it is completely viable - but is a policy/political issue. \n\n> Also public transport in the US is full of disgusting, obnoxious people.\n\nThis basically translates to you hating poor people. And you think 2.5 million people riding the subway in NYC are disgusting and obnoxious? And like the roadways aren\u2019t filled with people who are similarly obnoxious?

Here there\u2019s already pretty decent transit between cities (Northeast Regional, Acela, commuter rail) and most of the larger cities have metro systems (Boston, NYC, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and DC) while many of the medium sized cities have some light rail or are served in part by the transit system connected to a neighboring city. That\u2019s true for Alexandria in Northern Virginia. The medium cities and more built up areas around those cities need better transit and can probably support it. I\u2019m looking at Worcester, Providence, Hartford, etc\u2026 and BRT and LRT or even a light metro in some instances. The only other places that are probably as dense off the top of my head is the Chicago area and some places on the west coast. \n\nMost of the US isn\u2019t nearly this dense though. Even a lot of \u201clarge\u201d cities only have a large population because they cover so much land area. They\u2019re basically glorified suburbs. San Antonio is slightly smaller than Philadelphia population wise but is almost four times larger by land area. There are 4,607 people per square kilometer in Philadelphia compared to 1,110 in San Antonio. You\u2019re just not going to be able to build a rail system that serves a large portion of the population in an area that isn\u2019t that dense. At least not one that will be cost-effective while reaching a large portion of the population. The less dense an area, the fewer people that can be served by each line without an additional connection. The density issue just keeps getting worse. Tucson, Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, Salt Lake City, all have a density of less than 1,000 people per square kilometer.",

              "text": "What exactly is the \"pain\" part supposed to be? I've commuted via public transit for years and while bad weather does suck a bit, you simply dress for the weather and get going. A well-implemented transit system will have a shelter/covered area at each stop so that you can get out of the weather, and you may get a little wet along the way, but provided you look out the window/at the forecast and prepare for the weather, then it's really not a huge deal. But meanwhile, I've got to commute via car for my current job and the parking lot is a 5-minute walk from the building entrance. If it's raining when I leave for work, I'll likely grab a jacket, but in the summer, it absolutely sucks to sit in a car in the heat wearing a rain jacket. Meanwhile, trying to get in/out of the car with an umbrella is a whole other pain in the butt. And God forbid it rains unexpectedly while I'm at work or in the car and don't immediately have a jacket or umbrella on my person. I've gotten soaked by the rain when I've been out in my personal vehicle more often than with public transit just because of the dynamics of it all.  \n  \nBut the weather aside, seriously, what is the \"pain\" part? Getting a blister because the average person doesn't walk more than 20 minutes consecutively around a Walmart more than once per week? Imagine what would happen if people exercised more. Tripping over a loose stone on your commute? I've seen people fall *up* the stairs in their own home for literally no reason. Missing the bus/train because you're late? If you're late to the bus/train and are late to work because of it, you're going to have the same issue if you're in the car. Difference is that if you leave on time, you're far less likely to see a train delayed more than 5 minutes than you are to be stuck in traffic for an extra 15-30 minutes because two tired idiots don't know how to move their cars out of an intersection when their bumpers kiss.  \n  \nAnd people with mobility issues? This doesn't exactly related to the average person, but q relatively small percentage of the world population is disabled. But even then, every disability is vastly different and has its own set of limitations. Yet in the last 10 years, I've rarely seen a well-constructed public transit system that doesn't take disabilities into account. Buses and trains have deployable ramps for wheelchairs, wheelchair-friendly zones, and the stops/stations have elevators/chair lifts for the disabled. And the best part is that these have usually had infrastructure for the blind as well - beveled pavement lines to guide blind pedestrians, hand rails, etc. You're not going to see a blind person driving themselves to work every day. At the end of the day, the only thing that's preventing people with disabilities from enjoying public transit is the people that deny comprehensive public transit systems from being created.",

And mine was certainly very different then yours.\n\nI live in one of the biggest cities in the world but it's in a 3rd world country. And my experience is still better than average around here.\n\nRiding the bus home meant waiting standing up for over one hour split over two different bus stops and also standing up one and a half hour more inside a crowded bus with people rubbing their smelly bodies on you (and you rubbing yours on them, even if you didn't want to). You'd be wasting those times twice a day. By car I'd be home in half the time. Inside the bus you'd probably be pressed against some metal bar because of how full it is. At some bus stops you would be waiting 5 minutes for the bus to leave because there's way more people trying to get in than the bus can actually fit. At your stop you'd have to make your way through a 2 feet wide corridor with people on both sides so you can get off. Once I got to work I'd have sweat stains all over my clothes.\n\nBy car, like you said, you could be stuck in traffic for an extra 15-30 minutes if anything unexpected happened. But riding the bus, if there was an accident, your bus broke down, there was a driver's strike, the trains broke down overcrowding the bus lines, you could be delayed 1-2 hours.\n\nOh, but when it rains... With the increased traffic you could double you commute time if you drive a car, but in a public transport you'd never know how late you would be. Like you said, a well implemented system will have shelters at the stops, for me it was true for the stops on my way home, but not for the ones in my way to work. Even with umbrellas, if you stick 30 people together in a bus stop you are gonna get wet, even if it's just from the water dripping and bouncing from other people's umbrellas. Even the sheltered one were not big enough to fit everyone waiting. You'd see people waiting for the bus away from the stop so that they could take cover in nearby buildings. Once inside the bus you wouldn't be safe from the rain either. Many poorly kept ones would have leaking from the roof or windows that can't close properly. If the rain started suddenly there would be a good chance that all the seats would be wet with puddles on them before they got a chance to close the windows.\n\n\nI'm not saying that using individual vehicles isn't worst for society as a whole than public transport, but there definitely is a \"pain\" trade off involved. Sure you can say my experience is irrelevant because of where I live, but I don't think someone in a poorer American community would have such a difference experience.",

Especially in most places in the US, that is not the case at the moment. Yet the only thing stopping us from having infrastructure like that is the fact that it's not being planned and built at this time. I mean I have 3 major highway road work projects happening locally due to traffic congestion yet none of the public transit projects implemented on the other side of the city are planned to expand to my side of the city. It just feels like a missed opportunity, as it just delays the implementation of better public transit in my area in the long run.",

If we invested a similar level of resources to create proper infrastructure and connect places that people actually want to go to instead of putting bus routes only along busy multilane roads without anything nearby any given bus stop we could have a public transportation system that made cars simply unnecessary for the vast majority of people.

And plenty of people still ride mass transit in cities like London, New York, Chicago, etc. Hell in most of those cities riding the trains is almost seen as a badge of being a true \u201ctough\u201d local rather than the weak outsiders. \n\nResolving the bad human behavior *is* something to be addressed. Improved mental health care and a degree of visible security would go a long way toward making transit cleaner. But it\u2019s honestly not necessary to get people onto transit. If you make it affordable, reliable, frequent, and convenient, folks will ride. And all of those are addressable by making investment into them.",

I said that Elon never claimed to owe all of his success to himself... How is that strawman?? This person is making an argument against something that no one is saying.\n\nI scrounged online with different searches trying to find evidence of the claim that Elon is just writing checks for his companies with little to no input, and found nothing. Everything says that he is the lead in product design and engineering. Tesla existed for less than a year before Elon was the lead share holder...and has been CEO since 2008.

It doesn\u2019t have the variety or reliability that a car has. You have to walk to your destination from further away if it\u2019s not directly on the bus route, and your ride leaves you once you step off, so you\u2019ve got to wait yet again until a bus with the correct route stops by. Add the time it takes for the bus to stop for other passengers as well. A 10 mile trip across town would be faster in a car than a bus, period. Same goes for most distances unless it\u2019s the big city example I started with, whereas a train would be better than either a bus or car.",

I was just pointing out that many places have a problem with door-to-door time due to frequent stops and long headways. you're not even defining your question, because there are many factors that go into the performance of a transportation system, and you haven't defined how you weight any of them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I don't see how digging a tunnel for cars is ever going to be better than some paint and buses\n\nthe majority of tram lines, US light rail lines, and even some metros have ridership low enough that it could be handled by buses. do you think all of the transit planners for cities around the world that have trams or light rail lines don't know that buses exist?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Paint and buses are cheap\n\nbollards and paint for bike lanes are even cheaper than buses. a typical city bus system in the US costs $2 per passenger-mile, and gets worse as you get below-average density. that's more than the cost of giving people free bike/scooter/3-wheel e-scooter rentals and running paratransit for the \\~1% of people who cannot use one of those three.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I'm still waiting on those examples of people denying the last mile problem though. But it doesn't seem like you're ever going to share\n\nI listed three things that reduce door-to-door time and none of them were last-mile. did you reply to the wrong person, or are you replying to me? [here is a link to an example](https://www.reddit.com/r/confidentlyincorrect/comments/x0lw9w/comment/imcsfou/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). ironically, by talking about bus prices and last mile, you are your own example of someone ignoring wait time, boarding time, and stop spacing. the first/last mile is one issue, but all fixed-route systems have that issue (though, not bikes). however, different modes have different headways, stop spacings, and boarding times, so those are more useful when talking about fixed-route services.\n\nsubsidized bike/scooter purchases and rentals are cheaper than operating ANY mode of transit, and bike lines cost less to construct than any rail line, and are on par with BRT. the advent of the e-bike and 3-wheeled e-scooter have obviated the majority of transit, but people refuse to update their ideas about how the world should work. last I checked, bike lanes were on the order of 1/10,000th the cost of intra-city rail, meaning an entire city can be covered with separated bile lanes, and even many of them covered, for less than the cost to construct a single intra-city rail line.",

For context I live in Europe so I can't speak for others but here are a couple of factors that change things: traffic and parking.\n\nIn well designed cities, buses rarely get caught in traffic (and in some places even get priority at traffic lights for even more convenience) due to dedicated bus lanes. \nSecondly, finding parking for your car at destinations in cities isn't always easy especially at a reasonable price. You can easily find yourself parking a distance from your destination and having to walk.\n\nNot saying that public transport is always faster and more convenient than cars, but if the system is properly designed it can get pretty darned close/faster in most urban situations. Personally as long as I don't need to have a car to comfortably get around at a reasonable speed and price, I'm happy. More options are usually a good thing.",

The only \"solution\" they ever come up with for easing traffic is to add more lanes but that's been proven to do nothing because the lanes have to reduce at one point which jams the traffic up again.

It doesn't come with buying a $45k asset you can later only sell for $15k.\n\nAn apples to apples comparison will amortize those costs into the monthly cost of driving a car, rather than writing them off as a one time aberration.   For example, a $1200 repair in December would raise your average monthly cost of driving that year by $100.

They just use it a lot less. Because for *some* trips they ride a bicycle. For some trips they take the bus. And for some trips they drive.    \n\nIf a Dutch person needs to go to the ER at 2am then they're not taking the bus. But if a Dutch person needs to be in the city at 9am then they're far less likely to drive than an American. Because they don't **have** to drive to get literally anywhere.",

Dedicated bus lanes and  signal priority (i.e. something that overrides the normal red/green order so busses don't waste time at red lights) can be big.  As is increasing the frequency of service and designing the system to minimize average transfer times. \n\nIn a suburban context, though, it's often more about general urban design.  Optimizing urban design for cars often pessimizes it for everything else.  For example: maze-like housing developments discourage through drivers trying to avoid traffic, so they're a good design feature if you assume everyone has a car.  They also make it take significantly longer to walk or bike from a house to a destination outside that development.  Giant-ass parking lots that are at best half-full on black Friday are mildly annoying in a car, but significantly more annoying if you're on foot from the bus stop. \n\nSuburbs with decent public transit are possible to build (just look at traditional streetcar suburbs), but it's much easier if it's an initial design goal rather than trying to retrofit it in.",

There's a neighborhood in my city that used to be its own township before it was annexed in 1930.  At the time of its annexation it had a population of less than 4000 people, yet it had its own street car system until the mid-1940s.

This whole exchange is just silly. Cars have their place, focus on getting them into shape with EV and better lithium harvesting methods, let's get far more public transit out there especially EV public transit, and work on getting codes and zoning fixed to change how roads are built to reduce reliance on cars and car interactions with pedestrians, bikes, and public transit. I'm fairly confident pretty much everyone reading this thread would agree with this, no?\n\n Villainizing a transit method and anyone who uses it doesn't fix the problems with it; nor does rejecting any positive change in the transit method for fear that it might stick around longer; and is something I see really often with fuckcars people and it's ridiculously childish and has turned many off from the movement.",

A few years ago I didn\u2019t have a car for a few weeks after I sold the one I had and was waiting for the new one. Taking the bus was at times uncomfortable, crowded, and it did take a little more time to go from place to place. However, I FUCKING LOVED IT. Not having to stress behind the wheel, being able to grab my kindle and read for a while, basically not having to actively pay attention to something was glorious. Would I give up my car now for public transport? Nope. Because again, it\u2019s insufficient. But it gave me a taste of what could be with adequate infrastructure. I fantasize of a time when I can go 95% of places with an electric scooter and public transport. Fuck cars.",

I rather pay for the ICE than stand in a sardine can for free with someones backpack in my face. \n\nAlso from my own experience with public transport from the last 3 months: the longer time to get i.e to work becomes a secondary factor once it offsets the cost by orders of magnitude. So the past 3 months the deal was \"full route by public\" and in return because the ticket was just 9\u20ac the saved gas expenses could be used on dining out at work wich was great cause no time spent on grocery shopping or cleaning dishes or utensils. Resulting in a net time win. So that's basically what you gotta calculate agianst one another. Personally i would draw the line at 45min per ride though sinply cause that's the duration of most podcasts i like to listen to on my way. \n\nWouldn't move closer to the city or inside it though cause its just too crowded and loud for my taste. But if they would continue a really cheap ticket it would be a real deal for me probably resulting in reducing my car rides per week from 3-5 to 1 for groceries and laundry.

So the past 3 months the deal was \"full route by public\" and in return because the ticket was just 9\u20ac the saved gas expenses could be used on dining out at work wich was great cause no time spent on grocery shopping or cleaning dishes or utensils. Resulting in a net time win. So that's basically what you gotta calculate agianst one another. Personally i would draw the line at 45min per ride though sinply cause that's the duration of most podcasts i like to listen to on my way. \n\nWouldn't move closer to the city or inside it though cause its just too crowded and loud for my taste. But if they would continue a really cheap ticket it would be a real deal for me probably resulting in reducing my car rides per week from 3-5 to 1 for groceries and laundry. Depending on how many days i plan to visit the office.",

And this is coming from someone who used to have to travel all over London all day for work.\n\nI can't speak to Manchester or Nottingham, having not been there, but that's part of the issue - they're all independent systems.  A nationalised public transport system would allow consistency, and point-to-point travel easily and at minimal cost.  Imagine, you tap onto a bus that quickly and easily takes you to the train station, then with the same card tap onto a train that takes you across the country to a totally different city where you get a tram to your final destination, all with a system like the Oyster card.  But no, instead we have disparate companies providing terrible service at the highest price they can get away with, not the lowest price possible.\n\nIt's almost like capitalism is the problem.",

It's basically three total routes that meet at a central point like a bird's foot, but one of the toes is significantly less-used than the other two, so it's just a V with a branch in the middle.\n\nI'm not saying public transport *can't* be better than cars, I'm saying that it *isn't*.  A significant portion of the time it takes me is waiting around, but even then one leg of the trip (because I have to take two buses minimum) is twice as long as it takes to drive.  Then there's the fact that the bus I have to take is once every twenty minutes, and sometimes just doesn't bother to show up.  So I have to leave work at specific times, not being able to leave at my leisure.  Even when I do, I often find myself sitting at the stop deciding whether I should wait the twenty minutes to the next one when one doesn't arrive or to walk the fifteen minutes to the main road to save a little time at the cost of energy and annoyance.\n\nPublic transport, in basically every place I've ever been, is inconvenient, expensive, and unreliable.

In my car I don\u2019t wait, and go straight to the destination. A 30 minute bus ride = 5 in the car\u2026 so he\u2019s right, the image is misleading because the buses take up 3x as much time, which equals space if you think about it. If everyone rode the bus there would be either be an hour gap taken out of everyone\u2019s day, or there would need to be multiple buses so they don\u2019t waste as much time, which negates the purpose because the bus is meant to save space, not take up more\u2026 \n\nmaybe we need trains, because trains are fast, on time, and since they are technically infrastructure, places build around them more. A good train ties a community together with its infrastructure. A good bus just relys on the infrastructure already there. A bus is a leech, nobody looks at bus routes when planning on what to do or where to live, or where to open a business. The world doesn\u2019t exist around buses like it does with trains, because their routes are not permanent. Trains are faster and reliable enough communities exist around them, so you can RELy on your train route not being stupid as hell going seemingly random places. Buses suck ass",

I'm using public transport for around 20 years now. that and biking. But I live in a city where I can catch a tube every 5 to 10 minutes. If I want to visit my friends in a village. It gets horrendous to get around. there is no reason for companies to build a good network in villages, because they can't make money from the 10 people that would use the service.

Yes there is no controlling who gets onto the bus, however the absence of cars does make other things more tolerable such as less pollution and less noise pollution. Picture, if you will, the inverse of this situation, you would say something like \u201cI could take my car to work, but why would I want to? Increasing traffic, pumping out smog and producing ear damaging noise\u201d The human brain doesn\u2019t make these observations so you can be forgiven for not considering them. \n\nHowever what I find unforgivable is your second paragraph. Car infrastructure is miles more expensive to maintain than bus or rail and tax money is not the end all be all indicator of a functioning society. The point of tax is to improve the quality of life of the citizens, car infrastructure cripples quality of life, making the air less breathable, the streets hotter and causes hearing damage and literal insanity. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure so all the tax money does is poorly solve the symptoms. \nIf you were to quantify all the advantages and disadvantages of car infrastructure you would absolutely find more disadvantages compared to plentiful public transit. \nAlso this isn\u2019t even considering insurance costs, parking allocation, maintenance costs, a place to store it at home. \nIt\u2019s extremely late and I\u2019m on my phone, lmk if you want sources and I can get back to you later",

However, [if some locations choose to administer fines to particularly noisy vehicles](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/71662), that doesn't seem like a bad policy to adopt, and seems like something more attainable to argue in support of.\n\nFor your comments on car infrastructure being more expensive to maintain, I'm afraid I don't understand how you believe it costs so much more public transport would if it was scaled up to meet demand, but I'd be interested to see that if you've got a breakdown",

I would much rather pay $40 to sit in a luxurious train with free wifi and food for 4 hours then take 3 times the cost in fuel and time to drive the same distance where you don\u2019t get to relax or sleep and have to be aware of everything so you don\u2019t crash and die. It\u2019s also superior to paying $400 for a 1 hour flight as your time in the airports will make it longer the the train, it costs more then the train, and is less comfortable then the train.",

The vast majority of non-office jobs are pretty spread out and don't really create transit issues in the first place. There are some job locations where people are needed on site and there are a lot of workers at a location such as factories, universities, or hospitals. \n\nThose locations should fit into the existing infrastructure or provide their own transit solutions. Having society bend over backwards to serve the interests of extremely profitable/wealthy institutions seems like putting the cart before the donkey. If one needed to drive a big excavator to their work the societal solution is not to make roads that can fit and accommodate large excavators.",

Should I also mention the last years of a pandemic that spread like wildfire through densely packed populations?\n\n\nHow should I transport anything sizeable? I do work on my home. Should I somehow try and carry a 4x8 foot sheet of plywood in the bus or train? No I won't. Should I pay out the ass to have it delivered? Also no. \n\n\nThe point is that investing in public transport is good. It gives options to people that don't need or want a car.

Where's your civil engineering qualifications? Tesla? Where are your engineering qualifications? Neuralink? Where is your neurology degree?\n\nThe way he releases information onto places like twitter really doesn't highlight the fact that HE IS JUST THE MAN WITH THE MONEY. Anything more he does is basically attend meetings with people who are gonna dumb down stuff for this dude, make descisions involving money and pay, and then do media. \n\nAnd before you ask: designing spacecraft needs aerospace engineering qualifications, not a general physics one. He has loose ideas, and other people do the actual hard work to make them a reality. Edison all over again.",

Only way to have public transport as a desirable option is to cut it's use off to the public lol. Did y'all forget that we have a homeless problem and drug problem? Maybe go ride the Atlanta metro lol. \n\n\nAnd yes, most people would lose time by walking to a bus station. Takes me 15 minutes to get to work, by car. What scenario outside of shitty high density zoning laws would walking to a bus be faster than driving directly to a business? \n\n\nSurprises me how stupid people are on Reddit sometimes. Full access to almost an infinite amount of crack head on public transport videos and still support it. Infinite videos of people complaining about apartment neighbors but yet still support high density plans. \n\nSorry guys, I'll be on my acre and commute 15 minutes.
