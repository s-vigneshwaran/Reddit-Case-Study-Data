  "text": "TIFU by not telling my husband about a lottery I won years ago\nThrowaway account because some of my friends/family know my real one\n\nThe lottery winning took place back in August 2014. Mike and I were married in October 2014. It wasn't a fortune, but enough to make a difference. After taxes it came out to right around $480,000. Most people would be over the moon, but I panicked. I didn't want our life to turn upside down because we had extra money now.\n\nI was still legally single at the time, and so I was able to accept it anonymously without the need to tell anyone else. So I didn't. Tell anyone else. Not a single soul. Not my husband, my parents, siblings, best friends, etc. Only the state and federal governments.\n\n(My husband has a tendency to spend on things we don't need and that aren't going to benefit us in the long run so I didn't want our money to blown quickly on stupid stuff like cars and clothes.)\n\nI opened a new bank account with a national credit union and put the check in. Got started with a financial advisor (Keith), who guided me into investing in local businesses and real estate. And that's that. It's been sitting there since, just growing.\n\nFlash forward to today. I'm doing dishes getting ready to start making dinner, and my phone rings. I can't get to it but figure I'll call them back. Then I get a text. No big deal. I'll get to it in a minute....but husband came into the kitchen and glanced at my phone to let me know who text me and called me (which he always does if my hands are full).\n\nIt's Keith. He called and text me to let me know my account just hit $1 million after one of the energy companies I invested in soared recently.\n\nMy husband is stunned. Has no clue what to even say, staring at me until he says \"we have a million dollars??\" I was so flushed but finally just sat him down and explained the situation. He's clearly mad at me for never telling him. Asks if my family knows, and I tell him that no one knows except the IRS and Keith.\n\nIt took him a few hours to finally be able to really talk to me.. at the end of the silence he told me he's proud of me for investing into our future but he needs a few days to clear his head because he feels like I hid a huge part of \"myself\" from him.\n\nWe might just need to take a vacation now.\n\nTL;DR I won a lottery in 2014 and never told my husband until he learned that I grew the money to a million today.\n\nEdit: I already have people messaging me asking if they can have money. Jesus. This is why I didn't tell anyone!!\n\nUpdate! My husband and I just spoke on the phone for about an hour. He told me he's staying with his best friend/coworker tonight but that he's not angry. He agreed he would have spent the money on dumb things if he'd won it and is happy that I put it away. Little less happy that I didn't tell him about it for so long, but he said he doesn't care and doesn't want this getting in the way of our marriage.\n\nUpdate!!!: Hello! Jesus I didn't know this would blow up so much. I've been at work and talking to my husband Mike all day, basically laying down some ground rules for the money moving forward. He will not tell anyone (didn't tell his friend!) and we will only dip in for emergencies and pre-discussed things. A few people asked in the comments how much we make a year, I guess to see where we'd be without this money. I currently make around 60k and Mike makes more at around 85k. So to all the ones saying I \"starved him\" or \"made him scrounge\" that is not true lol. We make a good amount.\n\nI have no clue how to post all of the screenshots of the clowns in my inbox, but I'll try to put something in the comments!!",

Everything she could do to mess it up, she did.\n\nI actually cleaned up a bunch of small stuff for her without her knowledge just to start clearing the deck on things.  We keep almost 100% separate accounts on everything except for a joint account for shuffling money between us and one joint card to use when necessary.\n\nHer biggest fault is putting her head in the sand on anything financially related.  Part of this is her parent's fault, and they readily admit coddling her in this area for her entire life (she was 35 when we met).\n\nAs a result of this, I handle the finances in the household.  I do the taxes.  We have set up automatic weekly transfers from her account to the shared one to cover her car, insurance, etc which has to be in my name.  Her credit has been so bad, when I went to lease a car for her (my score was over 800) they wouldn't let her be on the lease period.  That's how bad it is.\n\nShe's massively overdrafted her account several times, once with me not finding out until it cost me several thousand (not only clearing the account status but covering all other needs in the meantime) dollars.  She got a $500 Visa card which she promptly defaulted on when she was unemployed for 2 months.  She has a $300 Kohls card that has already been shut off and turned back on 4 times in a year because she hasn't paid it on time.\n\nIf we were to come into a large sum of money, even though we are married I would likely not tell her about it.  I would continue to provide a comfortable life for us, allowing for new luxuries the money would afford.  I have never denied her anything within even the slightest bit of reason, and never will.  She likes cruises and other trips, we'll go.  She likes certain things in cars, she'll have it.  She likes racing, so we're going to 2 NASCAR races plus a 3rd lower series one this year.  What she's not getting is a blank check because she has the financial skills of a middle school 90210 trust fund baby.\n\nWhat happens if something were to happen to me?  I would arrange a financial advisor to either portion it out, or put it all in an annuity to provide a lifetime income for her.  This is the same reason I don't plan on taking SS until 70 as she will be 67 and will get the maximum lifetime benefit out of it.  Thankfully I love my work and can easily see myself working even past this point.\n\nThere are probably a lot of people that will find fault with this arrangement, but it is what is needed in our case to maintain financial sanity.",

I finally broke free, quit smoking, moved out with roommates first then got my own place, lost 192lbs, hit the gym, got a basic wardrobe, got out around people, took up country line dancing (which is where I met my wife) and made a shitload of new friends in the process, all of which only ever saw the \"new\" me.

Since switching to (dirty) keto, these have all but disappeared.  The only time her stomach hurts now is when she eats common processed crap.  Other than that, she's happy as a clam.\n\nShe has also dropped a ton of weight.  A her highest, she was up around a size 14 or more.  Now?  She was over the moon this past weekend because she easily fit into a pair of size 4 jeans.\n\nThis is one of those areas where you have to pick what hills you're willing to die on.  Even though it is more expensive (and we DID have a talk about how much she spent that week and she has been a lot better since), sometimes you just have to bite the bullet.\n\nAnother example of this is her love of Melaleuca products.  For the uninformed, Mela is an MLM, but you don't hear as much about it because they are forbidden from doing standard MLM Hunspam all over social media.  They sell a lot of cleaning and health products.  The products are good, but certainly costs more than what it would be in stores.\n\nAlthough I'm not a fan of her buying them (and she is NOT selling any, all personal use), with how much her and her mother like and use many items I'm not going to go to war over spending an extra $20-$25/mo on things.  If I tried, I would only be buying $100 of grief for every dollar I tried talking about.  Example of just leaving it as 'happy wife, happy life'.",

She's an adult.\n\nI didn't realize this until watching my younger brother move through life, but if I had a different personality, I could have also been financially coddled. My older sister and I naturally just cared about... managing our own lives and learning about the world (including how to be responsible about our own finances).\n\nMy brother on the hand does not care. He is 30 now and is still completely coddled by our father. I don't think he even has his own credit card.\n\nYou don't just wake up 35 years old one day and realize \"oh my god, I never learned about financial health!\" I'm absolutely certain that in the 35 years before she met you, she's stood face-to-face with financial consequences, realities, and limitations. And that she made conscious choices each time -- many involving certain sacrifices. Even if her parents stepped in and got her out of each mess.\n\nI guess I say this because people put way too much blame on parents who \"spoil\" their kids, and the creation of financially reckless adults as a result.\n\nI grew up surrounded by ultra-rich people, working class people, and everything in between.\n\nI know people who grew up absolutely loaded and spoiled, like Ritchie Rich style, and the second they were adults became financially independent even if it meant majorly trading down their lifestyle. In fact, I know a LOT of people like this.\n\nI also know a lot of people who grew up working class, with parents who preached the value of money, and who turned out as spoiled, financially co-dependent and irresponsible adults.\n\nI'm an independent person so I know I'm biased and it sounds like I think less of the latter group, but philosophically speaking, I don't. I don't think they are necessarily \"lesser than\" people. I just do think it's an inherent personality thing.\n\nSure, parents can enable it or try to discourage it, but there's only so much they can do.",

                      "text": "Yeah, but the thing is, there are consequences to being codependent on your parents.\n \nYou can\u2019t be both completely autonomous while also not taking actions that are heavily guilt-inducing. That takes a certain personality type. \n\nYou have to not feel bad about potentially crashing the car that someone else paid for. You need to not care at all about being able to judge how much expendable income you truly have, because you don\u2019t have any. So, what is a splurge? \n\nMany people like to (or even need to) feel that they\u2019ve \u201cearned\u201d something they treat themselves to. It\u2019s how a typical human brain is wired. It\u2019s why a beer at the end of a long workday feels so good. Or a delicious meal after a workout.\n\nI\u2019m extremely lucky in that my parents fully supported me through college. I didn\u2019t have to work. They paid my rent, tuition, car, groceries, etc. I always felt extremely uncomfortable not being able to judge what I could \u201cafford\u201d or not. I remember stressing out because I would get a $10 salad/hot food bar meal from a local market twice a week, and I didn\u2019t know if that was extravagant or not. I didn\u2019t know whether it was frivolous if I spent $100 on a new outfit once or twice a year. If some friends were taking a trip, I didn\u2019t know if I should go or not. The only way to judge what was reasonable or not was to ask my parents, which is uncomfortably subjective and just made me feel not tied to the real world.\n\nThe second I graduated and could work, even though I was making minimum wage, I finally felt like I had money! Because after basic necessities were paid, I\u2019d realize \u201ccool I have $100 leftover this month! I can afford to go out to dinner a couple times.\u201d Or buy a new pair of shoes, etc.\n\nMy parents never made me feel bad about anything, and I had a really good, positive relationship with them. They never used my financial dependence to try to control my life or any of that, so it\u2019s not just that. Although that is a HUGE personality thing \u2014 how many someone is willing or not to be put in a situation of having someone else make decisions for them.\n\nThis is like life and death to me. I am severely uncomfortable with being in a position where I can\u2019t make my own decisions and financially back them myself, where someone has a say in my life because they pay for it. And I have no \u201cnurture\u201d reason to be this way. Nobody has ever tried to actually control me with money. It\u2019s how I am.\n\nBut I know a lot of people who simply don\u2019t mind. They feel at ease being in a situation where someone else has a say in their life choices and situation. They don\u2019t feel particularly rewarded (at least not enough) by having to personally \u201cearn\u201d something.\n\nAgain, I\u2019m not saying those people are morally inept or anything. Feeling like you have to \u201cearn\u201d everything to enjoy it, or not feeling comfortable depending on others isn\u2019t necessarily a positive personality trait to have, it can lead to its own behavioral and emotional issues. \n\nI do just think there is a lot of natural brain wiring at play. Your wife is definitely in the latter group. And based on how extreme her spending habits seem in terms of judgment and accountability, I would say no parenting can create that. It can merely enable it. \n\nTo me, I\u2019m somewhat impressed about your wife\u2019s lack of anxiety. Anxiety is something I have to be medicated for (lol), so it\u2019s not all bad to live life so carelessly. I\u2019m sure it makes her a great person to have around in several aspects of life.",

For example, one federal Credit Union I use, I am both paying down a debt (couple hundred a month, automatic payments) and another $300-$350/mo for when it comes time for me to replace my car (paid off since last summer, has a couple of good years left in it).  This is an automatic withdrawal from my checking account to this one.\n\nI am a big fan of automating as much as possible.  The money that moves around, I never \"see\" it in a way that I can make impulse purchases on.  When the time comes, the money will be there.\n\nWhen it comes to household budgeting, another area my wife used to give me grief on is my coupon use.  Now I'm nowhere even close to what you see on coupon-clipper reality shows, but when I showed my wife how I was able to stack discounts and get her a 2 month supply of Xyzal for under $11, she stopping busting my chops :)",

The first year we were married, she insisted I do the same.  I humored her that one time, if only to make sure that my studying on what I had to do different did not miss anything.

When my wife and I were first married I was finally able to get my student loans to disappear (won my case against the Art Institute school system) and was down to a small credit card that I asked to never have a limit increase. When I met my wife and we agreed to get married we were in dire financial straights. I was going through neurosurgery and insurance was doing the best it could to deviate the costs until the time to check out was and only update me and not my wife. When we got married and started to merge most of the accounts I had come to find out that the majority of her cards were either severely delinquent and or had been left to rot in collections. My struggling to peak 740 score shot to a 480 once her name was connected to mine. We ended up getting the consolidation loan opened up and then I\u2019ve been paying everything off all at once to push me back up to 600. There\u2019s moments when I will talk finances with her and mention that I have closed X account or paid that account and I don\u2019t understand where the mindset of paying below minimum on medical debt or debt you don\u2019t think you should have came from but since being married we\u2019ve had 4 instances where she\u2019s ignored major medical debt until the collection company locates me and asks to have the balance paid off. Finance is definitely not her strong suit but I still explain that we are working together and she can contribute to closing the account so long as she allows me to take the responsibility off her plate. It\u2019s not healthy but it makes the stress shift off her and then we can talk dollars and cents together without her thinking about why it\u2019s being spent and knowing it means we will be able to have extra savings/spending money and widen our budget for that hopeful big ticket house purchase down the road.",

                  "text": "> was down to a small credit card that I asked to never have a limit increase.\n\nI did the opposite, for a couple of reasons.\n\nFirst, there is the utilization percentage.  The more open and unused credit (other than a pair of socks every year to keep things active), the less any expenditure would affect your score.\n\nAvailable credit is NOT debt.  The fact that people treat it as such just because the number is there is one of the problems with how they understand finances.\n\nWhat's the best way to get increases?   Put a chunk on it and pay it off several months later.  Doesn't matter if you pay it with actual money or \"pay\" by transferring a balance to another card (which will end with a reporting overlap where both show nothing on it) as you're paying it down.\n\nThe second reason?  In a true SHTF scenario, I want every dollar available to me possible.  We're not talking \"car breaks down\", we're talking \"house just blew away in a hurricane, both cars died at the same time, we got matching cancer diagnosis and it's use the credit lines or be homeless and/or dead.\"  *IF* it ever came to that point, I'm not even caring if I can pay it back.  It is a backstop to use for pure survival, even if it means filing for bankruptcy afterward.  Hope it never comes to that.",

Where did you learn all this? I didn't teach you it!\" And the thing is, nobody really did. It's just little tips I've collected, me overanalyzing my budget, an anxiety issue that gets triggered by financial security concerns, a tiny sprinkling of common sense, and a lot of luck that I figured it out.

I learned from my mistakes though and have had a pristine credit file for many many years.\n\nOther financial stuff, I learned from talk radio of all places.  I was that weird kid that would stay up late at night listening to [Bruce Williams](https://radioink.com/2019/02/11/hall-of-famer-bruce-williams-dies/), learned so much just from his show.\n\nThankfully I did NOT take the lessons being taught by my parents, especially my father.  To them, the dollar was king above all else, including family.  They thought it was ok to ignore the kids then trying to make it up at Christmas with literal floor-to-ceiling presents.  When I was ~10-11 (much of childhood is a blur to me, you'll understand the possible reason why momentarily) I figured it all out.  I stood up on the couch, puffed out my chest and exclaimed, \"Take it all back.  **YOU CAN'T BUY MY LOVE!**\"\n\nGot the shit beaten out of me for that one.  One of countless times.\n\nI don't even like getting presents anymore.  I don't celebrate my birthday either because of a similar incident.  It took a few years for wife and in-laws to understand that I value time and attention FAR above gifts.\n\nI'll freely spend on them, though.  I like doing it because I want to, not out of any sense of obligation.",

My ex also did some dumb things which affected me for a long time, but nothing like a bankruptcy or fraud. We had a conversation about our future together and she told me she will never get married again because the legal contract of marriage can fuck both people up even if only one person is being crazy with money. And I think I agree and I\u2019m good with making some other kind of formal commitment to each other without involving the government.

They are however the contract states. It's also where you make it clear what happens to your assets if you or spouse dies, or who gets retirement funds, etc etc. It's a lawyer thing. My in laws did it. They both came from other marriages and already had their retirement stuff. When he dies, his family will get his stuff and when she dies her family will get her stuff, no 50/50 split or one spouse's family getting everything (no fighting). A spouse can get a hospital visit easier than a \"friend.\" There might be a few other situations where being officially \"family\" may make it easier too. I think some car insurances give a discount as well.\n\nJust something to look into if you change your mind. :)",

I don\u2019t think marriage serves a purpose other than determining legal rights to property and rights/obligations to children. If it\u2019s purely symbolic, then why even get the marriage license? If you look at the origin and history of marriage, it was a way to make sure your property stayed in your family. It was also a way to control the women and to provide men with assurance that their offspring were theirs. If none of that applies due to a prenup, why bother? I can have a ceremony and declare my love and dedication to my partner, have a lawyer help us with any property issues, make sure my partner has control over medical decisions if that\u2019s what I want\u2014 I can do any of that another way without marriage.",

The diet coke of marriage.\n\nAnd some people might just want to be husband and wife and have some legal benefits while not sharing assets.

I also read about a study that found that women (in heterosexual marriages) tended to be less happy after marriage and the main reason they found was because the things they did for their partner before marriage became expectations after the wedding. While they were happy to do those things because they wanted to, something about being *expected* to do them affected their satisfaction with the relationship. If you think on how marriage shifts the dynamics of the relationship, there\u2019s a good argument for not doing it if you\u2019re not super traditional. Of course I understand that those shifts don\u2019t happen to 100% of couples, but in general, in our society, that\u2019s how it has worked for decades. Something to discuss in depth with your partner before you tie the knot. My now-ex-husband expected me to do all kinds of wifey shit that I just wasn\u2019t cut out for. I tried to do it because that\u2019s how I was raised, but it was miserable. I sucked at filling that role, he sucked at filling the traditional husband role, and as a result he resented me and I resented him. If we\u2019d thought about this and really explored whether that was who we were as people and how we could\u2019ve adjusted our expectations, we could\u2019ve avoided a lot of strife.",

After college, she was the one making payments. Then mom and dad hit financial troubles and mom stopped making payments, and was too embarrassed to say anything.\n\nA letter shows up to my friend and her husband's home basically saying a payment was missed. Not only that, but where my friend had gotten some scholarships, he hadn't. He took out loans for the full amount, so the balance was pretty high. They got married and she had no idea. She found out right when she finished paying her loans off.\n\nHer husband was essentially useless, and so my friend had to call up her new MIL to find out what happened and get the passwords for the payment portal, which the MIL did not want to hand over. She finally gets it, and then has to come up with a payment plan so they can get everything paid off.\n\nSomehow, they're still married.",

In the USA when you can no longer pay your credit card debt it goes to collections, basically the credit card companies sell that debt off to a collection agency so the contract with you becomes void and there is a new owner. We would take control of talking to the card holders before the debt went to collectors and we would negotiate it down to sometimes as low as 12% of the actual debt. We'd work out a budget with the client and a payment plan they could actually afford and we would get a percent of what the negotiated amount ended up being. This was a benefit to the card companies because they usually sold the debt off to collection agencies for pennies on the dollar. One trick is to NEVER agree to pay an aggressive collection agent who has no legal hold over you until you start paying and then you become wholly liable for the full amount because you created a verbal contract with the collector.",

After my divorce years ago I filed bankruptcy and promised myself that I would never be in that situation again. It took a little time but my credit score was 800+ with just a little discipline. \n\nWe talked about how WE were going to tackle the debt but she continued to rack it up faster than I could help her pay it off. Even after I sold a house, I paid off some of her smaller accounts to make some progress in hope of motivating her but that didn't work.\n\nThankfully the relationship didn't work out and I regret the amount of money I spent trying to help her. Unfortunately I am a cosigner on a motorcycle loan for her. When she kicked me out she said that she would refinance it in her name. It's been over a year but it's still in my name as well. Thankfully she has stayed current with the payments.\n\nNever again will I put myself in that situation or tolerate a partner with a poor financial history.",

Over the years it grew into the hundreds of thousands, plus helping pay for the new house (3/4 paid for) and nice cars. And I still have hundreds of thousands for retirement.  \n\nThat minor amount every payday will add up and compound over the years, so you have more options for retirement. I like to say that if you can live on your take-home pay, you can live on 90% of your take-home pay.  \n\n(Canada offers an extra incentive - RRSP contributions, sort of like your 401K or IRA, can be deducted from taxable income - creating a larger tax refund that can also be put into the savings.  Pull the money out in old age when your tax bracket is lower.)",

We each put a certain percentage of our income into that account (I had a monthly auto-transfer, since I'm salaried; she does freelance work, so the amount she put in varied from month to month) and basically knew nothing about each others' personal bank accounts or investments.  It wasn't even anything we needed to discuss for tax reasons, since we live in a country (Sweden) where there aren't tax incentives to file jointly, plus she has the tax complications of being self-employed, so we filed separately.\n\nI realize that might sound a little crazy if you're used to having a single joint account for everything, but that's not really done here.  What she grew up with was her parents having completely separate accounts and then they both saved all their receipts and, at the end of the month, added up how much each of them had spent, debated which things were \"shared\" expenses and which were \"personal\", and then calculated which one of them owed the other money based on how much they spent on shared things - and I get the impression that's the norm here, at least for the older generation.  (Although we're in Sweden, I grew up in the US in a single-parent household, so I didn't come into the relationship with strong expectations for how to manage shared finances - but I absolutely knew that I didn't want to do it her parents' way!  Far too much work for too little benefit, IMO.)",

Idk if it worked out well when they bought the hotel and when they bought the theater tickets...\n\nBut at dinner he wants to get a pasta dish for himself, she wants to get a wagu beef something something.\n\nHe doesn't like that and tells her age can them use her own money to pay for her dinner. \n\nThis is ONE example. Every single date, vacation, basically anything that is joint is argued about. Hell they can't even decide which things are joint sometimes either. \n\nFor example these were my husband's friends that we went out with. All 6 of us connected through the men. so My husband's at there was a whole argument about if *he* should pay for the whole weekend because *he's* the one that's going out with his friends, even though it was a date night, which is generally joint.\n\nMy husband and I have combined money for 23 years, even before we were married.

The differences can definitely takes some getting used to once expenses become shared!\n\nI'm unhealthily obsessive with my finances, mostly because I've always had to be.  My income and expenses have been close to net zero for most of my adult life.  Whereas my boyfriend's financial situation has basically always been pretty comfortable, so he hasn't had to monitor his money very closely.  \n\nHe has a vague idea of how much should be in his accounts based on how many hours he's worked and his normal spending habits, but I have a spreadsheet that shows me what all my balances should be every single day for an entire year.  It has my paychecks on the days they'll hit my accounts and all of my known and estimated expenses for the year.  Then at the beginning of each month I clear the estimated spending portion for that month and enter my spending in real time.  If I want to see if I can afford something, I can enter it in then look ahead at my balances for the following few months to see if I'll dip uncomfortably low at any point as a result.  I recognize it's all a bit crazy, but it works for me.\n\nWe bought a house together last year and we opened an account for house expenses.  Into my spreadsheet it went!  We each contribute to that account then mortgage, utilities, etc. come out of it.  I still obsess over my individual finances and I monitor the house account to make sure there's always enough for the bills.  I have a certain amount each paycheck direct deposit into the house account, and each month he just asks me how much he should put in.  \n\nFor the first few months it was really hard for me because I felt completely blind without knowing how his individual accounts were looking.  I didn't want to ask him to deposit very much into the house account since I had no idea how much money he had, and I've always had a hard time asking for money help anyway.  I was wearing my personal accounts thin because of it.  Eventually we had to just sit down and go over everything together.  It essentially boiled down to him showing me his balances and paycheck, and saying \"there's no reason either of us should be struggling with how much I work.  We're a team, and you can always ask me for however much you need.  It's not that I'm helping you financially, these expenses are both of ours together.  If I ever think my accounts will get low at any point, I'll let you know, but until that happens just assume I have plenty.\"  (He makes over 2.5x what I make and his spending/expenses are pretty similar to mine.)  I'm still not 100% comfortable with it just because of how I am, but I'm getting there, and I know now that I don't have to bear all the stress about money alone since whenever any worry might come up we'll discuss it together at that point.",

I am anal-retentive about paying bills on time and making sure we have retirement and rainy day funds. I set us up with a credit card that gets paid off monthly, no revolving credit.

Our credit is spectacular, we have no late payments, banks beg us to take loans.

All of us have strengths and weaknesses ranging from superficial to significant to destructive. Whether it's substance abuse, or simply a lack of responsibility with a particular subject like finances; it's ok to still love each other and even keep allow people in your life, as long as their behavior isn't interfering with your life beyond what you're willing to accept. (We all have those friends who are always late or known for flaking at the last minute. \"Ok, nbd, that's just Johnny\".) Their behavior isnt a \"problem\" unless it's a problem for you. The actual problem would be if we *didn't* treat each other accordingly. If I leave my kids with someone who is well known to be irresponsible, whatever happens is on me. If I loan money to someone who's a well known gambler, its foolish of me to think I'll ever get it back.\n\nIt seems like to me that you and your husband both accepted each others strengths/weaknesses prior to getting married and continued to operate in them through marriage. (You handling the finances this whole time.) This on its surface is smart and many couples operate this way. Communication gets a little grayer, but is ultimately specific to each couple. IMO, If you never lied, and he simply never asked, nbd. If he periodically wanted to spend money and you replied with \"we cant afford it\" rather than having an honest discussion about why you don't want to spend money on X particular thing, than I can understand his mixed emotions and that's a grayer area that you'll each need to work to clear up. If he ever asked to be more involved in the finances or asked about them and you blatantly lied, then (again IMO) that's a bigger issue. That's an issue of trust and open communication with your life partner and needs to be strengthened for the health and survivability of the relationship. \n\nNo matter which way it actually went throughout the last 8 years, congratulations on discovering the next thing that will ultimately strengthen your relationship once overcome. Whenever you both decide to come back to each other to discuss, it may be a good idea to take him in to meet with Keith. With areas of sensitivity/insecurity, it can be easier to \"learn\" from a third party than from your spouse. (Same reason therapy helps.) \n\nAnyway, I'd counsel you both to remember that the relationship is more important than any amount of money or unintentional hurt caused. Remembering this is more important than the millie in the bank, but congratulations on that too!\ud83d\ude1c. Good luck/god bless.",

As long as the dividends aren't huge (market-wide dividend yield is pretty low these days since many stocks don't pay them) and you have other investment accounts, they basically just show up aggregated onto a single line on your 1040 with a random accompanying 1099 from a  generic financial institution (from which you probably receive other 1099s if you use them for your other investments).  \n\nI just looked at one of my 1099s and it tells you nothing about the total value of the account.  You could roughly infer it using average market dividends, but the form itself only shows dividends and taxable transactions.\n\nI doubt her husband actually knows what their combined AGI should be without the lottery winnings.  Even if he knows both of their total salaries, things like pre-tax deductions, investments, various credits, etc. can change the bottom line number.

I\u2019ve worked hard, but also had a very successful career. Now, at 43, I have what most people would consider \u2018a lot\u2019 of money. \n\nMy family (parents, siblings) don\u2019t really talk about money much, but they also feel like they can tap me anytime they need something. They\u2019ve \u201csold\u201d me houses, cars, whatever when they need cash. Sometimes they\u2019ll just outright ask for money. Always with the promise to repay it, but they rarely do. Generally, I\u2019m happy to be able to help. Occasionally, it rubs me wrong (when we go on vacation, I always pay everyone\u2019s lodging. They usually want to split the cost of groceries. Cool, but\u2026one of those things is not like the other), but not often. \n\nMy cousins try the same approach. I hate to lie to them, but I have to always have a story ready about why I can\u2019t help. It\u2019s incessant. \n\nThen people who aren\u2019t related, but knew me from before we were doing well. I\u2019m constantly getting invited to things- concerts, sports, what have you. Always with the assumption that I\u2019ll pick up the tickets & expenses. Turning it down is exhausting. \n\nAnd then the barrage of people I\u2019ve never even met, who are having a hard time of things. I donate around 10% of my income to causes I care about. That\u2019s a level I\u2019m comfortable with. I\u2019m sorry that things aren\u2019t good for you, but I can\u2019t solve everything. \n\nMoney makes everything weird.",

His friend laughed, said, wtf, and convinced him that it didn't matter and he'd cover all the costs.  A few grand a couple of times a year meant nothing if he got to hang out with his friends more.  Took my parents a while to get OK with it.  But now they are and try to pay it back in some small measure with helping on various things like remodels, moving vehicles around the country, etc.",

My parents and siblings have never asked for a dime. Extended family? Wants a handout. Birth family (that I was adopted away from)? Won't talk to me unless they want me to give them something. \n\nI was able to go in with my siblings and pay off all my parents debts. No mortgage, no car payment, nothing. Just monthly bills. They went from being super poor to living a pretty comfortable life and I am so happy I was a part of that. I give about the same as you (sometimes more, sometimes less) to charities I care about, especially the local food bank. \n\nI stopped with the stories for the extended family though. I can't help because I don't want to help you. You've been ungrateful and never paid me back. You don't even pretend to want a relationship with me other than as an ATM. \n\nThe worst part is when things went sideways for me there was no one in the extended family to help me. My siblings did but they have families of their own and I'm not going to take anything other than just enough to barely survive. I paid back every dime and am forever grateful. I would take their entire families in if things went sideways for them. My parents did, and I paid back every dime of that too, and they're always welcome to come stay as long as they like. I have a cold and calloused heart to those that I helped before that wouldn't (not couldn't!) Even spare me $5 to pick up a rotisserie chicken so I could eat for a couple of days.",

Tge feeling that a $50 purchase wasnt a \"big deal\" was kind of thrilling. I think in some ways it was a way to be frivolous with money without it being spent on myself and causing feelings of guilt or anxiety (thanks, childhood).\n\nThen I realized I dont actually have as much disposable income as i thought and being an adult is fucking expensive. Lol. But for a little while, your feel wealthy in a way that you havent before and it feels nice to share.",

Mum is right into genealogy and family history at the moment so spends a lot of time on the computer. I have bought her a few bits and pieces like a large monitor, probably will buy a new laptop soon as hers are always cheap rubbish.\n\nIt sometimes feels weird to just be able to say oh yeah, I won't really notice that gone and it will improve your life much more.",

The average financial advisor will, in my experience, advise you to invest in medium to low risk funds, which perform more like what \"Keith\" did. Whereas what ZoraTHut is advising is much more volatile. In the long run, volatile funds will outperform safe ones, and the volatility shouldn't worry you if these are funds you do not plan on touching for a long time.\n\nCommon knowledge is that the baseline return should be around 7% per year. My Nasdaq fund has returned over 20% per year for the last 10 years. The trade off is that if the market implodes, you can lose 40% in a year.\n\nI guess to answer your question, go to any financial institution, ask about a financial advisor, and ensure they are a fiduciary. This means legally they have to give advice for your best interests.",

                      "text": "Honestly, if you've got 4 figures, anyone *professional* is going to eat all that with fees. There are some Beginner Guides To Investing online, but here, let me just write up some quick advice.\n\nA lot of people describe investing as a choice between high-return high-risk options (mostly \"stocks\") and low-return low-risk options (things like \"bonds\", \"certificates of deposit\", etc). This isn't *wrong*, but even the \"high-risk options\" tend to be risky on a period of a few years, not on a period of \"until retirement\". And exponential growth is a terrifying force; on the scale of a decade or two, the \"high-risk\" options will pay out *far* more than the low-risk ones.\n\nJust as an example here, imagine two people who, by titanically bad luck, invested right before the worst single-day market crash in history. Sam got stocks and was hit by the full force of the crash, Blake got bonds and was entirely immune to it. Sam lost 22% of their money instantly . . . and three years later, they were worth more than Blake anyway.\n\nThis is why I personally recommend just dumping everything into stocks; if you choose your stocks not-terribly, it'll more than pay off compared to the alternatives.\n\nSo how do you choose your stocks not-terribly? Well, here's a quick flowchart.\n\n* Do you have specific detailed knowledge of an industry that you're willing to stake a lot of money on? If so, you don't need my advice.\n* Otherwise, invest in index funds.\n\nA lot of people will give suggestions on what index funds to invest in. It kinda matters . . . but only if you can predict the future (and if you can predict the future, why are you reading this, you already know which stocks you should buy.) Honestly, it doesn't matter *as much* as just getting started.\n\n*How do I buy this stuff?*, you ask. There's a bunch of sites online that work. I use Etrade, because I used to use another service and they got bought by someone who eventually got bought by Etrade. They're all pretty much fine. (Except Robinhood which kinda fucked over its users. Avoid Robinhood.) Feel free to look for reviews then just pick the one with the most stars, it doesn't matter.\n\nSo the tl;dr here is:\n\n* Find a site you like. If you're unsure, I tentatively vouch for Etrade.\n* Put your money in. If you're *sure* you won't need it, put it in a retirement account, it saves you from future (or present) taxes. (Whether you choose IRA or Roth IRA depends on your income, if you're curious I can give a quick rundown on this.) Otherwise just put it in a normal account because then you can pull it back out easily if you need it for an emergency.\n* Find an index fund you like. If you're unsure, I tentatively vouch for QQQQ. Shove all your money in there.\n* If you change your mind later, it's not a big deal, all of this can be moved around.\n* If you can afford it, set up monthly deposits.\n* If the stock drops, don't worry about it. If the stock rises, don't throw a party. Just keep on keepin' on.\n* All of the above can be improved if you learn more, but, seriously, just get started, it is not a catastrophe.\n\nAlso, remember that now you have an extra form when filing taxes.",

But this isn't a situation where all else is equal, and the point I'm making is that, if you're investing on timescales longer than a year or two, the benefit grossly outweighs the risk.\n\nYes, there are cases where you wouldn't want that risk.

That's a terrible argument because the solution is not to do that. Index funds are convenient because you won't lose everything unless we end up in a Mad-Max-esque apocalypse, and if that happens, it's not like bonds are going to be worth anything either.\n\n> That likely outperformed the indexes on its own.\n\nNo, she gave the dates and I checked.

She continued to work and contributed the bulk of her retirement savings during those years. When they divorced, he got half of most of her retirement and she got none of his, because he made all his retirement contributions prior to the marriage (California).\n\nOP won her money and invested it prior to the marriage, so she's similar to the retired firefighter. Just like if you own a house outright (no mortgage) before you marry, your spouse doesn't get half of that. But they do get half(ish - it's a little complicated) of a house you buy or make  payments on during a marriage. At least in community property states.",

Its part of their private finances. You can\u2019t argue \u201cwell the debt also becomes the spouses\u201d without also arguing \u201cwell now the $500k also becomes the spouses\u201d. You can\u2019t just claim its different when its beneficial to you. Thats literally moving the goalposts. \n\nAlso yes, when you get married you literally assume their debt and subsequently their wealth. \u201cFor rich or for poor\u201d, right? Technically you aren\u2019t *obligated* to disclose that information but you\u2019re a douche if you don\u2019t.\n\nAlso if you\u2019re going to quote me, fucking quote me instead of mixing my words around:\n\n> you typically agree to be open with someone, especially in regards to finances, when you get married. \n\nKeywords: \u201ctypically\u201d and \u201copen with someone\u201d I specified finances because thats what we\u2019re talking about and its objectively a pretty big part of a relationship whether you want to admit it or not. \n\nAlso if you can\u2019t be open and trust someone why the fuck are you getting married anyways?",

Investors usually make more than business owners if they're good at it. \n\nNow, Trump is a bad investor. During his presidency, he pumped 13 trillion dollars into the market and recovered 7 trillion dollars. And he only managed to recover some BECAUSE he manipulated stock prices. Since he was president, it wasn't illegal. When this was brought up in Senate, it was dismissed because there's no law saying the president cannot manipulate the stock market.\n\nThen again, if he listened to the investors who offered the plan, the state would have earned about 43 trillion dollars by now. That would've made him a great president. But no, the oompah loompah sold, manipulated prices, and took a loss causing even the investors of that plan to ditch him.\n\nHe is a decent businessman though. Just don't let him personally dabble in the stock market.\n\nSources were Congress TV (where they speak of bills and state funds), stock news, CIA's annual reports from 2017-2021, and reported debt-to-GDP of 2017-2021.",

You'd have to have a significant drop in prices from their highs back down to older pricing levels for that to occur. \n\nAs long as you see the year over year stabilize and slowly crawl downward, then you should expect inflation rates to normalize in a real sense. \n\nWe're also coming off of a year where the annual inflation rate fell to zero.

If you plan on living off of the median income you need about a million invested. If you want to quit your job at 25 and be able to live off of investments for another 60 ish years you're gonna need more.\n\nAlso keep in mind that the median income is below a livable wage in a lot of areas, so depending on where you live you might need a lot more than that just to be able to afford to exist. The U.S. is massive and the cost of living varies so wildly that things like \"the cost of living in the U.S.\" or even looking at median incomes is practically worthless. Even looking at it on a state level, keeping in mind there are 50 states in the U.S., isn't super useful. The average cost of a house in my county is 3x more than the average just a few counties over.\n\nSome places are cheap enough that a 30 something could retire off half a million, and some places are so expensive that a half a million would only pay your expenses for a few years.",

The thing about luxury is it's a spectrum, it doesn't have to mean yachts and fancy cars. Video games are a luxury, TV is a luxury, they're just luxuries we take for granted because they're generally affordable for most people in Western nations.\n\nAnd the thing is if you have a large windfall you can stop caring about bills and money and afford more luxuries. You just can't afford the level of luxury that requires that you're regularly earning millions. A multi million lottery win that's properly managed will make you comfortable and mean you can afford a nice house (not a mansion), a nice car (not a top end sports car), and go on nice (not lavish) holidays once a year without any worries about money.\n\nBut a lot of winners spend beyond even their rather extended means, invest in bad business ventures, or get swindled out of their winnings. To be honest not accepting the winnings anonymously is usually the first mistake they make.",

Not even considering how long it would take an average person to realistically save that money? Completely out of touch.\n\n>1/3 of US households make about 1/4 of that every year\n\nSo in four years they make that amount? But they have outgoings, let's say it takes 8 years to actually save that amount. Imagine how much they would have made in investments in those 8 years if they'd *just been given that money*. According to op, about another 500k, double the money.\n\nIt's absolutely a fortune. Many people won't even be able to save that much money in their entire life. All OP had to do was hire a financial advisor to manage that fortune and they became a millionaire with virtually zero effort on their part. In less than a decade.\n\nIt's enough money to set you up for life as long as you aren't downright stupid with it.\n\nIt's a fortune by any accounts except those that have a larger fortune.",

There are entire businesses that have sprung up to just take advantages of the inevitable financial crisis that a lottery recipient can find themselves in.\n\nOP absolutely did the right thing, even if their partner is pissed.

Instead, it's enough to feel relatively safe that you'll have a decent roof over your head when you're old.\n\n\nIf you're in your mid twenties, seriously start saving now. Do the math. If you're gonna live into your late 80s, how much money do you need to survive if you stop working at 67?",

It\u2019s too little to quit your job and retire, and most banks won\u2019t give you a private banking relationship at that level, so you\u2019re mostly on your own or \u201clow touch\u201d management. It\u2019s easy to spend too much here or there, get used to that lifestyle, and piss it all away faster than you think and actually end up behind. \n\nThey say you can put something in an index fund then withdraw 2% indefinitely while still letting the principle slowly grow, which for 500K means you get about a 20K bonus a year. That\u2019s awesome and will help protect against unforeseen setbacks and have a really nice Christmas, but not live like you\u2019re \u201crich\u201d. \n\nOnce you get over $5M, that 2% gets you into a six figure income without doing anything, sustainable indefinitely. And you can get better investment advice for how to avoid downturns and protect and grow the wealth. At that point the wealth can start to become your job if you want. But that\u2019s a long way from $1M. \n\nSo kudos to OP for handling this really well. Hopefully it continues to be part of your long term plan. This wasn\u2019t a FU at all.",

If you take out 4% of $1.5M every year, that's $60,000. As long as the stock market is returning an average of 4%, you're keeping your stockpile and living off interest. You're in great shape.",

Historically, only 5% of the time has the 4% rule not allowed you to 'go infinite' or live off of your interest indefinitely. Those years were when this hypothetical investor had such unfortunate timing that they invested at a high point in the late 20s and were withdrawing in the 1930s at the beginning of their 50 year retirement, dipping into principal early on.

Something like 10% of all households in the U.S. make more than $200k/year, so I highly doubt 5% of people spend $130k/year in the ways that you are (ignoring that considering 5% of people \"fairly normal\" is a totally bizarre use of that phrase to begin with).",

Spending $1000/mo on personal training when you're in that kind of debt is silly, regardless of interest rates. Your income isn't guaranteed, a huge financial catastrophe isn't impossible, and if the time comes where you really need that money, not being in debt will be far more important than having gone to a personal trainer.\n\nI don't care what you spend your money on, and this is obviously going no where.

You're paying more than twice as much, meaning either your house was more than twice as expensive as the median home, or you could allow yourself the luxury of committing to paying it off much faster, or a combination of the two.\n\nPaying for the nursing home or housing or your grandparent also isn't common (although obviously not irresponsible).\n\nStudent loans typically have interest rates of 4.5-5% and a 10 year term, so if you pay 1500 USD a month you probably owe somewhere north of 100 thousand USD. This is more than three times the U.S. average of **new** graduates.\n\nHaving a personal trainer that costs upwards of 1000 USD a month is also definitely not common.\n\nSo if you had a more normal mortgage (~2000 USD), didn't pay for your grandparent's housing, had a normal to high-ish student debt (~500 USD a month), and didn't have the personal trainer, your monthly expenses would be 5500 USD lower.",

At typical costs, you're looking at $500-1,000/mo left over after necessary, non-emergency expenses. If you don't use all of your healthcare budget, cool that's extra money. But you can't count your chickens before they hatch, so you need to put aside $8K of your healthcare expenses every year for medical expenses and the rest ($5-7K) is just for premiums alone. It's really not enough money to make most people feel comfortable. In fact, over a decade ago, a study said you needed to earn about $75K/yr to feel comfortable while a more recent follow-up study from Purdue came up with the number of $95K/yr. And that's for single people. This is based on actual expenses people reported by the way. It's not just asking them for a number and going with that.\n\nI get that for a lot of people this is a massive amount of income (half of American households earn less than it after all). But because of welfare cliffs, life at $60K/yr isn't really much better than at $40K/yr. And with $1.5M in assets, life is potentially even worse at $60K/yr from capital gains as your only income than it would be if you were just earning $60K/yr in ordinary income and didn't have the sizeable after-tax assets as it will disqualify you from most of the aid that you might still qualify for otherwise.",

At $60K/yr in the USA, you first need to budget your health care ($15K/yr) and your taxes ($2,748.75/yr assuming **only** long-term capital gains and no state income taxes this gets a lot worse if you have any other income or live in states with income taxes). So you really only get $42,251.25/yr that you can actually spend. That's $3,520.94/mo for living expenses. Sure, that's a good chunk of money. You're not going to be homeless (in most of the country, still can't afford the SF Bay Area), but you're not going to be comfortable. You're somewhat protected against emergencies because you can simply take money from your big pool of cash but at the same time, a 4% withdrawal rate is already dangerously high outside of periods of extremely high growth (such as the last 10 years) and taking more will reduce future income significantly. And on that income, if you want to have a family, you either need to get a job or have a spouse with a job to help pay for expenses as you're going to be spending at least $2K/mo just on living expenses (property taxes, maintenance, groceries for **1 person**, homeowner's insurance, etc.), another $500/mo on transportation (I assume you can't afford to live somewhere with good buses or trains on this income), and well, there just won't be a lot left over for a kid after you include groceries and everything else. So it's a great safety net and is a life-changing amount if used properly. But it's hardly going to make you comfortable without another source of income.",

Toss in a cost of ownership for a car (because we're assuming you can even live on this amount which rules out almost anywhere with competent public transportation) which is about $10K/yr for a new vehicle and $6K/yr for a paid off vehicle. So now we're looking $35-39K/yr in remaining funds. Take out $2.5K/yr for property taxes (US average for all homes), so you're looking at $32.5-36.5K/yr. Take out food costs of $5K (US average for 2020), so you're at $27.5-$31.5K/yr. Now take out your homeowner's insurance of $1.4K (2020 average), so you're down to $26.1K-$30.1K/yr. Now take out utilities (average in the USA is around $2.1K/yr), so you have $24K-$28K/yr left... and oh, I forgot to take taxes out at the start. I'm going to be generous and assume this is all long-term capital gains. Well, phew, that's only $498.60 for 2022 if you're single or $0 if you're married (but all of this assumes you're single). So let's call that $500, so you have $23.5K-27.5K. And I'm going to assume you live in a no income tax state because those are the cheapest places to live.\n\nAnd now let's talk health insurance! So that's going to be $5.5K/yr right off the top. Then if you use it, the average deductible is about $4.4K before you start getting insurance to cover anything. So let's just budget $9.9K/yr for health insurance as that's your likely liability if you have any health issues what so ever. But keep in mind that your max out of pocket including premiums is another $4/yr higher. So up to almost $14K/yr for healthcare. But we'll use the middle number. So that's $13.6K-17.6K/yr after the likely costs of health care all based on average US costs.\n\nNow, let's hope you don't have a kid because well, you're already struggling on this amount of money and pretty broke without another source of income. Welcome to the reality of the vast majority of Americans. Except they have to pay rent on top of this. But then, you're paying for home maintenance and repairs because you own the place. One fix per year can easily cost you a few thousand in parts and labor. But you're not working, you're presumably healthy, so maybe you can eliminate most of the labor costs for minor things, so you only pay for parts 50% of the time. So maybe one year you're spending $1-3K on a new home appliance and nothing else. The next year you might have a plumbing issue that you can't solve for a thousand. Or maybe you need roof repairs due to a storm. Or maybe your home is just aging and needs new windows or insulation. All of that adds up.\n\nAt the end of the day, from a $1.5m lump sum, you're really not doing that well. Even if you already owned your home outright going in as in your assumptions, you're still not doing very well overall. You have some financial freedom but for the most part, you can't afford to raise a family, your vacations are going to be pretty barebones, and you're not going to really be able to afford as many luxuries as you think you are in your assumptions.\n\nOh, and I never got to the giant whale in the room: the 4% withdrawal rate. At that rate, you'll run out of cash due to market crashes which occur generally every decade or so. A safer long-term withdrawal rate is more like 3% or 2% which is low enough that you should never run out of money. 4% is typically used for people who are already at retirement age and looking to burn down their resources to almost nothing by age 100-105 as that's older than they can reasonably expect to live to.",

I couldnt buy my parents a house or even a new car without significantly dwindingly funds. Its enough that my wife and I could grow it to early retirement, but not really enough to support her father who probably only has 5 years of life left in him and will work until 5 minutes before his funeral. \n\nIts a good problem to have, but it would be as stressful, if not more stressful, than winning say $50k, because at least that is easy.

I can't show you this, it's top secret.  But anyway, tell me what you're looking for in a financial advisor?\"   Then he interrupted my uncle about half way through his speech and apologized and said he had to attend to something very important for a minute, and he walked out of the office.  So my uncle got up, went around the desk, and looked at the guy's computer screen, and he was managing TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS!  And also the CHARTS AND GRAPHS WENT UP UP UP!!!!   He grinned at his craftiness, and when the advisor came back, my uncle said \"I want you to handle my entire portfolio.\"  \u0ca0_\u0ca0\n\nMy eyes could not have rolled any harder when he told me.  I'm sure he's getting fleeced, I just hope he doesn't lose out on his retirement money.  But he's so proud of himself and so excited about his financial guy.",

Yes they could have earned so much more, but there is a chance it wasn\u2019t all Keith\u2019s fault. You have to also realize that a lot of advisors may not have the level of authority you may think. Depending on the company, they may have an algorithm of what to invest their clients in depending on their specific situations. I am a financial advisor btw.. not just speaking out of my ass\n\nEDIT: Not to mention, local business and real estate may not also be what she\u2019s invested in. If I could express what my clients say about their portfolio and investments I can tell you they have no idea what the hell they are in no matter how many times I explain it to them. They only pick up certain things from the whole conversation. So for example, in OP\u2019s case, the advisor could have been talking about an REIT, which is a real estate investment trust. Definitely two different things from raw real estate to an REIT. If you\u2019re not financially literate with stocks then you may have a hard time explaining it like OP. Again, the things you\u2019d hear from clients talking about their investments is crazy lol",

That is horribly not diverse. \n\nIf they took the money in August of 2014 and put it into the S&P500 they should have about $1,276,800 now. Vanguard runs a ETF that tracks both and charges 0.03% a year. For 99.5% of people this is what I recommend. Places that will beat the SP500 will often have catches. Like the hedge fund I work for is closed to new investors and has significant restrictions on people's money. There's mandatory time commitments for the money with large fees to pull it out.\n\nAlso, side note. Their advisors are moron for texting financial information.

Seriously, this is the only advice that 99% of the people need regarding investments. It covers the entire world for diversity, and offers bonds to keep your risk manageable. Now, once that account crosses $5-10 million, looking for planners to help protect via trusts may be a good idea, but if your balance is less than $5M, just stick to the above portfolio.",

A quick check of the historical returns of the S&P 500 from 10/2014 to today you should have over 1.2 million.\n\nI'm not a financial advisor and this isn't financial advice, but I'm saying you may want to do some research. You may have paid a guy 200k to do something that you could have done in 5 minutes.\n\nSome books to read are: The Simple Path to Wealth by Jim Collins and Money Master the Game by Tony Robbins. Also check out the FIRE community who has a lot of investing resources. r/FIRE r/financialindependence  plus numerous podcasts on personal finance and investing.\n\nAlso, you may want to consider maxing out your retirement accounts each year, including roth ira if you're not already doing so, even if you have to use the money in your investment account. The tax savings alone could net you hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars depending on your age.\n\nPLEASE don't sit back and do nothing because you are intimidated by investing and are \"happy\" with the returns you've gotten so far. Do your own research and make sure your money is invested how YOU want. It's literally the most important thing you could be doing with your time.",

Yes they could have earned so much more, but there is a chance it wasn\u2019t all Keith\u2019s fault. You have to also realize that a lot of advisors may not have the level of authority you may think. Depending on the company, they may have an algorithm of what to invest their clients in depending on their specific situations. I am a financial advisor btw.. not just speaking out of my ass\n\nEDIT: Not to mention, local business and real estate may not also be what she\u2019s invested in. If I could express what my clients say about their portfolio and investments I can tell you they have no idea what the hell they are in no matter how many times I explain it to them. They only pick up certain things from the whole conversation. So for example, in OP\u2019s case, the advisor could have been talking about an REIT, which is a real estate investment trust. Definitely two different things from raw real estate to an REIT. If you\u2019re not financially literate with stocks then you may have a hard time explaining it like OP. Again, the things you\u2019d hear from clients talking about their investments is crazy lol",

It's only 10.5% a year. 15% year over year is 205% growth.  \n\n\n\\~Actual S&P went up 123%, and 123% growth from 480k is 1070k  \n\n\n\\~She didn't just double her money, it went from 480k to 1 million, so she had 108% growth.  \n\n\n\\~Rule of 70 is off at low % and high %. Rule of 70 says it takes 4.5 years to double at that rate when it takes 5. However if we take the rate of 10.5% a year, rule of 70 says its 7 years.  \n\n\nTL:DR She lost about 1 years growth, or 70k, depending on how you want to put it.",

A substantial portion of the reason your savings haven't been growing like they could be, is because he is taking a commission on the account.  These fees often absorb roughly a third of your pre-fee returns.  There's an inherent conflict of interest in play here: he's never going to send your business away from himself.  Asking him where you might do to get better results will get nowhere except cause hard feelings.\n\nI suggest taking your time, first of all.  The status quo is fine for now.  Money not growing fast enough is hardly an emergency.  However, you can start learning about investing on your own.  Check out the Bogleheads (start with their [videos](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Video:Bogleheads%C2%AE_investment_philosophy)) as a good first stop.  A total market index at Vanguard for example would cut your expenses to close to nothing, and get you far more diversified than it sounds like Keith has got you, which adds safety (think: what if that energy company had tanked?)  This is an area where there's definitely a \"best practice\" approach, and it's not too hard to learn.  Many people can do it without an advisor, even.  Good luck.",

To compare how much he'll actually costs in the long run vs. a do it yourself approach, compare the two.  Use this calculator (and play with return numbers to compare the two:  [https://www.begintoinvest.com/expense-ratio-calculator/](https://www.begintoinvest.com/expense-ratio-calculator/) \n\nPut in .1% for a self-managed Expense Ratio (the VTSAX crowd is at .03%), and X% for what he's charging you and the expense ratio of the funds you're in (to test it out, try entering 1.5% which is about average).  At 1.5%, over the last 7 years alone, he's cost you almost $80k.  \n\nAdvisors are great at preventing you from panic selling, and making you feel comfortable, but when comparing the numbers, are they worth THAT MUCH?  Otherwise, a Boglehead approach (easy to figure out) or target date fund may be for you.  That's for you to decide.",

If her husband had his doubts before about whether his wife respected him, now he has confirmation that she does not. But maybe that doesn't matter in the context of their relationship. He'll have to give it a think and get back to her.\n\nBut either way, this money isn't life-changing so I hope he doesn't try to talk her into spending a bunch of it. It's not even one person's retirement fund yet, let alone two.\n\nDespite OP's patronizing attitude, she was right to save and invest it. I just think she maybe could have had a *single* conversation after getting married where she said something like, \"By the way, I have some money saved away for retirement, in case it ever comes up.\" (and then never confirm how much it is and refuse all attempts to break into it for trivial expenses) Could have saved some headache here. Sometimes a partial truth is better than an omission.",

So theoretically you\u2019d have to make 5.75million from your 250k investment just so that your $1 million would still be worth the same. Do you have any money sense? Someone making $6000 a year in 1972 is equivalent to someone making 40k a year today. So if you\u2019re saying you would have $20k a year to spend for 50 years, think again. It would be more like 10-15k a year. And to your second point, you say that but most people would be pretty damn miserable if they never had anything to do",

If your spouse is hiding a million dollars, what the fuck else are they hiding? It's one thing to hide this while dating, to make sure the person isn't after your money, but hide it for 7 years of marriage is pretty nuts. It would be one thing if she told him about it, but for the secret to be forced out is another issue entirely too.",

They\u2019re married that money should be shared. I didn\u2019t mean to imply you wouldn\u2019t have to work, you still would, but if this guys wife used some of that money to help with bills and other expenses, he could keep more of his income to himself. Now I don\u2019t know how their incomes compare but it just seems so wrong to hide something like that from your partner. If she wants to keep that money to herself, then okay, tell him about it and then split your finances, you don\u2019t get to choose what money you share and what money you don\u2019t, that\u2019s not how it works. I don\u2019t understand how you think that\u2019s reasonable? And secondly as for her roi, she just hit $1 million because one of her investments doubled, how bad is the rest of her portfolio doing? $400k worth of spy would be worth $1.4 million right now, so yeah I\u2019d say she\u2019s not doing too great",

Hiding a million dollars from your significant other shows you have no respect for them. You think so little of them that you can\u2019t trust them to tell them something so important to a marriage? \nI would love to hear your opinion on divorce proceedings. Did you know most men experience a 10-40% decrease in standard of living after divorce as a result of alimony? Women act as though they are entitled to money their husband earns while they are married, which legally they are. Legally this man could be entitled to 50% of 520k. So technically she\u2019s hiding 260k of his own money from him. \nEither way it\u2019s not about what they would have done with the money, it\u2019s the fact that she hid it from him for 7 years while potentially having shared finances. \nPlus if OP actually discussed this with someone such as their family or husband, maybe they could\u2019ve done something more useful with the money. Because whatever you say, this investment underperformed in comparison to the rest of the market, it easily could\u2019ve been worth at least 50% more. So your comment about it being a bonus that she\u2019s \u201csmart\u201d is just untrue, a \u201csmart\u201d person wouldn\u2019t be investing half a million in local businesses",

If not why not just invest in index funds? Every market wide pull back has recovered making spy risk nearly zero. It was most definitely not the winners choice. Why won\u2019t you just stop saying OP and admit it\u2019s you? You\u2019ve had to have commented at least 100 times across this thread in various different arguments, no one has that much interest in something random.

The origins of the money is unimportant, I would personally think that the fact that she won it is more reason to share it. She didn\u2019t do anything to earn the money, it just fell in her lap. She\u2019s sitting up on her high horse talking about how her husbands terrible with money while she goes on about investing half a million dollars in local businesses. Her roi is horrible so maybe she should stop being so condescending. I don\u2019t know their situation but I\u2019m assuming the husband works. How would you feel if in 5 years you found out your partner had $1 million that they were keeping from you this whole time? You\u2019d probably feel pretty stupid, and cheated that you\u2019ve been working your ass off for years when there\u2019s always been money there. I\u2019ll say it again, I don\u2019t know the dynamic of their relationship, but if she makes less money than her husband she is essentially taking money from him while sitting on a massive sum of money",

Its a double edged sword- your partner hid a massive lie from you because they think youre incompetent, bonus points its about a million dollars and through sheer luck you found out. I know how i would feel as their partner- absolutely embarrassed and upset. Those feelings will be coming.\n\n A good spouse is honest- hey i won 480 000 dollars, also i reckon you're not great with money so lets have a chat about letting it grow in an investment. Don't treat your partner like a child.  This is a big betrayal and it will have ramifications for their relationship in the future, we're not doing OP any favours patting them on the back and blaming the advisor.\nOP may have been smart with their money but they were downright disrespectful with their relationship.\n\nEdit: changed \"wife\" to \"partner\" for inclusivity. Corrected money value.\nEdit2: Thank you everyone for your upvotes and award.",

Especially given that it incentives OP to believe she was right in hiding something so big from him (bc he's not mature enough to handle it basically) and should do so again in the future if need be. \n\nShe justified it by saying she was legally single...she was engaged tho and already in a verbal agreement to become life partners and she conspired to hide it. That shows a very high level of distrust towards her partner in my eyes. I mean hopefully she's gotten over that distrust in 7 years of marriage but now the husband has been made aware of that initial distrust and it's his turn to deal with it. \n\nIt sucks cuz maybe the husband thinks he can't be mad at her because ultimately this money benefits him as well as her. But it seems like she wouldn't have told him if she hadn't been caught.....which is yet another reason to be mad and wonder what else his wife is hiding. This is a multi layered issue. Even the fact that she hid it from him suggests that she saw it as her money and not theirs. I bet this is not going to be something that goes away in a week. This guy will be discovering new layers to this problem for a while unless he just commits to forgetting about it.",

This is why prenups exist. Op received this cash before they were married, why did she choose to lie and hide instead of signing a prenup? \n\nAgain: the money was received before marriage and was *never* intermingled with anything they gained together during marriage. It would be incredibly difficult for the husband to try and take anything from that money. In fact op lying and hiding the money actually may have pushed the divorce in favor of the husband if he decided he wanted to divorce her and take up more assets that they had earned together. \n\nIt\u2019s slimey scummy behavior. When is an acceptable time to share the information? How old does he have to be? Or will she just hide her million dollar retirement fund and force him to just use his own? How was this expected to play out? \n\nIf he has no access to the account and it wasn\u2019t merged upon marriage he couldn\u2019t do shit with it.

What you said about working more time is ok cause later it will pay off is something I disagree with. \n\n95 is way above average lifespan my dude. A lot of people don't even want to live that long because it just becomes a pain. You lose your physical and mental capacities. More importantly you lose the people you love. If he truly lives to 95, his wife would have been most likely dead for quite some years. I would have rather died than live alone like that. This is why the money is inconsequential in your presented argument. And if he does have kids, well yea the money will benefit them, but he will still have lost time working rather than raising them and enjoying their company. Doesn't matter how much time, it's still time lost. This doesn't mean I support being indulgent, but I believe we need to be sensible when if comes to life. Money helps, but it isn't everything.\n\nUltimately, communication is most important in any relationship. There was no reason to hide such information. If there was a problem, it should have been addressed, not swept under the rug.",

Unless your spouse is self aware, telling them about it and then asking them to stay away is a confirmation that you don't trust them. As long as it isn't a bad secret (cheating, gambling and losing the house, etc.) there's nothing wrong. If the spouse isn't self aware, you telling them and then asking them to stay away is obvious confirmation that you don't trust them, eventually leading to other conflicts.

But I have to say, don't keep secrets from your spouse, except what you got them for their birthday. This is certainly nothing to break up over, but it creates a feeling of inequality, like you know what's best anyway so you don't include him in the decision process. At the beginning of our relationship, my wife told me that her car insurance didn't allow other people to drive her car - a lie. She did it because she didn't want me to ask her to borrow her car for festivals, because she was worried her car could get damaged. When I found out I was pretty hurt that she thought I would respect it if she told me she wasn't comfortable with it. Moral of the story, be honest with your partner, and if they don't respect your feelings and decisions, they probably shouldn't be your partner to begin with.",

The proof is at the bottom of this message in the link to Portfolio Visualizer.\n\nI wouldn't be too mad at yourself, lots of advisors make people believe they can handle their funds, but very, very few people can beat the market return and that number shrinks every year. Be safe with your money going forward. Missing out on 400,000 because you went with Keith instead of a low-cost index fund compounds every year.\n\nAssuming you have another 20 years until retirement, that mistake will cost you 1,600,000 at 7% Growth for 20 years. Keith cost you and your husband 1,600,000 dollars.\n\nr/Bogleheads\n\n[Boglehead Portfolio Backcheck](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=2014&firstMonth=1&endYear=2021&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=480000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=800&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=2&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&leverageType=0&leverageRatio=0.0&debtAmount=0&debtInterest=0.0&maintenanceMargin=25.0&leveragedBenchmark=false&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=true&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&benchmark=VFINX&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Growth+Portfolio&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Growth+Portfolio&symbol1=VTSAX&allocation1_1=100&allocation1_2=0&allocation1_3=0&symbol2=VT&allocation2_1=0&allocation2_2=100&allocation2_3=0&symbol3=VOO&allocation3_1=0&allocation3_2=0&allocation3_3=100)",

He's not just a boyfriend, but a man who took a Vow before God, his family, and hers, to Love, hold and protect her w his life if need be. And that's how she deceived him. For At Least a Decade.

His $, is OUR $$.\nAnd her $$, is Her $$. Again? Why is that ok? \n\n3) She was soooo selfish and anti partner, she Never..never considered him? Her own fckn husband?\nShe didn't take $500? A thousand? And invest that for him?\nMaybe using the same things in her portfolio?\nOhhhh, hey honey, I got a great tip on some stocks...and invested $500 for you..here ya go ..he blow thru it?

But, whatever.\nI'm no Incel. They are generally a bunch of awkward, lonely women blaming losers, who can talk about what's wrong w everyone but themselves, Especially blaming women.\nNot my bag, not by a longshot. That was an offensive insult.\n\nWe disagree. Doesn't mean I hate you, or am mad at you.\nIt's not that deep. You, your opinion is still valued and respected in my book. We just disagree.\nTake care.",

Sorry if I sound a little harsh but:    \n     \n\nEveryone keeps saying how OP did the right thing by keeping it from their husband and how smart it was, money (!) wise.     \n    \n     \nMany people have a tendency to spend too much money. That's why when you marry someone, you usually make sure you can communicate with them well enough and trust them enough not to be spending YOUR half a million dollars without your consent. Damn, find an agreement, TALK, maybe sign something if necessary but don't just straight up lie to your partner.     \n    \n    \nIf my partner would've kept this from me, I would not trust them for a very long time and question whether we were compatible. Because money affects our life together greatly and changes a LOT, if they don't talk to me about it that's a deal breaker. My money is our money and the other way around and we agree on how we're spending and splitting it together. And if they actually divorced me then - as some are suggesting - because they wanted to make sure I don't get a dime, well thank God I dodged this bullet.\n    \n    \nAlso: OP, you don't seem as if you actually believe you fucked up, you defend and explain yourself, you're just mad he found out. So honestly, this is a \"TKFU\" from your perspective because Keith fucked up. But okay, congratulations for making a very smart decision money wise. I hope it's worth a damaged marriage.",

Others keep their own accounts and only pay what is required for shared costs. I personally did a 65% into a shared account and kept the rest without the other having any say over it in my last relationship. \n\nIf I went into a relationship where the other person got a large inheritance before we moved in together (*or something similar like a lottery winning*) I would not feel like I had any claim to that money.",

Of course I am not talking about a few months relationship here, but at the very least tell them about what you got when you get MARRIED and discuss it! Same goes for debt btw since marriage in most countries means merging funds and building a life together.    \n    \nIf they insist they deserve to SPEND the money for themselves and it's absolutely nothing you would even consider, you can part ways - even tho I'd personally feel a little weird spending 100% of a lottery win for nothing but my own stuff but ok, that's personal taste. So yeah, I'm not trying to shame anyone into having to spend your own saved money on a partner's wishes, all I'm trying to say is: just be honest and talk to your husband God damn",

We have clear financial boundaries (shared expenses on a shared credit card, everything else separate), and there\u2019s no problem. Other than being concerned he would spend it on consumer goods, you never indicated that he would nag you, bully you for the money, or leave if you didn\u2019t hand it over, which indicates to me that he would have been fine knowing about it but not having access to it. So why lie? The lying is a serious issue to me. I\u2019d also be pretty mad if I found out my partner was lying to me in the lead up to our wedding.\n\nAlso, don\u2019t co-mingle your funds now by paying for emergency bills and other things.

I would think about the fact that I spent 7 years stressing about money and working like a dog thinking I was piss poor while you had a big pile of cash that I didn't think about.

Hopefully, time will heal the hurt (I'm not even sure if the \"vacation\" is a good idea just about now since that will just remind you of the money)\n\nThe worst thing you could do now is to sweep this under the rug and pretend nothing happens.

It's money that can ensure a nice house or comfortable retirement, but not an ongoing lifestyle. \n\nLet's say you married at 30; you can expect to live to 85 or 95. The stock market will have its ups and downs, so you cannot guarantee that it will double forever like it has the last 6 years. $1M over 50 years? $20,000 a year. If you draw it down as it multiplies, let's say $40,000 or $50,000 a year later but not now. Nice, but not Beverly Hills Mercedes lifestyle.  Barely \"don't have to work any more\" lifestyle. The only thing it would do is supplement other income to make life easy enough that you would have fewer money woes. \n\nI heard a local radio DJ talking - he and his partner won $1M. (Tax free in Canada). He still goes to work, so does she; just if they want a nicer car or a more luxurious vacation - they can afford it.\n\nI read a whole thread once about how lottery winners are harassed by everyone from family and friends to complete strangers who come out of the woodwork begging for a handout. Good for you for avoiding that.",

I actually sort did a mini version of this a couple times in the past. \n\nYears ago, when I got a raise at work, I modified my direct deposit to put $50-$100/check into an account my wife didn't know about.  It was our vacation fund.  After a year or so, we were talking about taking a Disney Cruise and I said Why don't you get some quotes and figure out a budget.  This was strange because I'm usually the cheap one.  Once we had some details, I let her know about the $2000 in the bank account I had been keeping separate.  She was a bit shocked at first, but we had a great vacation.\n\nI had also done a bunch of things online to make some extra cash and ended up deciding to get a bunch of Disney gift cards with the money.  Back in 2019, we had a similar conversation and I let her know I had $1000-$2000 in Disney gift cards I'd been stashing away.  We ended taking an amazing vacation just after Thanksgiving in 2019.  Probably the best vacation we've ever had.  A few months later Covid happened so we were very glad we took the trip when we could.\n\nObviously, having $2000 stashed away is completely different than having $1 million stashed away, but as long as you do it for the right reasons, I think it's fine.  However, since you mentioned your husband has a tendency to spend money recklessly, you may be in for some tough conversations going forward.  If you're seriously worried about him blowing the money, keep it in your name only in your account with him not a signer, and let him know it's only there for retirement and not for buying a new house or car or anything else.\n\nGood Luck.",

They work full time jobs and do MLM's to try to make ends meet.    \n\n\nWhen I married my wife I said send your paycheck to my bank and I'll handle our financials. It's been 6 years and I sat her down and explained to her that we could retire at 52, and set more goals for even earlier retirements.  Shes super excited and had no idea how I did it. She doesn't care about the how. She of course told her family, who is now asking for money.  I tell them to sell their assets 1st before I shell a single dollar.  \n\n\nFYI, Watch your spending, Set goals, get a financial planner, and INVEST! compounding and time are your best friends.",

One of his siblings considered putting the money away so their spouse would not touch it, but decided not to. They blew through it - spending it eating out and at bars (they are in their 50s, not 20s). Once they blew through it, they filed for bankruptcy (the second time they've filed for bankruptcy). Another relative recently passed and everyone has received another significant inheritance. It is only a matter of time before they waste all of that on meaningless things also.\n\nHis sibling would have been much better off ensuring that money was invested for retirement, as their future now will be entirely based on social security and no other savings.",

We're all going to die someday and nobody gets to choose when that day is, could be tomorrow, so you should consider spending some of it.  I understand saving for retirement, kids, important stuff; and I also understand saving/investing money to grow your wealth.  But saving money by denying yourself a few small luxuries that make life easier I don't agree with.\n\nFor example, if I didn't have a deep freezer, I'd buy one because I never have enough room in the freezer compartment in the refrigerator.  If it takes a long time to dry your hair after a shower, buy a better hairdryer.  I would NOT spend it on some fancy car that will lose half its value as soon as you drive away with it.\n\nIf it were me, now that the money doubled, I would take out 10% and not a penny more.  That would be what I call a \"make life easier\" fund.  Don't pay loans/bills with it, still use your paychecks for that.  Examine you and your husband's daily routine and tasks that you do and think \"is there anything that could make this easier?\"  That's what you should spend it on.  Make life easier and you'll have a little less stress, a little more free time, and a little more happiness.  That's money well spent. \ud83d\udcb0",

Ultimately, the wife did make a smart move and had the good fortune of it being able to work out in a positive manner. There isn't a reasonable person in this thread who would disagree with that, minus the fact her financial advisor probably needs to be fired and that money reinvested more appropriately with a financial advisor who isn't gambling with their future. \n\nThere totality of circumstances, however, dictate the wife also should have discussed this a long time ago with her husband. Regardless of the fact that he agrees that if he had access to that money he would have spent it irresponsibly, the amount of it doesn't matter, the good fortune of it doesn't matter. What matters is she didn't trust or respect him enough to have that conversation at all. She's been in close enough contact with her financial advisor over the years that it isn't something she just set and forgot about to wake up one day to it becoming a payoff surprise, there's enough calculated decisions there over the course of many years on her end to know she didn't disclose that information at all. The conversation could have very easily been 'I have X amount of money locked up in an investment account, I got lucky back when I was single and didn't tell anyone because I didn't want to be pestered for money. That money is untouchable and if all else fails, it is our nest egg for the future', conversation done.",

I just wanted to have a second go at it in hopes I can convince you better.\n\nYour perspective : You hid away your earnings - shitty move to not trust your husband. But it paid off, there\u2019s a million $ in your account now! Awesome.\n\nYour husband\u2019s short term perspective : My wife of xyz years hid her wealth from me. I didn\u2019t notice , I feel so stupid. I may have exhausted that money\u2026 it\u2019s a million dollars - maybe it\u2019s a good thing.\n\nSeems easy to overcome right? But as non-billionaires every single one of us makes a trade off multiple times a day - right from the kind of coffee we drink, the kind of clothes we wear and petty things we decide to put up with.\n\nUnfortunately, There is no bigger thing that defines who we act like apart from money.\n\nRight now you lying is the biggest thing to him but as he overcomes it and comes to term with the other side of you - there will be a loss of locus on control on his end that every aspect of how he behaved in the past 7 years was controlled solely by a single decision you made. \n\nSomething like can this can easily break his persona and your marriage.\n\nHim saying that everything is ok and we can move on is not the end but the beginning. Please take preemptive measures to not ruin what both of you have.\n\nIt was a horrible choice to hide it from him and the worst part is that even when it did come out - you weren\u2019t the person to tell him. This is cold hard truth that will exist forever in your relationship henceforth, it\u2019s not going to be the same ever but it can still be beautiful enough to keep you two together.\n\nWish you the best.",

I'd also feel like you're now aware that my calculus of the power dynamic in the relationship has changed and this would have on me the unfortunate effect of changing my behavior. I'd also have so many more questions than you're really ready for.\n\n\nFor starters, what else are you hiding from me, is it just money? Now im wondering what else meets the qualifications that im not even aware of for you to hide something? Do you withdraw from this account and use it to fund an alternative relationship with someone else? You left a huge opening for questions you might not want to have to answer just based on seeing where the mind of someone who was lied to goes when they try to fill in the gaps themselves- its not with fairy dust, it's with mutual distrust-\"what is it that she felt the need to hide, obviously nothing good\" is basically the first and focused line of thinking all men go down. You really should have been the one to surprise him with it, finding out you hid it and (\"only\") another man knows about it - Keith. Who now also knows your a millionaire, again to the male mind, this does not lead good, positive, or happy places. \n\nYou fucked up, big.

Regardless of money, bad spending habits or anything else, knowing the above would give most rational people (I\u2019m assuming here) a huge reason for pause. Your husbands forgiveness is no justification for such disregard in a healthy relationship either so maybe reflect on that a bit since it seems you haven\u2019t had to too much thanks to your husbands relatively quick forgiveness. Not trying to throw shade at forgiveness here btw, I\u2019m just saying try and actually learn something from this instead of just forgetting and moving on.

You two (making an inference) have a reasonable life where you are not living hand to mouth.  You didn't waste the money but rather acted wisely with it.  Your husband has learned that you guys are 1 million richer than he originally thought.  You have an additional reasonable cushion (the money) against your old age needs.\n\nFuck him.  and tell him to keep his hands off of it (since you have done so well with it -- that ultimately benefits both of you).",

I don't understand why you wouldn't have discussed this with him before this point, as choosing not to tell someone in the moment as something happens and keeping it from them for an extended period of time are two very different things, but I hope you guys can communicate better now moving forward.\n\nHey, at the end of the day, if my partner decides to keep secrets from me I'd rather it be a mystery million they've got stashed away instead of gambling debts or infidelity. So as annoyed as he has every right to be... I'm sure he'll come around. Just don't let him believe you're keeping anything else from him and don't patronise him with the concept of the money because of what you know he can be like. Won't end well for the relationship",

And like you would trust a person enough to marry them, but not enough to say this, but you also can't just say, we're leaving it in the account, if that's what you wanted to do? The investment choice also makes no sense. Investing through a credit union? And why is a credit union suggesting these kinds of products? How exactly do you 'invest in local business'? With only that much money. It's not enough to cover start-up costs for one business. Would Keith be running around writing up lending contracts or part ownership terms for small percents? Who would sign those kinds of contracts? Why not just go through a bank which can probably offer better terms? Other things like depositing lotto winnings as a check in a local credit union. And then being a super secret person, but feeling the need to blab to Reddit about it, giving away key details like time of year for lotto winning and marriage. And then to top it all off, classic story structure of male vs female power dynamic to get the Reddit drama flowing. Where we know if the genders were reverse the argument would go the opposite direction. \n\nYeah, I doubt all of this.",

This reminds me of when the in-laws gifted us $10K in the early 90\u2019s and my husband who has always had hang ups about money never told me. I worked full time with two kids and he at the time was job hopping around trying to find something permanently. So one day I\u2019m having the in-laws over for dinner and MIL says to me \u201caren\u2019t you ever going to say thank you\u201d?! Obviously confused I said ok thank you-but for what exactly so we\u2019re talking about the same thing??  For the $10K she excitedly exclaimed!  What $10K I asked now thoroughly confused.  I look over at my husband and you can see him dying inside. MIL proceeds to slap him across the back of the head and schools him on how a husband should never put money before marriage and yadda yadda yadda. I know this is a huge departure from OP\u2019s situation bc the money was apparently gifted to both of us but like I said the story triggered the memory. We are still married btw. I eventually let it go. He\u2019s very good to me in other ways. So compromise is everything in long term relationships.  Im now retired (he still working FT) and went on to make a very comfortable living with substantial savings.  I never needed their money-I earned my own but husband learned a very valuable lesson that day. The sight of my MIL biffing him was worth the embarrassment his non disclosure caused.",

      "text": "So my marriage had a related problem and it was one of the things that I believe contributed to it ending after 18+ years.  \n\nMy former wifes parents were rich.. they had somewhere in the maybe the low million to several hundred thousand so not super rich but well off.  Her dad earned it honestly through him building companies then selling them off and through patents for the products his company sold.  I grew up fairly well off when I was young but then poor when I was in my teenage years when my parents divorced and my mother moved us to the back woods of Arkansas.  This led me to constantly plan for the long term and being interested in not wasting money on frivolous temporary things (like trips or expensive meals) and wanting to make sure we had savings for emergencies.  This was all well and good while I was in the military till I separated and we moved back home.. and by home I meant back to her home city where her parents and her had lived her entire life before she married me and moved around with my military commitments.  \n\nI wanted to be entirely self sufficient and prove that we weren't reliant on my in laws.. my wife on the other hand was happy to take their generosity... One thing was our house.. her parents bought the house and let us live there..  when we moved in we signed a generous rent agreement for only 500 a month for something that easily could have gone for 2-3 times that much.  Come to find out later my wife never paid them the rent.. it was all just for them to use as tax losses to shield their income from taxes.  \n\nAs I always was focused on earning and saving enough to retire at some point she would constantly tell me that when/if anything happened to her parents she would get her portion and not I.. This always confused me and I would also remind her that I am making sure we are ready even if they left us nothing.  After a few years trying to work in Arkansas I realized I was never going to earn my potential there and went into Government contracting where I am no making good money.  It required moving a few hours and one state away.\n\nThe plan had always been once I got established our family would move to be with me.  This took around a year.. for a year I was coming home most weekends and maybe once a month they would come down.  It was a good place (where we were stationed when we first got married) and we had previously lived here 8+ years.\n\nOnce my contracting position became more long term and I was confidant in long term income to purchase a house I asked her if she was willing to move down with me.  She adamantly refused.. she was not going to leave her home town and she was happy living off her familys money and generosity.  \n\nSo how does this long story contribute to our divorce and what does it have to do with OPs situation??  Many marriages only continue due to financial reliance.  If someone is reliant on another person for their wellbeing they will suffer some hardships to stick with them.  In my case my now ex-wife was being well cared for by her parents and had little reliance on my income or retirement plans (not that this didnt stop her from asking for alimony during our divorce).  I have very little animosity to my x and we still have a good relationship based around our children.  But in OPs case financial reliance and independence could play a significant role in the husbands case.  Knowing that the other person could leave them at anytime and suffer no hardship is kinda scary to someone.  The fact that something like this was hidden also plays a major part.  Its kinda like someone had an escape plan and could have been planning to milk the relationship for what they can receive without giving equal back. I'm not saying that OP was ever planning to do this but that could be what scares and bothers the husband.  Secrets rarely go over well in marriages.. Its like building a house on shaky unreliable ground.. once the secret is out then you have to see what you have remaining.",

I think you prepared for an inevitability, and your husband is still not mature enough to deal with his own shortcomings.  If he had to stay with a friend/coworker in order to think things out, deal with his feelings, or whatever he wants to call it, that says something about him, not about what you did.  His response, in my opinion, only lends more credence to the reasoning as to why you kept quiet about it.  His assumption that you both have a communal million dollars is a bit of a stretch, as legally in most states, he would only have rights to half of what was made after you were married, even less if you get a good lawyer, if things come to that.",

He could feel that he has no right to be angry and is suppressing his feelings. Obviously that's no good. Feelings under pressure turn to resentment. If you value your marriage, ask your husband to go to therapy with you",

But when My dog broke her leg and the vet bill was $1300 he took it out of his own pocket and had it in my account the same day.  In the interim since I'm 'retired' I've been living on retail wages because I wanted to be 100% sure she was there for the long haul.  She has no idea that she walked away from a million plus, a paid for nice house, two late model cars, and could pretty much live a life of luxury for the rest of her life.  Hope that dick she slipped and fell on was worth it.  I have no idea what I'm going to do with the money now.  Probably just let it continue to grow.  I make enough on my work from home job and side projects to live well enough for me.  And no my Reddit friends I will not be sending you any money.  I earned it and I plan to keep it.  I'll probably give up on working in 5 years and just play with all the toys I intend to buy and grow my gardens.\n\nI hope your husband calms down and sees the intelligence of your decision.",

Any time I've brought up budgeting something nice for myself - a sports car, a new home office setup, etc, it completely ruins us  for  the next 48 hours because the resentment comes out.I don't think it's necessarily all her fault -  I think it's really tough for people with limited  resources to be adjacent to resources of several orders of magnitude more of it than they've ever seen in their life.\n\nWe're working through things now but honestly some days I wish I could hit the undo button.

Which gives you less of an out for not being transparent unless you weren\u2019t even engaged in August in which case I would say fair grounds not to disclose. It\u2019s hard bc it depends on how you handle your finances in general. See my spouse and I contribute amounts to mutual savings, bills, mutual debt but we also have personal savings, bills we handle and I think if this money was solely mine coming into the marriage and I had already invested it etc. than I\u2019d tell him bc I think he\u2019d be okay w me just keeping it where it was. Ultimately it would be both if ours bc we\u2019re married, but in a practical sense it would be mine barring we were going down like a sinking ship and needed a bail out. \n\nThe whole thing is tricky bc on the one hand you\u2019ve set yourselves up w some really substantial savings which takes some possible burden off of having enough for the future. On the other hand you\u2019ve been straight up lying for 8 years\u2026I mean if you\u2019re filing jointly on taxes does the investment affect what you otherwise owe or get back? If so how do you justify w/holding that info? Also another commenter made a good point, what if something happened to you is the money set up to go to your husband? Do you guys have kids, what about them? Would your hubbs have just gotten a random check or a call from Keith and be completely thrown?\n\nI \ud83d\udcaf get that you feel your hubbs spends unecessary money, but there should be an agreement that he\u2019s either using personal money on these purchases or you both have to agree to them right??? And there should be an amount of savings and debt paying that you both agree to that these purchases would fall outside of right?\n\nI don\u2019t know sounds like maybe a lot of communication breakdown. So if you wanted to come at it from a place that it was a mistake, but not just on your part, bc as a whole it sounds like you guys weren\u2019t having needed and reasonable financial discussions that included disclosing each other personal monies and debts than maybe he\u2019d feel better about the whole thing? \n\nGood luck!!!",

If he becomes insistent that something happen to this money that would convert it into a marital asset my alarm bells would start going off. You have done nothing inconsistent with managing this money to improve your life together. There is no reason to be suspicious of your motives or actions. Be absolutely certain you can say the same of him. Make sure he is the death beneficiary (if that\u2019s what you want) but otherwise leave it with Kieth.  I have a great deal of professional experience with the effect money can have on couples and it has left me jaded. Expect the best, plan for the worst.\n\nEDIT:  I am reading the responses here and seeing a ton of dangerous \u2018legal\u2019 advice.

I am iffy on marriage, so personally I think that money is yours and to quote Michael Malice \u201cThere is no we here.\u201d\n\nThat being said, secrets and trust issues can have a negative impact on relationships. Ultimately I believe your husband needs to do most of the legwork on this one. I\u2019m happy that he\u2019s being honest about his would be decision making. I also think it\u2019s logical for him to need to process that his past actions led to compelling you to feel the need to keep this secret, and that you kept a rather important financial secret from him. Which, imo is a gray area. I still think personal finances are nobody else\u2019s business unless there\u2019s an explicit agreement that they are.\n\nI hope and think you two will be able to work it out. I hope he doesn\u2019t get greedy though. If he does, that justifies the secrecy. If he doesn\u2019t, then this issue should drop and y\u2019all should enjoy having more cushion for the livin!",

When he found out he hid everything in his name only after that. I didn\u2019t care because it was his money but I worked and paid for everything he ever got. Mortgage truck payments vacations. He spent his paycheck on lottery and Vegas. He and his sister rented out his moms house and he kept his share in his credit union at work. He never brought his paystubs or credit union statements home. He told me that the house never made money, only cost them. I went to his credit union because taxes were due and I didn\u2019t have enough and he kept putting off giving me his share. I asked for a print out of the past year too, only to find out he made money on the house and was taking $500 out a month. \nFast forward 3 more years, I find out he is a partner in small business with his poker buddies and keeping a condo near his work with a married woman he went to high school with.\nI asked him to get a HELOC with me so I could start a business and he won\u2019t because the house is paid off and wants to have spending money during his retirement. I work 12 hrs a day, 7 days a week and you best believe I will not be paying for anything else before his funeral.",

I've heard of financial infidelity before and marriage counselors take it pretty seriously, but you earned the money beforehand, and yes, it was something you probably should have discussed when you agreed to marry this man, especially during the part of the engagement where you each pull down all the drapes on your finances, which is actually something people to be married usually do. But it sounds like his feelings will be temporary, not damning, he'll forgive you for hiding a part of yourself, but if his hurt feelings ever come up in marriage counseling, the counselor will have a huge \"problem goose\" to feast upon, and will really investigate into what it means. Hopefully you haven't hidden anything else, and won't again. And hopefully this doesn't set a precedent to your husband that it's okay to have some huge financial secrets if he thinks it's for the best of his partner. Afterall...it was pretty cool when YOU did it, why not he?\n\nWhich brings me to the point that there are also clues hidden in your wording that you don't entirely trust your husband's financial side, and that's...well that's a touchy subject. I think there are better people than me to give advice on how to cover/broach that, if necessary, but it sounds like the root cause of your secretiveness. Go on vacation but stick to the budget of course and I think you're the money nerd in the relationship so you can keep the strongest head on finances. Honestly a well planned $10,000 vacation is just as a fan as a senseless splurging of a $50,000 one, in fact the former is probably more fun because the joy is all intentional.\n\nCongratulations on not ending up like a majority of lottery winners.",

It\u2019s a serious number but not an \u201cI can retire now number.\u201d  IMHO, assuming you\u2019ve both been getting by financially without the money, you did the right thing.  \n\nIf you were a couple who were including finances in planning your life together, I can get that your husband might feel a little weird that you left something that big out.  He might be thinking that he\u2019d have certainly told you.  That said, it\u2019s not like he\u2019s finding out about money that you used to have.  You still have it and it\u2019s GROWN!  I\u2019d be shocked if I suddenly found out my wife had >$1 mil tucked away in an investment account.  I think I\u2019d get over any weirdness pretty quickly and depending on what she wanted to do, try to forget about until we\u2019re closer to retirement.  I cannot promise I wouldn\u2019t try to talk her into a small celebration purchase over breaking into 7 figures.\n\nCongrats on your luck on the win and investment returns.  I hope everything goes well with your husband!  Hopefully the weirdness wears off soon and he can just be excited (in no small part because he married someone with a level head and who knew him well enough to assist in delayed gratification).",

Marriage is based on trust. Clearly there's a trust issue here. Once that is broken, it's darn near impossible to get back. At least not like it was. I'm sure I would get over it, but this is a pretty big pill to swallow. At least it would be for me. Not for the money reasons but trust reasons. Would it be enough to walk out on 17 years of marriage? No. Could I suppress the very logical thought of 'she didn't trust me enough to tell me about this. What else hasn't she trusted me enough to tell me about?' Sure, I would like to think so but it's Impossible to tell.",

That isn't something you text someone. Get a better financial advisor or at least have a very serious conversation with Keith about how he shares your personal information. It's super common for texts to show up on the screen of the phone or even in your car infotainment screen, not secure at all.\n\nAlso, a million dollars is a lot but not infinite wealth. Given your husband's over reaction, I think you should keep a close watch on that money. Your husband is probably already telling friends and they are telling more friends. You can spend it but do so keeping in mind short term enjoyment, long term enjoyment and potential surprises (kids, medical, employment, disasters, etc...).\n\nCongratulations, I feel you are now going to enjoy at least a little of your luck.",

You\u2019ve already taken her first bit of advice, which was to sit on it for some time and not make any drastic lifestyle changes.\n\nShe suggested hiring an accountant to track it, and a lawyer to handle legal concerns that crop up.\n\nShe also suggested dividing it into three portions. A third to spend, a third to invest, and a third for charity usage. In part to limit loss due to spending or charity.\n\nShe suggested that all charity be handled through the lawyer, who would collect the proper paperwork for taxes and reporting, but also serve as a firewall so you can refuse or limit a request without being the \u2018bad guy\u2019, especially when it comes to family. The lawyer would also handle whether it\u2019s a loan or gift, and what the appropriate methods would be for either case. (Sorry, my lawyer/accountant said we can\u2019t do that)\n\nIt also sounds from what others have said that you  might need to diversify you investments. It doesn\u2019t have to be large sums right away, but use some arbitrary amount across multiple methods and see what does or doesn\u2019t do well. You have enough time and money that you can spread some of it out, see what happens, then adjust the funds accordingly.",

The biggest reason for this is because of my family. Some of my family is not trustworthy and I don't want to take a chance on anything. Even the land and house we currently own is not under my name. I don't trust my family at all and won't take a risk on my immediate family future. I already lost money and a car to my Mom and stepdad around the time I got married. I am not the only one they screwed over. They shit they pulled on my niece, who ended up in jail because of it. Yah some family members can't be trusted.",

You understood that it is nobody's business but your own. However, marriage is a partnership so I see the other side of it too.\n\nMy thoughts are you probably should have told him once you were married. But specified that this is the nest egg. This is the money you pretend is not even there. It is retirement money. \n\nIt may also be a nice example for your husband to understand why saving is important. In eight years you more than doubled your money instead of buying things that would be obsolete or used up in that time. If he has not taken the time to learn budgeting and saving at this point in his life, you have every right to show him. I tend to fall on the much more conservative side of things financially. But showing my wife what you can do if you loosely budget, buy the upgrades when needed, and save to not be stressed about money has helped her to build better habits.",

I do really hope that you your husband is good and truly understands.  I've gotten to the point of saving instead of spending on crap and it's good you think the same way.  Keep that money put away and let it keep working for you.  The only concern I would have if I were in your situation is what happens if you get divorced?  Do you split it, prepare a prenup?

He should\u2019ve had you sign a pre-nup if he was worried about you leaving him (sorry most men aren\u2019t thinking about divorce before they are married). Divorce him and get what\u2019s yours, because IT IS YOURS. Take him for everything he\u2019s got, worst case scenario you\u2019ll get your half.  People hate deadbeats but people hate being called a deadbeat even more, so use the kids to your advantage. He\u2019s already sleeping on his friends couch, he won\u2019t mind staying there lol it\u2019ll be just like college again. Make sure you get alimony figured out, that money won\u2019t last as long as you think. \n\nPlease let any potential SO know early on that  your finances will be completely separate and for them to just deal with the fact you\u2019ll be hiding things from them. Secrets are like glue  for a relationship, they hold everything together. I hope every date you go on is split 50/50 to the point that you\u2019d raise hell if they paid even a penny more and you\u2019d never speak to them again. \n\nIt is for OUR future, they are married, everything they have is shared. How are you gonna marry someone and then not be open and upfront about everything? It\u2019s not like it\u2019s an astronomical amount, ffs it was $480,000 not $480 million. They don\u2019t need to tell them the bank account info or even where the money is parked. \u201cIt\u2019s invested and can\u2019t be touched for 10 years\u201d. Simple, honest and to the point.

      "text": "Okay, just a couple things:\n\n1.\n\n> I already have people messaging me asking if they can have money. Jesus. This is why I didn't tell anyone!!\n\nWell, this is reddit. Ain't no 14yo blow their chance on a couple bucks for not having asked the internet stranger. There's people out there spamming sob stories in the hopes of finding one of those people who offer financial or other help for free, so if someone freely admits to being pretty liquid, they're gonna swarm them. Just ignore. And yes, of course I know it's not just teenagers doing it unfortunately. One thing they do have in common though is that they'd be the worst people to ever give money to, might as well burn it.\n\n2.\n\n> My husband and I just spoke on the phone for about an hour. He told me he's staying with his best friend/coworker tonight but that he's not angry. He agreed he would have spent the money on dumb things if he'd won it and is happy that I put it away. Little less happy that I didn't tell him about it for so long, but he said he doesn't care and doesn't want this getting in the way of our marriage.\n\n\"Yeah, so you know how we've been married seven years and I love you with all my heart and all? Well now that I've found out that I not only have you but also a million bucks saved up, I can't deal with this, I'm out.\"\n\n(I know that's not what his feelings are about but I'd still consider it extremely odd for someone to terminate a relationship, not to mention a marriage, over something like this, and not because of the financial loss they'd make by not staying. They'd have to be **extremely** upset about their partner's opinion of their ability to not blow the money.\n\n.3. So something came up and suddenly I urgently need a couple grand, life or death, and, you know... jkjk... Unless? (sorry, had to throw that in somewhere. Hope you're handling the beggars alright and that's exactly the reason I would have made a throwaway for a post like this, because you can bet your ass there's gonna be occasional PMs for years to come asking for money. People suck. And you're also exactly right about your family, because family will not just want money, they'll think they have a claim to it.)",

I don\u2019t know your relationship, but it\u2019s not uncommon for someone with that personality to suddenly decide he may like that money more then you, and just be appeasing you while he determines how much he could be entitled to if you guys split.

So he understands that he'd blow through the money and you've more than doubled your investment. So what's he upset about? It would be beneficial to have a house that's paid for but imagine what another 8 years would do to the investment. You could use the dividends to pay the mortgage but overall this should be for retirement and know you both have a great cushion to fall back on. Maybe come to an agreement to buy him a lightly used sports car of his dreams, within reason, and for it to be the 3rd car that you both can enjoy.  And that the rest should stay as an investment.",

Not just personal, previous relationships, but also financial.\n\nApparently we are outliers in that everything we have is both of ours.  We work as a team and don't hide or keep anything from each other.  Money is a pool that's ours.  Not hers, not mine.\n\nAnything over $50, we discuss and confirm it's OK to buy.\n\n+22 years and it's made us stronger.",

      "text": "Other people's money changes people, often for the worst. I'm glad this has sort of worked out for you, but I caution you may have not heard the last of this. I have several examples, but here's one.\n\nI've been working toward early retirement the last dozen years, and I was always a saver and prepared for a rainy day (or several) before that. I had a girlfriend a few years ago and we were always more or less 50/50 when it came to spending money on things we did together. When we met, of course, she didn't know about my savings and retirement plans.\n\nI'm definitely more choosy and she's definitely more of a spendthrift. And she just likes the *idea* of luxury. She likes high end restaurants, spas, etc. \"just to say she's been there.\" I worked in fine dining when I was young, and other high end luxury stuff. I've seen behind the curtain. I know exactly what you get for all that money, and frankly, it rarely feels worth it to me. And luxury stuff just doesn't make me feel \"special\" like it does for some. \n\nSo fast-forward a year, and then she finds out. Over the months that follow, things change. Gradually the hole-in-the-wall hidden gem restaurant we loved to discover is no longer good enough. \n\n\"Why do you still have that phone ($250 android phone that does everything I need it to do)? Why don't you get the new iPhone?\" If my phone didn't get signal or had literally any kind of problem, \"That's why you should have got an iPhone.\" When her iPhone had those same problems, \"Well, obviously its the service, not the phone.\" \n\nWhen we went camping, which she loved to do, suddenly she's showing me a $400/night resort \"really close by\". \"If the weather turns out to be cold, we should keep this in mind.\" \n\n\"Don't you want to go to this spa? They totally pamper you.\" I explained I'd been a spa attendant at a luxury resort and got all that stuff free or nearly free, and yeah, it's nice, but it's not $500 in one day nice. \"Why don't you like to live a little?\" \n\nIt just went on and on like that. Death by a thousand cuts. If even I agreed to put up half of the luxury purchase, that was still met with sighs and \"oh never mind\". She wouldn't come right out and say it but it was all too clear - buy me stuff!\n\nI suggest you explain your plan with this money to him and what you intend to do with it. Talk about how much you consider \"untouchable\" and for retirement, and what can be touched before then and when. Literally the only thing that sometimes got her off my back was to show her, \"My savings goal is X. Everything after that I spend freely. Therefore, I can't afford a $300 dinner. I can afford to *split* a $300 dinner, so if you want it that bad, you have to put up your half.\" She didn't *like it* but she *accepted it*. \n\nWhether you want it to or not, the money shifts the power dynamic in the relationship, particularly since it's pre-marital assets. With some people when it comes to money, they're like dogs when it comes to food: if you put food in the bowl, they're going to eat it. They only way to limit what the dog eats is to not put it in the bowl. I don't mean this in a bad way, but if your spouse is as spend-for-today as you say, expect him to be coming to you a lot with the food bowl in his mouth asking you to fill it. And if he does, like me, you will start to get tired of it and you will start to view your spouse differently, like the only reason they're with you is because you occasionally fill that bowl.",

It's 2022 people do crazy shit to the ones they \"love\" over financials and also he did not do a thing to help you acquire the money ( unless he bought you the ticket) and even then that doesn't mean shit.\n\nIt sucks its awkard but seriously congrats!
