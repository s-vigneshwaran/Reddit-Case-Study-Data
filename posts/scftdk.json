The result was only 9% thought that the name of the school was very important and 79% thought an applied skill was important. \n\nIf you find the 9% then that better college is going to set you apart. For the rest of the 91%, it doesn't matter where you went to school. It is dumb that evidence exists and you still deny reality. I am done arguing facts to you, anything you say at this point is moot. How about you start investing your time in figuring out how to apply the shit you learned in school.",
