In those low tax brackets you cannot likely afford property for property tax. Highest state tax is around 9% if you are in that lower income level. \n\nSo sounds like less than 30% taxes for you even if we add it up. \n\nI do understand your exaggeration for a point, it is a lot of our income. But the US has the lowers tax rates of all developed nations, so the rest of the worlds citizens pay more than you do. (Except almost every other country has a 0% tax rate as their lowest rate because the citizens understand that people in poverty need some help and the wealthy should pay a bit more). \n\nBut the main difference is that people in other countries think they are actually getting something good in return for their taxes compared to the US where most of ours goes to benefit some shareholders of some mega corporation. \n\nI hope you do get into a 60% tax rate some day, cause that would mean you are making a huge amount of money, or maybe you moved out of the US.",

All churches don\u2019t behave in a way that Reddit thinks they do because of Joel osteen. And now that I\u2019m grown, my coworkers church is CONSTANTLY doing things. She comes to work and asks if we know anyone to send to their giveaway or whatever it is you want to call it. They stay giving stuff back. Food, water, clothes, lotion, deodorant, etc. the church i grew up in, back home & my family still goes to, gave a big school giveaway. I\u2019m from a town of probably 1000. This church doesn\u2019t have any money \u2026 at all. Rural area so the tithing isn\u2019t always that great. The church is probably 60 people max and gave to anyone, not just people who go to the church. It was an event at a park and they grilled food and all. So sure more churches do need to be transparent, not disagreeing but it doesn\u2019t mean that some already aren\u2019t. And i still feel the same pressure should be on all nonprofits like goodwill who pays their ceo substantially. Don\u2019t leave the other nonprofits out \ud83d\ude0a",

I left another comment and i was born and raised in these churches. I don\u2019t live back home anymore and they just had a huge ass cookout and back to school gives away in august. This is a rural church in a town of less than 1000. And they shared their accounting. I don\u2019t need to review more because i grew up in church and i don\u2019t get my info from Reddit. Furthermore now that i don\u2019t go to church, my coworker is always inviting people or asking us to send people when her church gives away food, water and all other commodities. I don\u2019t lack understanding of things i live even today \u2026 i don\u2019t even go to church to know these things. My family is still in that church back home\u2026 and just like my coworkers church, they give to ANYONE. You don\u2019t need to support nor pay in. They\u2019re there to pull in the community and bring them up and never once try to get you to become a Christian when you come to the events. There are bad apples of course as with anything else in this world. No one needs to tell me anything, and i don\u2019t know why you assumed that. The same church i grew up in was also the church giving away for Christmas every year\u2026 to anyone.",

Like, it wasn't worth the same as a super car or anything like that, but it wasn't particuarly cheap with the money he put into it.  But, the dude was just also into cars, he's allowed to do his job, save money and spend it on stuff he likes to do that isn't jesus related, though I remember him joking once that he measured the gas mileage in Prayers per mile or something, which I thought was funny.  And like, regardless of what you think about religion, the majority of pastors I have known are actually educated in theology, and while you might consider it a bullshit topic, it's just as much bullshit as 12th century literature IMO.  And they do a lot more than just talk out of their ass every Sunday.  \n\nI always feel weird defending churches, but I think blanket assumptions about them are no good.\n\nedit:  He was kind of know for this car and how much he loved it, and was also known in the local 'car scene' as just another dude that was into cars.

There are plenty of studies that show the amount of money spent on a particular political activity directly impacts the success of that endeavor.  Sure, there are third-rail topics that are ridiculous no matter how much money you throw at it, there are plenty where a company like Goldman Sachs can say, money well spent.  \n\nYour statement also overlooks think tanks like the Heritage Foundation that have numerous billionaire donors and are absolutely key to the conservative take over of the federal judiciary.  \n\nIn other words, the ability to spend money is equivalent to a voice in government.  Your statement that \"corporations don't have a voice in government\" is not correct.",

I think most religions start with good intentions but tend to go off the rails when those in control figure out how much money and power it can bring.

If you think about Christianity was a wierd cult for several hundred years. The power shifted when Emporer Theodocious responded poorly to a revolt and put several thousand people to death. He was chastised for this and seeked forgiveness from the bishop Ambrose and that ultimately signaled that the power on earth could be subservient to the Power of God, from there things went downhill in Europe quite quickly.",

I've posted in this sub showing biblical arguments *against* various Christian positions, and was accused by my fellows of being a \"Christian shill.\"  I do this for Christian lurkers trying to break free, seeking answers.  \n\nI want a million dollars a week, and could point them toward a \"loving and prosperous life\"; I can cherry-pick, mix and match with the best of them.  \n\nHowever, unlike Osteen, I have an ethical code driven by an unshakable morality.  I'm unable to \"lie for Jesus\" to the gullible for the sole purpose of attaining massive amounts of Caesar's coin.\n\nOsteen is a wolf; he plants himself and sells Jesus for personal gain.  He does not go on missions \"spreading the good word,\" help his neighbors in a flood, or use his gain for the poor, sick, dying or homeless. He passes them by in his half-million dollar car, speeding to his depository bank, which he calls a temple.\n\nAnd people believe him.  They follow a wolf to his lair for as many reasons as there are people, but mostly, because he lures them with the love of Caesar's coin, that which he removes from their pockets.\n\nHe is the human embodiment of a wolf who spins tales for the love of money.",

My father was a Methodist minister before I was born. He also had a degree in mechanical engineering, and decided on an engineering career instead when my parents started a family. While he was a minister in Maryland, he and my mom were so poor, living in the parsonage with no heat. That, and other reasons I won't go into, was why he made the career change. He was never a Bible thumper, and was the kindest man I've ever known. \n\nGrowing up, my friends didn't know he was an ordained minister unless I told them. He had a falling out with the church when I was seven years old, and we never went back. Back then, I was afraid God would be mad at us for not going to church, and he simply said, \"You don't have to go to church to believe in God.\" He never preached to us or anyone else. He was simply a kind man. (I haven't been to church since we stopped going, and today I'm agnostic, leaning towards atheist.)\n\nThe best part about him being an ordained minister was having him perform my wedding ceremony - with just a few friends and immediate family, in my parents' living room. I cherish that memory.",

Also both of those things cost money in the form of compulsory donations if they're not outright charged for, in which case they still pester for donations.\n\nAlso if we don't recognize your marriage it means all that sex and living under one roof you're doing is a sin which means you're going to hell. Also forsaking god to have a godless marriage is a mortal sin so you're going to hell unless you fork over that $$$\n\nFuck you give us money",

In this closet was the most extravagant wardrobe I have ever seen. One side men's one side women's. All outfits and suits and shoes were the same size and it was obvious they were the collection of two people. This church was in a very poor area. When the \"pastor\" showed up with his wife, in a Benz and a fucking purple suit on with matching gators it made me sick. Thier only concern was the clothing and not the building. They wanted us to inventory all their clothes and lay them all out to dry. Fucker was a massive asshole and so was his wife. I told him my job is to assess the structural damage and his clothes were not my concern and told him he better do something about it because mould was starting to form. He started calling me and my helper fucking crackers and to get out of his church. Most disgusting thing I've seen in a long time, to take poor people's money and to buy now and later gators is beyond fucked up. Haven't thought of this in a while and I feel like people should pay more attention where your tithing goes",

All tax free because technically the church owned everything. They flew in private jets to special events.\n\nMind you 80% of the church members were considered poverty level.

Churches aren't required to disclose their financial records, but in the cases where they have, they're generally either turning a profit or grossly mismanaged. At the absolute least they should be required to disclose like other businesses.\n\n>You want to tax on usage....literally taxing a community of believers more...the more they do.\n\nYes. More usage means more wear on the roads, more use of emergency services, a greater load on sewer systems, etc. That's the same way businesses are taxed. Same for homeowners, too.\n\n>By this standard private schools and homeschoolers should be taxed higher.\n\nHigher than what? Homeschoolers already pay residential taxes, and private schools are taxed like businesses. Because they're businesses.\n\n>With this standard...no entity st all shouldn't be taxed...\n\nYeah, that would be horrible, right? Everyone paying their share and everyone accountable.\n\n>which brings me back to the original question..why? What good does it produce.\n\nYou mean... other than the infrastructure and services that I already described? Emergency services, sanitation, roads, admin, parks, schools, social programs? Not a lot beyond that. What else did you have in mind?\n\n>More money for politicians to waste...? Which one of them do you trust? They all some crooked to me.\n\nYet you're in favor of a business that sells a product which can't be confirmed to exist to vulnerable populations having zero oversight. And, of course, you don't actually understand how taxes work or what they pay for.",

You\u2019re going against God. You in your conscience are trying to shut God out. You are trying your hardest to reject Gods Lordship over you that you may be your own lord. The page for atheists is exactly created to oppose God. You don\u2019t see people creating pages to oppose the fairy godmother or the spaghetti monster as Richard Dawkins talks about equating the belief in God to that of belief in those things. No. You oppose God and Christ because deep down you know He exists. And you don\u2019t want anything to do with Him. Or to submit to His will. Never mind these prosperity false prophets and picking at them as though they represent God. Think about the true Jesus of the Bible that said repent for the Kingdom of God is at hand. The one that talked about hell more than anyone else in the Bible. Every knee will bow and every tongue shall confess that He is Lord on that day that is to come.",

Family is of God. One man and one woman, having children. The man is the bread winner in the family and provides for them. That\u2019s self sacrificing love that of Jesus. The laws that govern the land such as do not steal to not murder, or damage others property are in fact laws that are of God. You are living in Gods world and in the bounds of Gods law. Yet without believing in Him and having a personal relationship with Him. Charles Spurgeon quoted that morality may keep you out of prison. But it is the blood of Jesus that will keep you out of hell. Morality in and of its self doesn\u2019t make someone a good person. Because deep down inside all humans are corrupt. And by the workings of the law shall no man be justified before God. The law was given by God through Moses and the law shows that indeed no man can keep the whole law. But people fail to realize they are indeed wicked and sinners. But it\u2019s faith in Jesus that saves a person.",

Those that claim they were Christian\u2019s and have left the church and mock Jesus and God the Father. You know God exists. You\u2019re going against God. You in your conscience are trying to shut God out. You are trying your hardest to reject Gods Lordship over you that you may be your own lord. The page for atheists is exactly created to oppose God. You don\u2019t see people creating pages to oppose the fairy godmother or the spaghetti monster as Richard Dawkins talks about equating the belief in God to that of belief in those things. No. You oppose God and Christ because deep down you know He exists. And you don\u2019t want anything to do with Him. Or to submit to His will. Never mind these prosperity false prophets and picking at them as though they represent God. Think about the true Jesus of the Bible that said repent for the Kingdom of God is at hand. The one that talked about hell more than anyone else in the Bible. Every knee will bow and every tongue shall confess that He is Lord on that day that is to come.",
