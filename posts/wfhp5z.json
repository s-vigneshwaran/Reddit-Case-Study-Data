Eventually this \"VV\" ligature transformed into \"W\"... and its sound mutated again to be a /v/, while the sound of V was now somehow /f/. I'm still waiting for the year 2100 when germans decide that they'll read \"W\" as /f/ and they need a \"WW\" for /v/.",

Over time it morphed into something vaguely resembling the letter 'y' and as such many people misread it, thus 'thou' become 'you'.\n\nThis was reinforced when printing presses came with Latin/Germanic characters and (\u00fe) was transcribed from written into the 'y' it kind of looked like.\n\nMuch like 'Ye Olde Tavern', only the 'y' isn't a 'y' but a morphed (\u00fe). What it really says is not 'ye' but 'the'.",

There's no \"they\" in this yet. \"they\" was borrowed from the Vikings around 1200.\n\nThe others are definitely older but \"they\" made its singular debut shortly after it entered English. All the big writers used it in that way and it's in two important Bible translations. So there's literally no arguing about its validity.\n\nSorry, wall of text.",

I love them, but I still slip up.  To me, it's like asking me to write their name with my left hand instead of my right in the middle of a sentence.  It always feels awkward still, but I try.  In their presence it is easier, but only in the last few years have I been making an honest attempt to use their pronouns when speaking with others about them when not in their presence.  I find this particular sentence I just wrote to be a little harder to parse as a native speaker because the use of a distinguished pronoun can help resolve the ambiguity of the use of they and instead force a reliance on context that didn't used to be there (and yes of course the opposite is true, ambiguity exists when the second person and the third person have the same gender)\n\nWe are used to addressing third person singular as they when the gender is unknown or ambiguous, or in my case on random occasions because I study other languages and it's made the way I speak English change.\n\nI am used to relying on visual cues to infer the linguistic gender of the subject, but now I have to remember not only their name (ADHD, terrible with names in new situations) but also the pronouns they wish to be addressed by.  When my sibling (a word that feels as familiar as though I am referring to someone else's pet) is in a group of their friends that wish to be referred to by different pronouns, I end up instead trying to use their names instead because I can't keep it straight.\n\nI have considered myself to be lgbtq+ friendly and open minded and accepting of everyone, but when it comes to pronouns it's not a natural thing for me to change this and takes effort.  The use of they in place of a gendered pronoun, while has use in the English language, is uncommonly used to refer to a specific person all the time, and had been used instead at the discretion of the speaker.  It is now seen as wrong or harmful to use they vs a gendered pronoun at the speaker's discretion, and must now remember to use the appropriate pronoun of the third person as requested by them.  People are now shamed for not taking care to do this.\n\nTrivializing the difficulty of this recalibration serves to alienate those who are sympathetic and wish to do no harm.  Those who are derisive could be worthy of ire, but be careful to assume that this is easy for everyone to get right.  The added stigma of getting this wrong can feel like an attack that is unwarranted, and might cause some to become bitter as opposed to being motivated to get it right.  Some I'm sure are upset that they must do this correctly at all when (in their opinion) they've been doing nothing wrong up until this time, that using the wrong gender is simply an accident as opposed to potentially being seen as an aggression.\n\nThis is a frustrating time for all.",

Either a) they don't want to acknowledge the existence of other genders for whatever personal reason, or b) they don't want to have to remember another thing about acquaintances they barely know.\n\nAs someone who has a real hard time remembering a person's name unless I interact with them regularly, I can feel a little sympathy for B. Particularly if the person is being overly pushy with it, or wants to be addressed by uncommon pronouns like xe/xir. I am willing to try and remember someone's pronouns, but am aware I will probably fail unless I encounter that person enough.

Specially since schools are not teaching that, hell they don\u2019t even teach the non gendered pronouns in Spanish.\n\nI\u2019d rather people just use names but what the hell do I know.",

And despite all the instruction to the contrary, it was still in normal use for persons of unknown gender, strangers, theoretical persons, and even those whose gender was known and had already been referred to, just for a little spice. Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, our style manuals said, but those manuals said a ton of shit that no one adhered to in casual speech *or* professional writing. It's fine to run a test on, but people don't talk like that. Teachers and professors both would routinely slip up in speech and writing, violating the proscribed conventions, and rarely was it ever noticed or remarked on. The prescriptivists have been losing for longer than anyone still living has been alive.\n\nFind any published yahoo--and this could be blogs or some other history of online or newspaper/magazine writings, not necessarily *books*--or talking head who currently takes issue with the singular *they* and comb through history of writing and speech, and I assure you that you'll find them dropping *they* instead of *he* even for unknown or theoretical persons, without any particular need to, long before they bothered to get a stick up their ass about pronouns at all.

The rule in a lot of style manuals, even as late as the 1990s, was that any unknown person should be referred to as \"he\":\n\n>Remember that I'm leaving work early on Thursday to pick up my cousin from the airport.\n\n>>I didn't know you had any cousins. What's he in town for?\n\n>She's visiting for Thanksgiving.\n\nAnd we were definitely not all running around in the 90s, categorically using \"he\" to refer to any person of an unknown gender. The books can *say* a thing is proper, but *people speaking the language* have largely never cared about what any hoity-toity fucks wrote as authoritative in some book 50 years prior, no matter how much they may have been quizzed on it in school. We're all standing waist-deep in a mound of broken language \"rules\" whose supposed virtues were smacked into us by a ruler to the back of the hand--and a lot of those rules were *literally* nothing more than the personal thoughts of whatever fuckhead had the cash to get published yonks ago. Folks in the profession of teaching from books had to use the books that were around, right?\n\nBut yes, you're right, it's a little newer that you and I, referring to someone named Dave who we personally know (and who may have just left the room), would use \"they\" between ourselves to reference them. But that's not the specific line drawn by the anti-*they* types. *Those folks* aren't just taking issue with the *individual* they, but any singular form, known or unknown--despite despite their parents definitely having used it without issue for decades before their births. They're fucking chumps.",

If you are talking about two males, \"he\" is too vague and you have to use a name again.\n\n\"They\" suffers from the same problem, *and* can refer to a group of people so the *only* time you can use it (aside from as an ambiguous) is when you're referring to exactly one enby person, or by specifying who from the group you're talking about, which sort of defeats the point of using a pronoun as a shortcut.\n\nE.g. \"Are Alex and Sam coming to the movies?\" \"Alex says they can't go.\"\n\nAlex can't go?

The pronoun stands in for *Mary and Tom* they previously mentioned.\n\n>the whole point of third-person pronouns is so you don't have to keep saying the name of the person (or people) you're talking about.\n\nBut that's not the whole point. It's one aspect. Pronouns are more useful when you don't know someone's name or their gender.\n\nThe English language has been using 'they' for individuals and groups for centuries. It works just fine, and context is usually enough to make it clear what is meant. When that isn't the case, the language is plenty flexible to clear up any ambiguity.",

That problem would be solved by just referring to that child by their name.

I have absolutely had instances years and years ago where I had to talk about someone named \"Alex\" and didn't know if they were male or female so I just used \"they\" when referring to them. It wasn't a problem then and it isn't a problem now.",

Yes we all already use they/them all the time.

It is uncomfortable for a lot of people to use \"they\" in its singular form when referring to someone specific. It can feel like othering, or disrespectful. Using they/them pronouns for someone exclusively in all instances is new usage. Ignoring this difference, and getting frustrated with people who feel this discomfort and aren't aware of exactly why it is uncomfortable only encourages them to double down on their opinion. It does not do anyone any favours. It delays widespread acceptance of the new usage.\n\nEdit: added some words for clarity.",

I guess youre anti-immigrant too?  Your friends might have it easier because they all come from countries with *romantic* languages - poly-syllabic languages.\n\nComing from say, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, or in this instance, Vietnamese, which is a tonal mono-syllabic language, is a ***much*** harder transition.  Oh and they dont have a singular they in any of those languages - in fact, most of them dont support or subscribe to the trans notion either.  *Actually* my gfs cousin got stoned to death for being gay, so ya know, thats a thing.  If you wanna call people **transphobic** maybe you should aim that cannon somewhere else.\n\nBut obviously you wouldnt know that.  You dont seem to know a *lot* of things.",

More harm was done by the trans community than my family.  But you have a serious trauma in your life to talk like you do - I hope youre talking to a therapist about it.\n\n> I don't know what you mean by that, but I'm sure it's funny. \n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/topic/Romance-languages\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_languages\n\nI know youre knee deep in trans ideology, but you couldnt take 2 seconds to google the phrase?  Well, Dutch, German, Sweedish are definitely romance languages, but since you didnt mention Arabic or Urdu, we can address those as different for sure.\n\n> I don't know why a language being tonal or monosyballic would make learning one small extra step in English a total impossibility.\n\nObviously, because youre effectively tone deaf to anyone having to *learn* english from an incredibly vastly different language and context.  Do you realize most of Europes languages came from Latin now that youve educated yourself with my links?  Now that you know that, lets talk about mono vs poly syllabic languages.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monosyllabic_language\n\nhttps://www.languagehumanities.org/what-is-a-monosyllabic-language.htm\n\nSo, now that youve *further* educated yourself, maybe you can understand that a mono-syllabic language think differently, as tone and inflection play a much larger role than the word itself.  Words can change meaning by their tone, vs an entirely different word.   When your brain learns in tones vs words, and then youre having to be *taught* that poly-syllabic words can be [homonyms](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/homonym), that fucks with you.  There, their and they're.  All sound the same, but are different words entirely.  My gf has an incredibly strong grasp of the english language, but there are a multitude of instances where she is often confused, or frustrated, because some asshole decided to be \u2728*fucking special*\u2728.  So that *one extra step* youre talking about, is used about **fucking never**, as the *majority* of trans people, still prefer a gendered pronoun - like he/his or she/shis. Only the fucking weirdos and oddballs (are you one of those?\ud83e\udd14) challenge language at its core and force people to use things like xe/xer and they/them.  Yes, your pathetic attempt at uniqueness has frustrated someone who doesnt understand rare broken english only used by a fraction of a fraction of people.  Congratulations.  Sickening.\n\nNow, all that put together, learning the word 'they' and using it in sentences, it is, ***more often than not***, referring to a plural group.  So this is learned along side of your natural language and proceeds to be a part of the language center of your brain.  Those signals can mix up too.  Then some asshole comes along and 'corrects' your speech, because they are **triggered** that you ***DARED*** to call them by a gender.  *\"Excuse you!  My preferred pronouns are they/them!\"*.  Wait, she says, I was always taught that they/them is a group, is this not correct?  Well, in **THIS ONE MINOR RANDOM INSTANCE** its an asshole who cant realize that gendered pronouns exist in the world to just make language *easier* to identify things/people.  Were you aware that there are a multitude of *gendered languages* out there?\n\nhttps://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20201006-are-some-languages-more-sexist-than-others\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_gender#The_manifestation_of_grammatical_gender\n\nYou should read up on *why* those languages use gendered nouns and pronouns to identify things/people.  And why its important to retain those distinctions.\n\nBut honestly? Truly?  I expect you to shit out some garbage ass reply, not read a single thing that Ive typed here, and maintain your ignorant, disgusting, victimized and overall dictatorial world view and just label me a *transphobe* because you dont like it.\n\nIm not even mad at you.

      "text": "Many comments I read so far assume that the person makes an aggressive statement by saying that one should use the name or the pronoun he/she, it could simply be that they did not know that they is possible to be used in this way. \n\n/u/ill_monstro_g pointed out that the use of singular they dates back to 1325 but the article (https://public.oed.com/blog/a-brief-history-of-singular-they/) also seems to explain that some dictionaries only list it since 2010 with a remark that it is widely accepted. Consequently, any foreigner also likely never learned about it in high school prior to ten years ago - and I cannot tell whether it is taught at this point. Likely not, as school books can take a long time to be adapted. Hence, the above example might actually be without ill intent.\n\nFurther, even if useful - I actually do think singular they seems very useful - as a non- native speaker, it is not always clear to me how I should use singular they in a non-written conversation.\nFor example, consider the scenario that you are at a party and met \"Peter\". You believe they might be male but the topic was not discussed yet. Another person joins and you quickly want to introduce them to each other. \nWould you now say: \"This is Peter, they is a lawyer.\"? or \"This is Peter, he is a lawyer. \"?\n\nIf one is of the opinion, that when the person is \"obviously\" male, we say \"he\", we are assuming a gender, which we probably should not, if there is a construction that allows us to prevent it. So, let's say you use \"they\", instead. Could it offend Peter? Maybe Peter wants to be male but he is in transition and it now is made obvious to him that in your eyes, Peter's gender might not be \"fully\" male, which can be hurting. \n\nFinally, one could always ask what gender to use but it (currently?) seems like a strange question to regularly start a conversation with. This is probably also the reason why some events now use name tags with color codes to indicate the preferred pronoun in order to avoid having to bring up the topic. \n\nI really don't mean to offend anyone but would actually like to know how to address such situations correctly. Maybe it can also help others to adopt the right use in the future.",

It's just a matter of taste with respect to how willing you are to assume someone's gender. I assume people's gender all the time, if I run afoul I apologize and correct myself in the future. It's really not that hard. :)",

Fuck, identify as a fucking duck for all I care, just don't try and force others to validate it or get offended when someone calls you by the wrong pronoun, if you feel that way that's really all that should matter. I, a male, have very long hair and I wear skinny jeans often so naturally every once in a while I'm mistaken for a lady from behind, never once has this offended me. I know what I am, what I feel, and a Freudian slip from someone else will not change that \n\nTo the others, stop being offended by the fact people are not fitting your \"normal\" view of the world. Use your words let them use theirs. I personally do not agree with it, but I respect others minds enough to let them be who they are and not treat them less for wanting to be called by something else\n\nP.S. Dibs on being Batman",

      "text": "Ok, I'm gonna be that guy.  If someone's personal pronouns are they/them, then it is grammatically acceptable to use in a sentence.  However, if you are talking about a person and you don't know what pronoun to use, then you *should not* use they or them because they are plural pronouns, and they don't match the singular antecedent.  While most people still use they and them as a singular pronoun all the time (including me), it still isn't grammatically correct.  Most of the time, the way that you would address the person would be by either using \"him/her\" or by avoiding pronouns all together.\n\nEdit: Took me a bit, but I was able to get a copy of the APA manual.  Here's what it says on singular \"they\":\n\n> Writers should always use singular \"they\" to refer to a person who uses \"they\" as their pronoun (see Section 5.5 for more on gender and pronoun usage).  Also, use \"they\" as a generic third-person singular pronoun to refer to a person whose gender is unknown or irrelevant to the context of the usage.  Although usage of singular \"they\" was once discouraged in academic writing, many advocacy groups and publishers have accepted and endorsed it, including *Merriam-Webster's Dictionary* (Merriam-Webster, n.d.-b).  The use of the singular \"they\" is inclusive of all people, helps writers avoid making assumptions about gender, and is part of APA style.\n\nTLDR: I was wrong.",
