  "text": "Pro-lifers don't care about your arguments.\nI'm seeing a lot of arguments being made against an abortion ban as if the forced birth, Bible-thumper crowd give a singular shit about logic:\n\nAbortion access reduces abortion.\n\n*THEY DON'T CARE.*\n\nThe Bible only gives instructions on how to perform an abortion.\n\n*THEY DON'T CARE.*\n\nEctopic pregnancies can't be saved.\n\n*THEY DON'T CARE.*\n\nIt's hypocritical to care about the unborn and abandon them as soon as they're born due to lack of funding for financial assistance programs.\n\n*THEY DON'T CARE*\n\nThird trimester abortions are rare and almost always for medical reasons.\n\n*THEY DON'T CARE.*\n\nJesus never mentioned abortions.\n\n*THEY DON'T CARE.*\n\nYou don't even read your own Bible.\n\n*THEY DON'T CARE*\n\nThis will kill more women.\n\n*THEY DON'T CARE.*\n\nThis will force children into poverty, into families that don't want them.\n\n# They. Don't. FUCKING. CARE.\n\nThis is has never been about logic. This has never been about debate. It's about control by whatever means necessary. While well-meaning people voice their arguments against the hell we're seeing unfold, these zealots continue to embolden themselves and position themselves to strike just like they have been for decades leading up to this moment.\n\nI don't have a good solution at this point other than burning shit down in a rage. I feel like playing nice and trying to be civil is what has led us to our current situation. I'm not sure any recourse will work at this point other than beating these people into submission and into the shadows. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe we can fix this some other way, but I'm losing hope.\n\nThanks for hearing me out.",

Those are not inconsistent beliefs\n\nPersonally, I sincerely doubt anyone would endure months of a pregnancy without being certain they want the baby, or that a doctor would abort a baby that is would survive outside the womb and not just induce birth. But it can take time to meet the legal requirements for abortions for medical reasons which could put the mother further at risk, so I'm happy to leave abortion open without restrictions\n\nThat's not inconsistent with believing the baby is a person",

Abortion is a medical decision and healthcare. It needs to be reframed as such.",

The fuck. Out.\n\nIf a Jewish law were enacted that outlawed and shut down Red Lobster nationwide, the Christians would lose their shit.\n\nAnd they would be correct in being upset and resisting. They just can't make that next step in thought to \"maybe, if we just followed our own rules and didn't try to force others to adhere to our rules too, we'd get left alone\". They are physically incapable of seeing something from the other side of the viewpoint.\n\nI think it comes from the Evangelical mindset of faith being more important than works. That simply asking for forgiveness of their sins is enough to achieve salvation. They don't have to actually walk and behave like Jesus, what with the empathy and compassion he actually puts forth in the Gospels. They just have to have faith. And that's good enough. But they've taken it a step further and have likened taking total control of society, and forcing everyone to follow their rules they made up, to the only acceptable form of worldly works to go alongside faith. Anything that would actually benefit society as a whole is awful and sinful, unless they have total control of it.\n\nThe Moral Majority in the early 1970s launched a soft/cold crusade, and over the last 50 years they're slowly turning the temperature up on it. They can't possibly accept that the individuals they view as undesirables might be given the same agency, freedoms, and privileges they have benefitted from.\n\nI genuinely believe that we are on the cusp of a theocratic turn in this country, completely counter to the Enlightenment period philosophies that informed and gave birth to our country.",

Bringing a child into the world when you don't want one harms the well-being of the parent as well as the well-being of the child they raise. Bringing a child into the world when you can't afford it harms well-being of everyone involved. We need **less** of that kind of strife in the world, and the only two ways to guarantee you never have a child are a hysterectomy or an abortion. In most cases, the latter is likely a better solution unless the woman absolutely never wants a child.\n\nWe can absolutely cut down on the number of abortions with robust sex education and birth control. But the forced birth crowd will **never** be correct.",

They literally believe that babies are being murdered every day. \n\nDO they believe that, though?\n\nIf you look close, you'll realize that \"a zygote is literally the same as a baby!\" is a semantic hack to make their propaganda sound better, not an actual belief about reality.\n\nIf I were in a burning building, and I had the opportunity to either save one random five-year-old from the fire, or to save twenty random five-year-olds, the obvious answer would be to save twenty.\n\nHowever, if I had to choose between saving one random five-year-old, and saving a petri dish full of twenty theoretically viable eight-cell embryos, I would choose the single *actual* child, without hesitation, every single time. \n\nGo ahead and pose this hypothetical situation to any \"pro-life\" advocate. They might fret for a while before admitting that they would save the child, or they might immediately start screaming obscenities in your face. But almost nobody would look you in the eye and say \"Yes, I would let the five year old child die to save the petri dish\".\n\nBut that's not the most damning aspect of this lie. Because you see, of all fertilized zygotes, about half fail to implant in the uterine wall, and another 30-60% spontaneously abort in the first trimester, often before the mother realizes she's pregnant. These numbers were even higher before the advent of modern medicine. If there is a god, he is by far the most prolific abortionist in all of history.\n\nIf you're of the opinion that \"life begins at conception\", this means that spontaneous miscarriage is a humanitarian crisis greater than Cancer, greater than AIDS, greater than Malaria, greater than the Black Death, greater than **literally every other cause of death put together**. And yet how often do you hear \"pro-life\" groups supporting medical research as even a *secondary* priority compared to [harassing and punishing women who have sex](http://amptoons.com/blog/?p=13565)?\n\nWhenever a Republican votes to make it more difficult to access contraceptives, or to teach misinformation to children about how their reproductive systems work, or to \"defund Planned Parenthood!\", that politician [is actively working to make **more** dead fetuses](http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2015/01/why-right-wing-christian-cultists-like-the-duggars-kill-the-most-embryos/). (And more dead children, and more dead adults, but we already know that they don't care about *those*).",

Teach someone from a young age that abortion is the great evil that must be banned at all costs and they will support you no matter what else you do as long as you promise them you will put an end to abortions, and tell them that you and your cohorts are the only ones who can be trusted to fight against abortion at all costs.\n\nOf course, there are those people whose stance is more malleable and who could still be convinced that abortion solves more problems than it supposedly causes, but for the most part, you're completely correct that those who keep voting in favour of horrible leaders who have nothing to their name other than a promise to ban abortions don't care about any arguments the rest of the population brings forth for why the legality of abortions is good.",

      "text": "A christian who is genuinely convinced that abortion is murder cannot be convinced, for what should be totally understandable reasons to us. They will deny the Bible\u2019s verses on abortion and say we have misinterpreted them. They will be against iuds, birth control pills, and morning after pills because someone convinced them that those things abort a zygote. They will buy the \u2018beating heart\u2019 argument because it\u2019s tailor made to appeal to emotion (in this case I give them a video of a few heart cells alone in a Petri dish to show beating is ingrained, just to sow doubt.)\n\nThey don\u2019t want malformed fetuses aborted because god just wants us to love that child, even if they die in agony in minutes to days, and it will be made up for by an eternity of paradise. What\u2019s a lifetime of suffering compared to eternity? Mother Theresa (that hypocritical bitch) taught catholics that suffering is beautiful.\n\nThey see the woman\u2019s life and the fetus\u2019 as equal in god\u2019s eyes so it\u2019s up to god\u2019s will to decide which survives.\n\nThey focus only on the unborn because their politicians have sold them on the idea that \u2018lazy\u2019 people don\u2019t deserve healthcare. They claim that churches care for these people because they never sit down and study what various churches actually do for the poor, etc. Admittedly, some churches feed the poor, etc, but they are an anomaly.\n\nThey want every Planned Parenthood shut down, even if they only provide non-abortion services, because PP is evil. If PP provides abortion services not funded by the government (cause it isn\u2019t) they are convinced that \u2018money is fungible\u2019 so the money technically *does* go to abortions.\nSo we know it\u2019s all bullshit but all we can do is sow doubt, because *they have been convinced abortion is murder.*\n\nI hate these people for obvious reasons. But I also very marginally respect the extremists because they are totally true to the \u2018all abortions are murder\u2019 argument. Those who excuse abortions for say, rape victims, are saying murder is okay in some cases, so I see them as bigger hypocrites.\n\nAnd I hate all of them.\n\nEdit to fix autocorrect",

From now on, Americans who want to own a firearm must join a militia, where they will go and drill every other weekend.  They will all be registered with the state as civilian reserve soldiers, their firearms will be maintained in their local militia armory under the strictest control protocol, administered by licensed armorers, and will only be issued to them for militia exercises or state-approved hunting excursions (during which they must be accompanied by a game warden at all times).  While the firearm is in their custody it is illegal to consume alcohol.\n\nNow, if states are going to be allowed to completely outlaw abortion, they can use the same logic used in the SCOTUS draft to institute these restrictions on gun ownership.",

I mean, that's cool and all but it doesn't make murdering people ok. \n\nThe bible gives instructions on how to murder people. Uhhh, so what? Murder is still wrong. \n\nTerminally ill homeless can't be saved. So, we're just going to euthanize them without their consent? That's pretty fucked up.\n\nIt's hypocritical to care about stopping homeless murder and not care about providing the resources to house them. Look. Reasonable minds can differ on the best way to tackle homelessness. But the idea that I need to agree to house homeless people in my basement or think my tax dollars should be used to build them permanent houses in order to think it is wrong to murder them is simply fucked up.\n\nMurder of elderly homeless is rare and almost always done for medical reasons. Like, what? Just because a homeless person has Alzheimer's doesn't make murdering them ok. \n\nJesus never mentioned homeless murder. So what? Thou shall not kill. Not that fucking hard to extrapolate to the homeless. \n\nYou don't even read your own Bible. So what? How does me not reading my own Bible make murder ok??\n\nThey will kill more women. There are other ways to address that that aren't murder. \n\nThey will force others into poverty and be a drain on those who don't want them around. And? None of that makes murder ok. \n\nSee? See how dumb these are? This is exactly how fucking stupid you sound to a pro-lifer. Let's stop wasting our breath and words on idiocy. All that matters is women are people and we don't make people use their bodies to keep others alive. Hell, organ donation is still optional because we can't get people to agree that *dead* bodies must be used for the benefit of others. These women are still alive and using their bodies, thank you very much. That's it.

You really want to have to explain your position on something that personal and likely traumatic and wait for a decision telling you what you\u2019re permitted to do? Wouldn\u2019t the person in the situation be the best one to know their own circumstances and decide for themselves?  Do you really think anyone WANTS to have an abortion? I get that maybe they don\u2019t want their money to go towards funding abortions through planned parenthood etc, but how can you not see that letting the government into your wallet is the far lesser evil than inviting the government into your life if that\u2019s your general position?",

The reason why they can fake crocodile tears and cry about babies is because they've been consistent with that tactic for years and its seeped into the public consciousness.  The only way to fight that is to have an equally rabid and passionate objection to them.  If they yell and scream, we yell at scream.  They've held vigils in front of the SCOUTS every year on the anniversary of RvW, then if they overturn it, we must do the same thing on the anniversary of that date.  \n\nIts also important to make sane arguments for those who listen on the sidelines and are not entirely decided yet.  Yes, people who don't care that much still exist, and its to them that these arguments are directed.  With equal fervor as the forced birther rabble, we must be equally vehement in stating our case.  Argue on reddit, argue with friends and relatives, attend public protests, etc.  \n\nOne thing the forced birth side does NOT do is just give up because they can't convince other people with their rhetoric.  That kind of evil must be met with the same energy.  I've donated to Planned Parenthood in the past, I think its time to drop another donation to keep up the fight.",

If someone had told me a year ago the US could turn into something like the handmaiden's tale dystopia I would have just laughed, but now I know anything is possible. Consider this: what if a liberal SCOTUS ruled that individual gun ownership was not a right, with the result being half the states totally forbade guns while the other half said you could have only SOME kinds of firearms?  All the justices who voted for it with have to go into hiding and the federal government could well be overthrown.  The situation with abortion is analogous not that.  The Right wouldn't tolerate having their guns taken nor should we allow those lying bastards on this court to take away our constitutional rights either.",

A fertilized egg will eventually grow into a person after about 9 months, but even if they prove out their case and successfully draw the line at conception (they won't without some vague Bible verses), it misses an obvious point:  who's life is more important, a fully grown human or a potential person growing inside that human?  If you give a fetus the same rights as the rest of us then a miscarriage would legally be considered manslaughter, which would be asinine, given that miscarriages happen all the time through no fault of the mother.",

It\u2019s a human rights issue.

I'm certainly not religious but I believe abortion is unethical in 99% of cases.  I'm all for contraceptives and sex ed.  I know they're still not readily available to all but I find it unconscionable to terminate the life of an innocent human.  I believe life is a right and sex free of consequences is not.  That's really all there is to it, certain religions just like to use this issue to disguise their racist and misogynistic agendas.",
