She was in full denial to have done anything wrong during that period. Being a party member and working as a nurse was \"mandatory\" but had nothing to do with anything. No self-reflection AT ALL. To be fair, the part of the country where they lived was and is very rural, but even in that region synagogues burned to the ground.\n\nIts a shamefull mindset to not face your own past and go on full denial instead of teaching your kids to do better.",

They knew what he was and STILL voted for him twice. \n\nThat\u2019s true but we saw those numbers drop significantly last year and Trump lost while other Republicans one. This is a scary scenario for the GOP because it shows their mental stranglehold on their voters isn\u2019t as strong as they thought. It shows that they won\u2019t always vote red. \n\n\n> This isn't a messaging issue. White people like \"sheets\" or covers that they can hide their racism behind and feign ignorance. CRT is just the newest cover.\n\nDefinitely. Dog whistles have been used forever to try and \u201chide\u201d racism. CRT is just the newest and loudest dog whistle. \n\n> Many will argue for hours that they never thought Trump  was racist, while deep down they know that's exactly why they voted for him. Studies have shown this. Until sane white people accept the fact that MOST white people WANT to oppress others, the problem will only grow. The white vs white/others civil war is coming.\n\nI don\u2019t believe a civil war is imminent. Not because the makings of one aren\u2019t there. Our country is a powder keg and theirs book of matches 3 feet away.  But mainly because of the people in our country, our military and the fact that we don\u2019t have defined borders like we did previously. \n\nI think we will see acts of domestic terrorism committed by white peoples sky rocketing. I\u2019m terrified of that. I live in a blue city surrounded by red and there have already been issues. \n\n> Until sane white people accept the fact that MOST white people WANT to oppress others, the problem will only grow.\n\nFor the sake of honesty and clarity, I\u2019m  white af. Like, John Mulaney white but without the addiction. I grew up in a racist household, in racist towns and among racist people. I knew slurs that most people didn\u2019t before middle school. I didn\u2019t fall into that because I was exposed to non-racist communities online and found the truth. \n\nThis is why I don\u2019t agree that the majority of them  want to oppress people. They\u2019re ignorant and fearful and politicians fight to make sure that doesn\u2019t change. It\u2019s why they\u2019re against better education programs and free college. Knowledge helps kill that fear.  \n\nPoliticians play up that fear knowing it\u2019ll drive people to the polls. They use things like CRT to convince ignorant white people that their fake enemy is going to try and oppress anyone them. I heard numerous conversations growing up about how POC weren\u2019t fighting for equality. They were fighting for superiority. \n\nThat\u2019s not true but media tells them it is. That\u2019s why they believe that Black Lives Matter means ONLY Black Lives Matter. It\u2019s why they love to say stupid shit like \u201cI believe everyone should be equal. No one deserves special privileges just because of their skin color\u201d\n\nFor most people, if they could snap their fingers and everything would be equal and perfect for everyone then they would snap their fingers like Thanos.\n\nNow, this isn\u2019t all to say there isn\u2019t a huge chunk of the white American population that would love to return to the old days where there was no question of who or who wasn\u2019t at risk of being oppressed. They have been fed bullshit their entire lives by friends, family and Fox. \n\nThose people exist and they like to be heard. Unfortunately. \n\nBut the others, which I feel make up the majority, are just stupid and afraid. That\u2019s why the GOP focuses on non-college educated poor people.  They know that they can convince them that \u201cscary POC want to take over and make you their slave and teach your children you\u2019re evil\u201d and they\u2019ll believe it and vote. They believe them when they say that they too can become rich but it\u2019s POC that are keeping them from that.\n\nBesides doing the things that are needed to make things truly equal, such as criminal justice reform, tax reform, reparations, and, you know, essentially recreating our entire racist ass legal system, we also need to invest heavily in education. \n\nIf we could get free pre-k and free college, we could have a huge effect on the number of racists in this country. There would still be a lot, of course, but it would drop significantly. \n\nOh, and yeah. I agree. The majority of white people are dense as fuck and don\u2019t realize that there is a population of people who don\u2019t want equality.",

It only drives to create unnecessary distinctions in the child's mind, and could produce the opposite intended effect. Instead we should strengthen the other parts of their education so they can have a greater understanding of abstract concepts. Then when we do introduce them to things like privilege, they aren't immediately going home saying \"well Dad, Mrs Simmons says Timmy's life is better than mine cause he's white/cis/het/etc. Why can't I be XYZ like Timmy!?!\" Or \"Mom, are we bad people? Teacher says our family went out and killed Sarah's great-great-grandparents for land/religion.\"\n\n\nHowever, things like Segregation, the Tulsa Massacre, the Chinese Exclusionary Act, Trail of Tears, etc etc should absolutely remain a facet of American history classes. We are a nation of exiled immigrants on stolen land, and that legacy should be a grave reminder for our citizenry to always act with wisdom, rather than courage or strength. Acting rashly out of fear has never benefitted the men and women of America, and will continue to harm us unless we find a way to unite.\n\nI understand the concern of a parent, however if parents cannot re-examine their own motives and self-reflect on the possibility they may be racist, then they might be racist. I don't think every opponent to CRT is racist, just that a lot of fearmongering occurs and people lash out over things they aren't being told the whole story about.",

To engender the youth with a productive outlook that will further the interests of the state?
