Then her base (social democrats and leftists, not liberals) tore the libs a new asshole for falling for Fox News' BS.\n\nBut the party establishment went along with it because they generally hate the party's small social-democratic bloc...mostly because their interests run counter to the Democratic party's corporate donors who fund a large portion of the party's election campaigns.\n\nAlmost all of her actual supporters 100% agree with her, including Bernie Sanders (who was one of AOC's mentors) - aka the first major Jewish presidential candidate in American history.\n\nActual anti-Semites often really like Israel, which makes sense if you think about it: racists are always telling black people to \"go back to Africa,\" and Israel provides the Jewish equivalent of that. If you don't want Jewish people in your country, you're going to like a place that provides all of them automatic citizenship and tries to incentivize them to move there.\n\nIt's also effectively an American puppet state in the Middle East, which means it serves American imperialism, and racists (including anti-Semites) tend to support that.\n\nEdit: Also:\n\n>dragged through the mud for criticizing the other 2\n\nThe entire left strongly backs Rojava in Syria and applauds them for crushing ISIS, and the \"Marxist\" left tends to either partially support or express indifference towards China's heavy-handed (although less so than America's) approach to Islamic terrorism in Xinjiang...so I don't think this is true. You'll also get torn a new asshole for supporting Israel, ISIS, or Al-Qaeda.\n\nAnd IME actual liberals in the wild (i.e. non-politicians) tend to be mostly indifferent about these things, since most of them focus almost exclusively on domestic social issues (e.g. trans rights, abortion, minimum wage).",

                  "text": "Jesunauts follow the original, uninterpreted lessons of Jesus of Nazareth as they pertain to the struggles of sentient beings on and beyond Earth.\n\nJesunauts recognize the literal truth that the kingdom of God is not of this world, and follow his ascension to heaven in mind, spirit, and as possible- body. Each Jesunaut seeks to contribute their lives and work to the physical and spiritual ascension of humankind.\n\nJesunauts practice, teach, and advocate the duty of radical compassion, humanitarianism, and self-sacrifice. God\u2019s gifts of intelligence and empathy are to be used as tools to analyze and minimize causes of unnecessary, involuntary suffering. Jesunauts hold humans responsible for defining and challenging their own morality by its rational benefit to humans and humanity.\n\nJesunauts are wary of the inevitability of human weakness. Jesunauts do not judge humans for their moral failures, but rather seek to create and encourage circumstances that allow human beings to live and coexist in the universe peacefully and sustainably.\n\nJesunauts commit to stewardship of the Earth. The Earth and every living creature are God\u2019s gifts to humankind. These blessings are ours to honor and cherish as examples of God\u2019s perfect creation. Jesunauts preserve and study the perfection of nature as the living word of God.\n\nJesunauts minister by studying and teaching God\u2019s creation as God has presented it. God\u2019s creation itself is his word and no human word is to be given precedence over what God shows us in nature. God\u2019s will cannot be translated into human language. Creation itself is the only language rich enough to convey God\u2019s will. Any human who tries to condense God\u2019s will into specific human action authorized by God is fundamentally mistaken.\n\nJesunauts dedicate themselves to the provision of healing arts for all humanity. Jesus healed through direct divinity to show primitive human cultures that healing is possible through God\u2019s power. Humans are guided to God\u2019s power by the diligent study of His creation. Jesus\u2019 examples of healing were a clear mandate for human beings to use God\u2019s gift of reason to understand, share, and diligently support all knowledge and practice of healing.\n\nJesunauts share communion with Jesus and one another through model aircraft and rocketry. Building and launching gravity defying machines is necessary to experience the truth of God\u2019s gifts and laws, and represents Jesus\u2019 diligent work on Earth and final ascension through God\u2019s grace.\n\nJesunauts are unconcerned with the state of an individual consciousness beyond a mortal existence. God has given human beings mortal life and anything beyond mortal life is exclusively God\u2019s domain. Jesunauts glorify God with efforts to extend, preserve, and enhance mortal life. God\u2019s perfection and the perfection of his gifts of life necessarily imply that whatever lies beyond mortal life will also be perfect.\n\nJesunauts mourn the tragedy of Jesus\u2019 torture and execution on Earth and do not make or possess monuments or relics symbolizing the brutality done to Jesus. Jesunauts celebrate Jesus\u2019 life and message of peace, compassion, ascension.\n\nJesunauts party with any other \u2018naut or non \u2018naut that share the above sentiments.\n\nA Jesunaut does not identify with any belief system and only follows their own personally validated beliefs. A Jesunaut makes no claim to represent any system of belief. A Jesunaut does claim to be a Jesunaut. There are no Jesunauts. There are just people who have heard about Jesunauts and share their sentiment and generally act like they think a Jesunaut would.",

Conservatives also seem to enable, and protect pedophiles and rapists, much like... that's right, the catholic church.

In fact, many priests historically joined the Church *because* of their homosexuality. The Church took the position that homosexuality is not a sin. Having homosexual sex is a sin (according to them, note that I'm not a Christian and I'm bi) but simply being attracted to the same sex is not.\n\nAs for how they treat those who abuse children (\"pedophile\" is the term that gets thrown around, but is inaccurate for several reasons) this has historically varied based on the person's role. But as far as priests go, the rules have changed radically circa the past 10-20 years.\n\nSo when you talk about how, \"the Catholic Church treats,\" various groups, you have to be careful about your tenses. The Church, today, has a global rule that all Church and Church-related organizations must follow: report crimes to authorities, cooperate with authorities fully, open records to authorities. One of the reasons that you've seen so many reports of decades of shielding perpetrators is that the Church has been sharing all of their old records on reported offenses and the resulting actions taken, going back many decades, sometimes centuries.\n\nI don't forgive the Church for its behavior in this, but I also don't act as if they haven't addressed the core issue (their willingness to protect offenders). From here, they get to demonstrate what kind of organization they want to be going forward. Maybe that will be the Church Francis wants us to see. Maybe it will be the one that the previous Pope was happy to preside over. I don't know. But if they do go the former route, I won't  just ignore that.",

This is unfortunate, as I thought we were having a rational discussion about the facts.\n\nWhat particular research would you like to see? Facts supporting each statement I made can be readily gathered, but there's a lot of it. I'm no fan of the Catholic Church... FAR FROM IT! But I will always defend the truth, even if it doesn't line up with my personal feelings. I would hope you would feel the same.\n\nFor the misuse of \"pedophile,\" for colloquial info you can just look to any abuse prevention organization's website. They'll set you on the path to find more academic sources, or you can search Google Scholar for details on the causes of sexual assault. The two primary angles I've covered in a parallel comment, but in short they rely on the definition of the word (which applies only to pre-pubescent attraction) and on the causes of sexual assault which are presumed by many to relate directly to attraction, but in actuality rarely do. This is criminal sexual abuse info you can find on just about any sexual abuse prevention site (e.g. [this one](https://www.thinkuknow.co.uk/parents/articles/why-do-people-sexually-abuse-children/) that clarifies the range of causes for child sexual abuse). Generally, abuse prevention organizations and academics don't use the word \"pedophile\" in any contexts outside of narrow clinical definitions and analysis of cultural trends, for this specific reason. It also further dehumanizes those who do not abuse anyone, but have specific, clinical diagnoses.\n\nFor the changes in Church policy... again, I'm not a Christian and therefore not a Catholic, but I can say that the Pope has been quite vociferous on this since his installation to that office, so you can just go look at the mandates and rules he's set out in his term. The popular press has also reported widely on this. There are also two major cases with the first in Chicago involving third-party orphanages and other such groups where recent (last 10 years) cases resulted in turning over records going back decades, which in turn illuminated the (almost entirely past the statute of limitations) decades-long history back to the 1950s of abuse on the parts of some 500 (from memory) or so clergy, Church employees and employees of Church-funded organizations. So yeah, let me know what you want and I can look it up for you, or you can just google \"Catholic sex abuse Chicago\" and look specifically at stories from the past 5 years or so. The other case I know of was in Pennsylvania, and matched roughly the  same parameters. Widescale abuse over many decades by clergy and employees of the Church was not revealed to police until *after* Francis's new rules and subsequent cases necessitated opening Church records.\n\nAs for the Church's rules on homosexuality, that's in the Catechism of the Catholic Church, which I've had to read up on for unrelated research. But let's look to a source that I think we can both agree isn't biased in favor of the Church for analysis:\n\n>> The fact that Catholicism does not consider the \u201cinclination\u201d sinful is very different from more fundamentalist Christian churches. It is one of the reasons that the Catholic Church has not officially approved of reparative therapy. The Catechism further states that \u201cHomosexual persons are called to chastity.\u201d However, the doctrine also specifies that, \u201cSuch persons must be accepted with respect and sensitivity. Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided.\u201d\n\n\\- https://www.hrc.org/resources/stances-of-faiths-on-lgbt-issues-roman-catholic-church\n\nSo yeah, I'm basically just repeating what the Human Rights Campaign sees in the same Catholic sources. This doesn't mean the Church has what we would call a \"progressive\" attitude on homosexuality, but there are a lot of people in this post's comments saying that the Catholic Church hates homosexuals, and that's (per the above) not a very accurate way to depict the situation.\n\nAre there extremely homophobic, even violently so Catholics out there who feel and behave as if being gay in the first place is not only sinful but sub-human? Almost certainly! But the stance of their Church is that they are wrong and not behaving according to their faith. So when talking about the Church as a whole, we should either refer to polls of the laity or the the official position of the Church, just as we would when referring to a faith that was much less in favor of treating homosexuals as human beings.",

The two most obvious ways in which this is inaccurate are that a) most sexual assaults against minors (including those perpetrated by clergy) were not against pre-pubescent individuals, but against post-pubescent minors. There is no specific diagnostic label for such sexual assault like there is for pre-pubescents. Essentially being attracted to someone who is post-pubescent falls into the psychological spectrum of normal attraction, but when that person is a minor, it is legally and (according to our culture's mores) morally unacceptable to act on such. And b) the assumption of sexual attraction turns out to be largely inaccurate. Studies of sexual assaults against minors have shown that the majority of such assaults are not motivated by a sexual attraction but by other factors ranging from dominance to replacing damaged or absent parental bonds.\n\nNote: I'm a victim of sexual assault as a minor. I understand some (though not all) of the factors that went into my own assault and can confirm that it's more complicated and messy than most of us like to admit. Nice neat boxes like \"pedophile\" make us feel good about being \"normal\" people, but these lines are frustratingly blurry and people who seem to check all the \"normal\" boxes can often turn out to be dangerous.",

During that time there were two major waves of smallpox, two major flu epidemics (including the 1918 pandemic) and several other serious disease outbreaks that would have impacted the school. The number of graves is often cited as evidence that kids were being killed and disposed of, but this doesn't quite fit with the evidence.\n\nMore likely native children were being buried unceremoniously if they died. A thousand or so over that period would not be unexpected (it would be today, but child mortality is radically lower across the board, today than it was from the 19th century to around WWII).",

Murder happening to an outsider is harmless to the tribe, so is clearly morally fine. Everything in the bible should be understood in the context of how it will be used by the society that wrote/interpreted it. For anything in it, the question is \"What effect will this have on society?\". Homosexuality might mean fewer children - that's no good, so it must be outlawed. Slavery though is free labour, which is useful, and women are more like property than people so rape is only harmful if it reduces the trade value of the woman. \n\nThe logical conclusion of Christianity is regressing to this kind of society, a feudal state where most people are property and everyone who isn't your ally is to be exterminated or enslaved. On the plus side though, the Amish were kind of onto something.",

All religion really is at the end of the day is people outsourcing the justification for their beliefs to something they perceive as an objective authority - ie, god. If they read their holy text at all, they're going to be looking for bits that hint that their god agrees with their opinions. While it's funny to see them avoid the inconvenient bits of the text, the real point that needs to be addressed when engaging this approach is how ridiculous it is to appeal to god to justify any opinion, not whether the book they use to prove god agrees with them actually shows god agrees with them, cos they're going to think god does either way. \n\nBasically, what's important is what people believe, not what the book they pretend is the word of god says they should believe. God means a different thing to everyone who believes it exists, because god's opinions are just whatever your opinions are. No matter what you believe, if you believe in a god, you believe that god agrees with you. That's how religion works, and so the beliefs of the people are what needs to be addressed, and the methods they use to justify them, not the beliefs of the people thousands of years ago who wrote the book they reference.",

Yet, I think we all agree that this is no basis to get rid of the US government.\n\nThe Church holds a very different kind of authority than the government\u2026 they cannot \u2018punish\u2019 anyone who doesn\u2019t very explicitly allow themselves to be \u2018punished\u2019 (punished in this case referring to the withholding of Communion and perhaps excommunication. Both of which can be reversed.) The Church is a body that exists for the good of those who follow it (and prospective followers). \n\nThat is: if you believe in God, and specifically subscribe to the infallibility of the office of the Pope, the Church tells us how to best live our lives in accordance with God\u2019s will. The fact that so many do not follow these guidelines is, in my understanding, not an indictment on the Church. It\u2019s just a symptom of humanity. We are sinners. None of us live exactly how we are supposed to, but we can try (though, admittedly, not as many try as are supposed to.)\n\nBut overall, I don\u2019t think your argument holds ground logically for abolishing the church just because people do not follow its edicts. That implies that if people *did* follow its teachings that you would be fine with it existing, which I highly doubt. And if you would be fine with it existing given people following its teachings, then it doesn\u2019t seem logically complete to wish for its abolishment instead of its improvement.\n\nI do not refute the pedophilia horribleness. Absolutely vile people have found their way into the church and caused permanent damage to so many. \n\nI think the answer, however, is not to get rid of the establishment which they abused, but instead to improve it as to not let it happen again. We also have pedophilia issues in our public schools, and while, to-date, they have taken more decisive action, we probably all agree that getting rid of public schools was not the answer.",

Humans break laws all the time, but we don't act like we care about those laws. We don't identify by the laws. When I jaywalk, I just.. don't care. I don't pretend to be a perfect example of US law. If someone murders someone, they don't care about the law against it in the first place. The law means nothing to them if they are willing to murder someone. \n\nCatholics, on the other hand, do care about these things. Or at least they say or think they do. They act like they want to live a proper and pious life, they preach it, but they behave differently. Then they think they can be absolved of their *intentional* wrongdoings by begging a priest, who pretends to have the power of god in him, to forgive them. And when I say intentional, I mean intentional. Sinning doesn't just \"happen\" to us. They choose to sin despite knowing - and feeling, or acting like they care - it's wrong. Fornication. Adultery. Gambling. Yes, everyone does those things, but those of us that are free from the morals set by the Catholic Church don't have any reason to not do those things outside of our own morals.\n\nThink one thing, do another. Cognitive dissonance.\n\nI *don't* think jaywalking is wrong. That's why I do it. I do think murdering people for no valid reason is wrong, and that's why I don't do it. I don't care that the US law says to not do it. I wouldn't do it regardless of the law. \n\nCatholics *do* think having sex outside of marriage is wrong.\n\nThey *do* think homosexuality is wrong.\n\nYet they do those things still. \n\nMan, I feel bad for Christians and Catholics that are innocently homosexual, but have to live with the daily cognitive dissonance of being told - and perhaps even believing - that it's wrong. \n\nAlso, I never mentioned abolishing churches or religion, so I'm not really sure why that came up. I mean, we can talk about that if you want - I have plenty of grievances about churches, how they're run, how churches are often *not* separated from the state, etc.",

Your thoughts on whether or not you *think* it\u2019s wrong are entirely irrelevant to the gov\u2019t.\n\nCatholics are the same way (excepting cases of ignorance, which applies to both). Catholics *know* sex outside marriage is wrong, yet they do it anyway.\n\nIn both cases, the law is being broken. In both cases, steps must be undertaken to be \u2018forgiven\u2019. In the Catholic church, all that requires is a confession and a promise to God to do better. In US penal code, it requires prison time, fines, or some other punishment.\n\nCatholics (and anyone) choosing to sin is like the bread and butter of Catholicism. The church itself literally exists *because* humans will choose to sin (see: Adam and Eve). It is our nature. The Church exists to guide us to live better and to provide a pathway for reuniting with God.\n\nAlso, I greatly hope there are no Catholics out there pretending to be the perfect example of Catholic law\u2026 that would be greatly wrong (though, people do wrong things all the time). I\u2019m unsure, but I feel that could be considered blasphemy (as only Mary and Jesus were free of sin).\n\nYour ultimate criticism is that Catholics harbor the correct action in their mind yet go against that. I don\u2019t know enough about Cognitive Dissonance to say if that is or isn\u2019t CD, but I can tell you that\u2019s something everyone experiences: religious or not.\n\nTake cheating on a test at school. Regardless of any religion, I like to think a student knows cheating is wrong. They know cheating is wrong, but they go against that and cheat anyway. This is not an indictment on the thought that cheating is wrong (that\u2019s pretty clearly correct), it\u2019s a failure on the part of the student. They didn\u2019t think cheating was *right*, they just morally failed in the moment.

The church exists, quite literally, to cement and foster cognitive dissonance. It is a ritual and a community designed to keep and push its constituents deeper and deeper into cognitive dissonance. Many, if not most other religions have the same purpose. You can scroll down and read [Lynn's response here](https://www.quora.com/What-role-does-cognitive-dissonance-play-in-religious-belief) - he explained it well.\n\nThat's really my overall point. Outside of Christianity/Catholicism/other religions, there are no \"moral failures\" as you put it. There is no one, no thing, no god, no establishment to answer to. I abide by my own morals. I have sex outside of marriage and that is *not* wrong to me. If Catholics truly cared - if they truly held their beliefs as strongly as they pretend to - they *would not* do it. I *would not* murder without a reason. I think you and I will have to agree to disagree on this particular metaphor. I believe Catholicism (aka religion) \"law\" is incomparable to any other form of law. \n\nOne final example, using a different term (one of my favorites): A non-religious dude that masturbates is not a hypocrite for masturbating if he doesn't believe it's wrong. A Catholic man *is* a hypocrite for masturbating if he believes it's wrong.

                                  "text": "Lynn's Quora response was certainly an interesting read. Something to think about. Of course, he doesn't postulate that the Church's *purpose* is to push people into CD, he just claims that it is a fundamental symptom of faith.  This is, at the very least, less overtly diabolical.  \n\nRegarding the \"hypocrisy\" statement. I think obviously, with the given definition, I would agree with you that one who believes one thing and acts another way is behaving hypocritically. Of course, as a former Catholic, you know that Catholics seek forgiveness for that very hypocrisy (which we literally call mortal sin).\n\nEssentially, the 'agree-to-disagree' that is going to occur here is the existence of objective morality. This is a premise that unfortunately dictates the rest of the terms. In the case where objective morality exists (my position), this hypocrisy is of no import, as the offending person's 'belief' in the objective morality is unimportant entirely to its quality as an action. In the case of subjective morality (your position), the hypocrisy is quite relevant, as it shows they do not adhere to their own moral code.\n\nThis is not really meant to convince you of objective morality (I am certain I have not the knowledge nor the skill to do that), just pointing out where our conversation diverges in terms of base-premises.\n\nNow, back to the original point: I was refuting a poster that says that the Bible does not say pedophilia is wrong. While at this point, this is quite narrow in scope, I think (besides the fact that we disagree quite obviously on the existence of God and the consequences of that) that I can provide (and did provide) at least solid evidence that the Bible and the church does indeed condemn pedophilia. Insofar as doing so is mortal sin.\n\nJust as an aside note: When you mention that the church believes homosexuality is wrong; that is not (fully) true. The Catholic Church, to my knowledge, believes only that marriage (within the church) is between a man and a woman. It also believes sodomy is wrong and sex outside of marriage is wrong. Essentially, the church is fully accepting of one being homosexual, just condemns sex outside of marriage and sodomy. I'll link the catechism entry (it's quite short) [here](http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/2358.htm).",

A moral principle can never be a completely empirical fact - therefore it cannot be completely determined by scientific investigation. What I would say is that morality has mostly subjective and, in specific applications, some objective aspects. I also see that you are applying the naturalistic fallacy - common amongst the \"it's human nature\" crowd. Human nature does not dictate morality, but it may inform it. \n\nObjective morality requires a lawgiver; in your stance, that lawgiver is god; so how does god derive his morality?\n\n\"God says so\" is not a sufficient way to live. \n\nIf you want my source on these thoughts (they are not all originally mine) I'd be happy to share. Overall I think that humanity's moral code is pretty obvious to most rational thinkers, but as soon as I am told that god willed it, it's out the window because neither you nor I can prove or disprove god. \n\nRegarding pedophilia, if you want to believe that Catholicism \"implicitly\" condemns it, that's fine. I truthfully don't see the value in determining whether it is implicitly or explicitly condemned. It's one of those \"most rational people know this is wrong\" things. It's also incredibly ironic how *pervasive* it is in the Catholic Church. \n\nI'm fully aware of the Catholic church's literal stance on homosexuality, and it doesn't actually matter, because it's bullshit regardless. You can't say \"it's ok that you're homosexual, but YOU are not allowed to have sex how you want, with whom you want. Only straight couples can, and it can only be done this way.\"\n\nAgain, this is cognitive dissonance - this is so clearly fucked up, but the brainwashing that Catholics endure utterly prevents them from being able to see that. That's horrifying. \n\nTwo theology teachers were fired from my Catholic/Jesuit high school for being homophobic and teaching strong, traditional Catholic views on homosexuality within classroom walls. I was so happy when I found out that news.",

I only bring it up to remind you that I was responding to a person who said that it was NOT condemned by the Bible. I was just righting a wrong. With no qualitative remark on religion. It was just that they were not correct in their characterization of the Bible. My 'belief' on the matter is of absolutely no import, I was only sharing facts about the Bible that were in opposition to the fiction supposed by the commenter.\n\nNow, with that out of the way, I'm not sure where you get the \"not allowed\" part from in regards to homosexual behavior. They are regarded as 'intrinsically disordered' and thus *sinful*, but beyond that, perfectly 'allowed' (just if you do so, you stray from God, which is extremely sad and unfortunate). The Catholic framework, as stated earlier, exists *solely* to guide us towards God. So it's \"not allowed\" in the same sense that divorced and remarried straight couples having sex is also \"not allowed\" yet these things happen all the time. The only purpose of the Church is to tell us that doing these things separates us from God.\n\nI ask you, in your own moral framework: What is the amoral nature of believing something is wrong? Is there something intrinsically (again, by your own definitions) evil about believing something to be wrong? What's obviously \"fucked up\" about it? \n\nThis especially when, as linked, the official stance is literally:\n>\"They must be accepted with respect, compassion, and sensitivity. Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided.\"\n\nIt is understandably hard (ie impossible) to live perfectly morally, and it is officially understood that these people have an extra cross to bear. If they ever do sin regarding their homosexuality, they are performing no worse an act than the straight couple who re-wedded without annulment and have sexual relations. And they are equally welcome to God's mercy through confession. Sin is part of the human experience.\n\nNinja Edit: I would certainly appreciate any sources I could read, especially strict philosophical argumentation and defense. (But I will genuinely read whatever you give me.)",

The premise that all this Federal money went directly to a bunch of rapists is a bit unfair. In reality it probably only went to a small handful of rapists.

Despite the terrible harm done to children.  Which the church is hesitant to admit to or pay for.  But as long as the necessary formula of confession, admission to sin and forgiveness happen each time, then okay, forgiveness.  Each time.\n\nGay people getting married have committed to the lifelong practice of the \"sin\" of homosexuality.  They're notoriously living in sin, not admitting to sin, not asking to be forgiven, and not getting divorced.  Now, if they had a string of drunken, regretted homosexual dalliances, and admitted to the sin each time, confessed each time, got forgiven each time, etc., that would be ... okay?\n\nAnd in fact that's what a lot of gay people did as a lifestyle before they had the option of marriage.\n\nOf course that creates a mess - self-hate, VD, an unfulfilled life...\n\nMeanwhile, married gay couples seem to want to follow what otherwise looks like a traditional, church-approved married life.\n\nSo, yeah, standard mess created by legislating religious Bronze Age morality.\n\nAlso, it's very possible the actual, real translation of the text may be about pedophilia, based on a known historical Jewish rejection of the practices of the ancient Greeks, who habitually raped little boys (and, most importantly, without additionally confessing, repenting, and being forgiven each time.)\n\nThe More You Know.",

They still commonly marry in most of the Orthodox Churches, and virtually all of the Protestant denominations. Bishops are unmarried, because there are clear instructions on that point, but priests are fine. \n\nBasically, the Church wants people who have ambition and want to become bishops. So they put this bullshit in the catechism about:\n\n>\tAll the ordained ministers of the Latin Church, with the exception of permanent deacons, are normally chosen from among men of faith who live a celibate life and who intend to remain celibate \"for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.\" Called to consecrate themselves with undivided heart to the Lord and to \"the affairs of the Lord\", they give themselves entirely to God and to men. Celibacy is a sign of this new life to the service of which the Church's minister is consecrated; accepted with a joyous heart celibacy radiantly proclaims the Reign of God.\n\nBut it\u2019s clearly resulting in high numbers of gay priests (not a problem for normal people, but a problem for the Church) and pedophiliac priests (a problem for everyone\u2026except, apparently, those priests).

The Church's position is that being gay is not a sin, and no one should treat someone poorly or think ill of them because they are gay. Having sex with a member of the same sex is a sin, not being attracted to a member of the same sex.\n\n> They dont think pedophilia is something to be concerned about\n\nThis is also not true. The abuse of children (in any form) is a sin in the Catholic Church. Rape violates the Catechism of the Catholic Church and there have been a number of official Catholic writings on the need to treat children with respect and care as a matter of doctrine.\n\nIt's not that the Church doesn't consider these things to be problematic, it's that they treated such matters as a) purely internal to the Church and did not involve external authorities and b) relied upon the process of confession and repentance to resolve what were clearly deeply ingrained mental illness around the abuse of children.\n\n> A lot of these priests molest young boys, not girls...\n\nThis was generally more a matter of opportunity than anything else. Priests had a great deal of unsupervised access to young boys. It's also important to note that the rate of abuse wasn't higher than (and in many cases was lower than) that of abuse among the general population. The abuse itself wasn't the issue. Priests are human and some humans are terrible people. It was the fact that the Church never reported these incidents and in many cases did not limit abusers' access to new victims.",

She ended up pregnant again and the doctor said that for her own life she should abort. The priest of her church heard this and got everyone together at the church to admonish them for even considering abortion. They didn't care if anyone else's life was at risk, it was all about the baby. My Grandfather was furious that they cared so little about her life and supposedly it's what caused them to leave the church. The church always been fucked.",

                      "text": "I can agree that there is a huge *doctrinal* gap in the scenario you mentioned, but I think that it glosses over something important. Both groups read the same bible, but the progressive group likely interprets passages differently in their church doctrine. The history you mentioned is gruesomely rife with examples of Catholics and other christians turning a blind eye to Christ's teachings and using doctrine to justify harm, but through that history a core faith based on love and sacrifice persisted to modern day that is handed to you from the many generations that suffered in the less enlightened eras of humanity.  Although your two groups from the example may be far apart from each other with regard to GSRM perspectives, as Christians they are challenged to both view their lives and choices from the lens of the same Gospel.\n\nThat gospel has a letter written to first century christians advising them about their divergent beliefs and advising them on how the gospel can give them a perspective about placing spiritual concerns over their worldly selves. For example, the apostle Paul advises (in 1 Corinthians) them that it is better to be unmarried if that is something they can manage, but if that is not within them then they should get married. Someone with a fundamentalist interpretation might say that this applies to rigidly men and women in the specific context that was mentioned, but I would argue that figuratively it applies to any gender, relationship, or sexual orientation. Rather than focusing on what is righteous or sinful, we should put our focus on Christ's message to us and his sacrifice for us. A member of either congregation in your example can look to that passage and recognize that a focus on our mortal lives is a distraction from our spiritual ones; and that our piety and sexuality are likely to be at odds with each other. \n\nI don't have the training or insight to understand the range of factors that contribute to the making of a molester as you described, but I know that it is as complex as any deranged and predatory behavior. Delusions, psychological issues, sick desires, social influences, and opportunities all seem to contribute to the problem of molestation, and I think it needs to be treated as the insidious cancer that it is. I'm reminded of Acts 5:1-11, where a couple exploited an early church and was met with rather instant and severe justice. I don't think we should ever sanction the taking of life, but I interpret that lesson to mean that people will join the church to prey upon it, and that predators should be separated from church body. We don't have God's divine barcode scanner to know who is a predator and who is a sinner, but I think the leadership of the church are charged to do their best at being the shepherds of the men, women, and children of the church. I feel the same revulsion that you do, and do my best to learn, look, and listen for the threats that we have regrettably learned to watch out for in our schools, churches, and positions of power.",

This was when they were seeking advice after he came out to them. My brother was always a much better Catholic than me. If he's not going because he's gay then I don't buy into this system. After that all the dominoes fell. \n\nI'm really surprised my parents stuck with the church. A couple years ago I finally had a cathartic argument with my mom and ended up telling her I didn't believe in the church or a god. She seemed really offended but I just explained that it didn't fit with how she raised me to be so accepting. I wasn't willing to just pick and choose what I would and wouldn't believe about the religion.",

Good-sized portions of what we do have are full of holes.\n\nBeing also gay doesn't score them any points from me in regards to this topic either.\n\n(Also the cosmology of Gnosticism puts the creator god YHWH as the closest thing to a devil that exists, so as I see it Abrahamic religions are essentially devil worshippers. Gnosticism doesn't really have a \"devil\" like Christianity but that view is close enough, in lieu of explaining a bunch of bullshit mythology on /r/atheism like anyone cares lmao.)\n\nGenocide against my beliefs, discrimination against me and people that I love, and (less relevant to you guys) \"devil\" worship... and that's just grievances against me personally, so suffice to say yeah, *fuck* the Catholic church. I ain't an atheist but I'll stand right the fuck beside you guys against the Catholic church and in favor of a secular society.",

      "text": "\"Gays\" are *the* enemy of Christianity in the 21st century.  No other group and no other sin comes close to getting the negative attention received by the LGBT community.  \n\nIt used to be that the most heinous, egregious sin was to not acknowledge and worship God as the one and only Supreme Being.    Nothing else could earn you more of God's wrath than failing to observe that one core concept.\n\nIn this modern consumerist world, however, that has become too uncomfortable.  Always being mindful of and thankful to God is tedious and annoying.  Asking yourself, \"Should I do this?\" every time you're about to do something is lame.  No one has time for that with their job, family, bills and half dozen streaming subscriptions.  What's more, individual politics has replaced religious belief as the key source of identity.  Move over God.\n\nThat being said, Christians still need a scapegoat for when things in the world go wrong and politics alone doesn't cut it as an explanation.  They need a target to beat up for earning Afterlife Brownie Points.  Heathens used to suffice, but now it causes too many economic and diplomatic problems to go after them too hard. Greedy, selfish, dishonest and criminal people are also no longer comfortable targets, because then in most cases you'd have to target yourself as well as everyone else around you.\n\nEnter the humble homosexual.  Long hated, long marginalized and never in possession of any reliable means of self defense.  The perfect answer to people who want to keep pretending to be righteous believers when their society and culture are no longer compatible with the tenets of their faith.  Blame everything on them.  Point to them as the source of whatever you consider immoral in the world.  Attack them to bribe God into overlooking your laundry list of brutal sins.  \n\nExcepting contrary politics there is nothing that fundamentalist, evangelical Christians hate more than the LGBT movement.  Even atheists are a secondary plague by comparison.",

Theres a lot of stories out there about this.\n\n Disclaimer: I have no issue with LGBTQ folks or anything like that, but I DO have a problem with the Catholic church lol",

So these people are for the first time being confronted with the fact that you can't rigidly follow scripture and still be \"good\". I hesitate to say that last line because \"love your neighbor\" and \"let he without sin cast that first stone\" and other less readily quotable lines actually leave open the possibility of acceptance of other peoples choices and beliefs in life and leaving judgment to God after death but thats not the approach the vocal portion settle on and it hasn't ever been the position of the church",

We also know that the official doctrine of the Catholic Church (as well as most Protestant denominations) is that of original sin. Original sin being the concept that mankind is inherently sinful due to the actions of Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden. So if homosexuality is a sin, then it should be easily forgiven through faith in Christ like all other sin. This begs the question, what seems to be these churches\u2019 problem? They\u2019ll happily forgive a repentant wife beater or drug addict, but a gay person is unforgivable? Isn\u2019t the idea that god will forgive all who have faith in him? These are not the judgments of god, but the judgments of man. It is unbiblical to reject sinners as churches are supposedly hospitals for the sickness of sin.\n\nThat being said it\u2019s all bullshit, but that delves into circlejerk territory. My point is that it\u2019s inherently unbiblical to reject a gay person for sinning, when sin is viewed as inherent to being human",

This is the person who stands/sits in front of the congregation week in and week out and leads the sacred music for the parish. \n\nThis person also likely signed a code of conduct agreement.\n\nIt stands to reason that this person ought to share our faith, no? It seems that getting married in direct defiance of not only a code of conduct agreement between you and your employer, but in defiance of the sacred values the religious hold is brazenly disrespectful. Why is he surprised they let him go for being gay married as an employee of a Catholic church?\n\n\nThis would be like someone high up in PETA who also owns a Joe Exotic style ranch. \n\nOr a person who works for a Jewish school and sells nazi paraphenalia on eBay as a side hustle.\n\nIt's odd to me why atheists think this level of disrespect for our beliefs and traditions is okay, but the two above mentioned offenses would be okay.",

But not when it endorses slavery of marriage by rape. They want it when they want to beat people over the head with a original sin, but not when it talks about God commanding his followers to wipe out entire cities except for the pre-teen virgin girls which are to be taken as rape-slaves.\n\n\nThey want Jesus, but they want to ignore the part where Jesus endorses the old testament and *specifically stated* that the old testament was not to be discarded.\n\n\nHowever, all of that's moot: this isn't a thread about what the bible says. This is a thread about the Catholic church being a corrupt, criminal organisation, and the world's largest pedophile ring. Which it would still be *no matter what* the bible said.",

Most of the priests caught do in fact get punished. Not a single Catholic I have ever known (and I grew up/am Catholic) thinks that the sexual abuse from those priests are okay and it\u2019s certainly not in line with church teaching. \nAlso, simply *being* gay isn\u2019t a sin according to the Church, but it doesn\u2019t allow for gay marriage/intimacy between same sex couples.

Just the actions of sexual intimacy outside of marriage, but like I said, that applies to heterosexual people as well. Unfortunately, many Christians take verses out of context to be hateful toward the gay community. \nThe priests/pastors who commit rape against children or anyone else should be kicked out of the priesthood/church (as well as those who cover it up), and any Catholic who defends their actions should also leave the church. This teacher getting fired for having a gay marriage has nothing to do with homophobia. Teachers get fired from Catholic schools all of the time for not setting an proper example.",
