                  "text": "With the annexation of Austria, a large amount of catholics [became absorbed into the reich](https://www.jstor.org/stable/25020179). \n\nThe germans had [chaplains/Kriegspfarrer](https://thechaplainkit.com/chaplains/foreign-chaplains/germany/) of catholic and protestant denominations, but in foriegn units you had Imans (13th SS haandaschaar) and Orthodox Chaplains.  \n>\nPrior to the introductions of conscription (1935), there were only 8 full-time chaplains (all denominations), supervised by two military bishops. By 1942, there were some 480 Protestant chaplains and probably a similar number of Catholic chaplains; the total was roughly one-quarter of that in WW1. It seems that no new chaplains were appointed after 1942, although there was no dearth of applicants. Applicants had to be born before 1909 (but there were exceptions), had to be approved by the base commander, the military bishop, the Ministry of Church Affairs, and they had to have a Gestapo clearance (Bergen, 1997).\n\n To understand that origin goes back to a man named [Franz Rarkowski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Justus_Rarkowski) whose official title \"Field Bishop of the German Army\" was a result of the [Reichskonkordat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichskonkordat). Though this is a whole other discussion outside of Field Chaplains.  But it is important because of a clause that would mention with conscription being reintroduced that catholic chaplains would be allocated.\n[There is an example in the finnish SS unit that they had a liason who acted in the capacity as a kriegspfrarr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalervo_Kurkiala) but this primary account delves further into the later Waffen SS formations of 44-45 who \"had\" chaplains\n>\nChaplains are only attached to the SS divs which were recruiting Volksdeutsche at the time of their formation. In contrast, in the German Army (Heer) a Protestant or Catholic field chaplain, generally holding the rank of Major, is attached to every division.\n>\nIt can be assumed that in the Waffen-SS divisions there is no church parade. PW [Prisoner of War] added in this connection that a guard of honour (Ehrenwache) was often posted in the case of SS members who had been killed in action. In the case of Catholic members of the SS, arrangements could be made by special request for the sacrament of Extreme Unction to be given by a chaplain from another division.\"\n\nOn the question of Ernst Biberstein, like many SS officers with a theological background and later served with the Einsatzgruppen in Russia, he \"Renounced the Church\" in Dec 1938, some 14 years after being ordained a priest.\n(Biberstein statement, 7 January 1946)\n\nHere is a great sourced post on C[hristmas under the Nazi's in 194](https://forum.axishistory.com/viewtopic.php?f=44&t=246159&p=2240576&hilit=chaplains#p2240576)4, and how religion was twisted by the Nazi's to match their message.",

That is not to say it is black and white and there were those who were Christians who also saw a natural binding of their faith to the NSDAP. But you are not going to over turn 430 years of the protestant reformation, the German Peoples revolt, and the unifications of Germany in 1871, in under 9 years. So im not denying that their was a large religious contingent, but dont think the NSDAP believed themselves to be Christian saviours, that is what their propaganda wants you to believe due to thats how they garnered average public support.

Yes, there absolutely were collaborators in all captured territories who are as much at fault as volunteer(!) Wehrmacht forces or members of the NSDAP.\n\nI also never said that every single clergyman was supportive of them, just that the picture that is often painted of the poor poor church having been a victim of the evil fascist state when they were, as an institution, one of its strongest facilitators, is BS.\n\nThe people of the Third Reich were extremely religious to the point that the strongest political power that arose after the fall of the regime, literally has \"Christian\" in its name. The \"Christlich Demokratische Union\" (Christian Democrat Union). It's the party of Konrad Adenauer and Angela Merkel.\n\nHell, you can even be fined for certain kinds of blasphemy to this day, although it's a rarely executed law.\n\nMy point is, if the church had taken a stand and forced the people to choose between it and the state, the outcome would have been uncertain. Instead, the Holy See signed the Reichskonkordat and the vast majority of churches were just as complicit as the populace at large. Once it was all over, everyone and their mother was \"secretly opposed to it all along\".\n\nAlso, personal pet peeve of mine, in your last sentence, it should have been \"than\".",

They took over art, music, literature, healthcare, libraries, public schools, and on and on.\n\nAlbert Speer famously said he was so good at his job that \"80 million people were deprived of independent thought\". \n\nGoebbels' main job was to make Hitler front and center of a cult of personality, no matter what. Which might sound very familiar, but his efforts were a little more far-reaching than a right-wing not-news channel's.",

So yes, in terms of body count obviously Goebbel's is much worse, but in the number of minds that have been poisoned Murdoch gives him a run for his money.\n\nEven worse in my mind is Murdoch has done it all for money and power, Goebbel's was a deeply fanatical Nazi who believed in what he was doing and wound up committing suicide with his wife after killing his six children because they couldn't conceive of a world without Hitler.  While Murdoch is more of an evil parasite trying to enrich himself and his family regardless of the consequences.",

Here's part of an interview with him in his cell at Nuremberg, taken from Dr. G.M. Gilbert's 1976 book \"The Memory of Justice\":\n\nG\u00f6ring: Why, of course, the people don't want war. Why would some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best that he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece? Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia nor in England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship.\n\nGilbert: There is one difference. In a democracy, the people have some say in the matter through their elected representatives, and in the United States only Congress can declare wars.\n\nG\u00f6ring: Oh, that is all well and good, but, voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country.\n\nStill sounding very familiar!",

Because it was novel, and because it was controlled, people were moved.  The idea that your leader could speak directly to you, and regularly, especially as someone who didn't live in the capital, that was kind of enchanting, where previously all you saw was reports in newspapers, or heard things passed on by local officials. \n\nLater though, when the novelty wore off, it stops being enchanting, and is no more meaningful than the newspaper was or Mister Rogers was when you were a kid. Lots of people talk to you, and you know they aren't talking to YOU. \n\nI think with the Internet we could have had something similar. In fact, I think we're kind of still working through it, and while the Internet was at least as revolutionary as Radio, the difference is it wasn't as easy to understand how to politically manipulate it. The novelty of Internet comes from the many-to-many communication. It took a while for people in power to recognize that to manipulate it, they had to harness the many, the social media aspect. It took a while for social media to even enter the scene, and then that's a bit harder to directly manipulate. \n\nOn the other hand, it's really effective at totally enrapturing people and self perpetuating, as well as concealing its source. \n\nBut Goebbels today wouldn't be that proficient. The fact was just being in charge of radio back then made it relatively easy to manipulate the masses. In the same way that Ed Sullivan would probably do terribly in todays attention economy.",

That didn't work so I found the biggest Crip I could and gave him a free tattoo, which made me and my tattoo gun \"tainted\" and \"unclean\". Solved the problem, and I ended up making a ton of prison money tattooing black guys, as well as a ton of friends and understanding. I actually went in there a Trump supporter in 2016 and now I have antifa tattoos lol. Learned a hell of a lot. Very few white supremacists in prison were actually bout that life.

In his book, Mein Kampf, Hitler described the struggle for world domination as an ongoing racial, cultural and political battle between Aryans and non-Aryans. He envisaged a \"ladder\" of racial hierarchy, asserting that German >\"Aryans\" were at the top of the ladder, while Jews and Gypsies were consigned to the bottom of the order. On Hitler's racial ladder, Arabs and Muslims occupied a servile place, held in much the same contempt as the Jews.  \nHitler made a personal remark in 1939 in which he referred to the populace of the Middle East as \"painted half-apes that ought to feel the whip\".  \n>As in other instances, however, the Nazis never allowed their ideological views to get in the way of more urgent political considerations. The Nazis recognized the importance of wooing the Arab and Muslim world to their side and, in their public proclamations, downplayed their real views of Muslims and Arabs. When Mein Kampf was being translated into Arabic in 1938, Hitler himself tactfully proposed to omit from it his \"racial ladder\" theory.\n\n[source](http://www.projetaladin.org/holocaust/en/40-questions-40-answers/the-nazis-the-holocaust-and-muslims.html)",

There's a difference between aligning with your colonizer's opposition and suggesting genocide.\n\nFirst of all, Al-Husseini was not elected by Palestinians. He lost in 4th place, but as it is now and then, Palestinian votes don't matter and their imperialists choose, so Britian appointed him. Al-Husseini\u2019s motivation for embracing the Axis was likely a combination of selfish political opportunism and the belief that the alignment would help safeguard against the takeover of Palestine by the Zionists. The reasoning, however grotesque, was the same used by Lehi (the \u2018Stern Gang\u2019) in its own attempted collaboration with the fascists: Britain was the obstacle both to Palestinian liberation, and to unbridled Zionism, and for both the Mufti and Lehi, defeating that obstacle meant embracing its enemies. Even the \u2018mainstream\u2019 David Ben-Gurion had no moral qualms about taking advantage of Britain\u2019s struggle against the Nazis \u2014 a struggle for which his Jewish Agency was already conspicuously unhelpful \u2014 by exploiting Britain\u2019s post-war vulnerabilities.\n\nPosterity has treated Lehi\u2019s and the Mufti\u2019s flirtations with the fascists quite differently. Lehi, the most fanatical of the major Zionist terror organizations, was transformed into freedom fighters, and ex-Lehi leader Yitzhak Shamir was twice elected as Israeli Prime Minister. In contrast, Zionist leaders quickly seized on al-Husseini\u2019s past to smear not just him, but the Palestinians as a people, as Nazis.\n\nThe use of al-Husseini\u2019s unsavory history to \u2018justify\u2019 anti-Palestinian racism continues to the present day. Most bizarrely, in 2015 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed that Hitler had not intended to exterminate the Jews \u2014 that is, not until al-Husseini planted the words in his ear \u2014 which translates as \u201cgot the idea from the Palestinians\u201d. A private citizen would likely have been arrested under German law for this attempt to rewrite the Holocaust.",

If you accept that the F\u00fchrer dictates the values of the movement, then it was a christian movement. However, if you require a christian movement to have 100% of its leaders to be christian, then it wasn't.\n\nAnd then you have the occult pagan quasi-religion of the SS. That one was less known to the public, but its existence is well documented to historians.\n\nIf you compare this to the truly anti-religious government of the GDR, there is a stark contrast. The SED, the leading party of the GDR, pretty much banned and persecuted religion, and they presented the civil ideal as non-religious. There were no GDR-issued prayer books, and no correlate to \"Gott mit uns\". That's what I would call a truly anti-religious government.\n\nBut declaring a government as anti-religious or even just non-religious where the revered F\u00fchrer of the people says that a good citizen is a christian, where the state issues prayer books ... nah.\n\nWe don't know if Hitler actually held christian beliefs in private, but there are reasons to believe that he did at least to some extent. I think that for the least, he held the idea that there is a teleological purpose to existence, and likely also a god-like figure. But for what he publicly represented, his private beliefs are not really relevant.\n\nIf the Nazi regime hadn't been stopped, I personally entertain the idea that some kind of state-given religion would have evolved, as a combination of christian and pagan teachings. Given enough time, they would certainly have turned their backs to the Vatican as well. The occult SS religion would have gotten more public attention, and a certain mishmash of the christian and pagan traditions would have developed. The state could then have made it explicit and legitimize it by introducing it into their public rites, which started at a rather young age. But that's just my personal pet theory.\n\nAt least I don't believe that Hitler would have backpedaled and declare belief in god as irrational or against the Nazi ideology or anything. Not after all of those years of preaching christianity.",

If you are willing to spend the time, I would find it kind of you to point out exactly where the contradiction lies.\n\nWith \"preaching\" christianity, I meant the F\u00fchrer's idealization of christianity. As I wrote, Hitler presented the ideal image of a German also as, among other things, a christian.\n\nAs far as sources go, I'll have to search for them right now, and my time is limited. I have seen recordings of several speeches of Hitler in German, where I've heard him drive home the ideal of the German christian, but of course not remembered their links or sources. I know about the state-issued christian prayer book carried by the soldiers because my grandfather was one of those soldiers, and he told me about it.\n\nHere is an excerpt from the Nazi Party Platform:\n\n>We demand the freedom of all religious confessions in the state, insofar as they do not jeopardize the state's existence or conflict with the manners and moral sentiments of the Germanic race. The Party as such upholds the point of view of a positive Christianity without tying itself confessionally to any one confession. It combats the Jewish-materialistic spirit at home and abroad and is convinced that a permanent recovery of our people can only be achieved from within on the basis of the common good before individual good.\n\nThis is not unreligious, or rather exactly as unreligious as the current German christian party CDU.\n\n[Here](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691148052/the-aryan-jesus) I found a book in which it is shown that protestant theologians in Nazi Germany redefined Jesus as an Aryan.\n\nI also found [this article](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/the-german-churches-and-the-nazi-state) that comes to the conclusion that both major christian churches first supported the Nazi regime and over time became more and more critical an averse to it. However, this is only tangential, as it does not tell us anything about the official religiousness or unreligiousness of the ideal of the state government.\n\nHowever, [this article](https://dumas.ccsd.cnrs.fr/dumas-01207326/document), written in German, gives two quotes from Hitler, the second of which contradicts what I wrote:\n\n1. \"So glaube ich heute im Sinne des Allm\u00e4chtigen Sch\u00f6pfers zu handeln: Indem ich mich des Juden erwehre, k\u00e4mpfe ich f\u00fcr das Werk der Herrn\" -- I translate: \"So I believe that I act according to the will of the almighty creator today: By fighting against the jews, I fight for the work of the Lord.\"\n2. \"Eine deutsche Kirche, ein deutsches Christentum ist Krampf. Man ist entweder Christ oder Deutscher. Beides kann man nicht sein.\" -- Again, translation by myself: \"A german church, a german christianity is a convulsion. Either one is a christian or a german. One cannot be both.\"\n\nDespite the last quote, Hitler himself stayed a catholic until his death. As you can read in [the Wikipedia article on Hitler's religious views](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_views_of_Adolf_Hitler), Hitler presented himself as a christian in Mein Kampf, a book which was meant to present Hitler as an authority figure and role model for all Germans. On top of this, the article also mentions with sources that Hitler confirms this view of him as a christian in public speeches. And again, if Hitler does not represent the Nazi regime's view of an ideal German, then who does?\n\nWhen you read further in the article, you see that Hitler contradicted himself on this on several occasions. But still, I think that the majority of the public saw him as a christian, because this is what he most prominently presented himself as. You also learn about the ambiguous and changing roles that both churches played in the story of the Third Reich.\n\nI also found [this excerpt from Christopher Hitchens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRBrjt7z5Cw) in which he explains in brief why the Nazi regime cannot be called secular. There are better and longer renditions of this topic in other speeches of Hitchens, but unfortunately I don't have the time to go through them now.\n\nOn Hitler's speech where he was declaring a good German as a christian, I didn't find it right now. Mainly because the original recordings of Hitler's speeches are ridiculously hard to find on the internet. Probably for obvious reasons, you find a lot of commentary _about_ those speeches, but have a hard time finding the actual speeches uncommented. I believe this was in a popular speech to the german youth, in which Hitler presented his ideal view of a German, but I might be misremembering this aspect.\n\nOverall, I can understand why some people believe that the Nazi state was secular or non-religious. But overwhelmingly, their public self-representation was very much related to christianity and god. And the leading figure was a catholic who never renounced his faith or his affiliation with catholicism. This taken together with the party's party platform upholding what they call a \"positive Christianity\", and the vast majority of the population being and staying christian, I think it's an extremely hard point to argue that the Nazi regime overall was non-religious or anti-religious. Yes, there were anti-religious statements even in some interviews with Hitler, and there were non-believers and even anti-christians in the party leadership. But their self-presentation was always conflated with god and christianity, and that's also what you find on the belt buckles of the SS soldiers.",

Do you have any source on some of those being defined differently? Because I'd really like to know if I'm oblivious here.\n\nThe movement was religious, as it stood by the values of what they called \"positive Christianity\". They did not *force* their members to be religious. But being religious is not the same as forcing one's religious values upon others. It's enough that you declare that you follow some kind of religious views. And I've shown how the Nazi party portrayed being a christian, or believing in god, as one of their ideals. Hitler was also publicly critical of atheists. While they didn't strictly force you into religion, in Nazi Germany you had a bad standing amongst others when it was known that you were an atheist. Because their idolized leading figure was a christian and was talking about god all the time. That's not \"not religious\". Again, compare that to the GDR, you will see the stark difference.\n\nThis is like saying that the Red Cross is not religious because they serve anyone. But then you see articles about them refusing to help gays because their religious teaching tells them that gay is bad. That's simply not \"not religious\".\n\nIf a regime is truly not religious, their leader shouldn't be talking about god all the time, they shouldn't give prayer books to their soldiers, not write \"Gott mit uns\" on the belt buckles of their elite soldiers, and not portray the ideal citizen as a christian. Really, I don't know how I can make this any more clear. If this is what you think a non-religious government looks like, I don't think you will find many people agreeing with you.\n\nAnd how have the churches been any pain in the ass for the Nazis? They were more of a small nuisance. Sure, some pastors hid jews from the Nazi persecution. But this was not a huge impact in the numbers. There were pro-Nazi streams in both churches. The Vatican ordered Hitler's birthday to be celebrated once each year in every german church. And in the end, the catholic churches and abbeys helped major Nazi figures to escape. How exactly is this a major pain in the ass?\n\nI'm really running out of time now, I have to run. I might be wrong on this, no disrespect, but could it be that you have some attachment that you want to defend about he Nazi regime being not religious? I've put some effort in this, and your last comment does not seem to fully acknowledge my previous points.",

The stupid thing about this argument in the image though is that there have been countless left and right leaning spectrum countries and states that have all committed some form of atrocities or  fucked up things in the past. Recounting such history doesn't say anything conclusive about people today who lean those ways; it may provide context or damning evidence.\n\nFor example, you're not going to be treated like a slave owner or apologist for simply living or being born in the south or because you vote red. However, if you wave the Confederate flag around and fight to keep certain symbolic statues up for \"historic reasons,\" you may get called out for being racist or slavery apologist.\n\nWhether or not Hitler was a left or right winger doesn't REALLY matter as the way he seized power can be utilized by anyone regardless of political spectrum. But for those who ARE interested in technicalities and finer details\n\n>Nazism is a form of fascism, with **disdain for liberal democracy** and the parliamentary system. It incorporates fervent **antisemitism**, **anti-communism**, **scientific racism**, and the use of **eugenics into its creed**. Its **extreme nationalism** originated in pan-Germanism and the ethno-nationalist neopagan V\u00f6lkisch movement which had been a prominent aspect of German nationalism since the late 19th century, and it was strongly influenced by the Freikorps paramilitary groups that emerged after Germany's defeat in World War I, from which came the party's underlying \"cult of violence\".\\[6\\] Nazism subscribed to **pseudo-scientific theories of a racial hierarchy**\\[7\\] and **social Darwinism**, identifying the Germans as a part of what the Nazis regarded as an Aryan or Nordic master race.\\[8\\] It aimed to overcome social divisions and create a homogeneous German society based on **racial purity** which **represented a people's community** (Volksgemeinschaft). The Nazis aimed to unite all Germans living in historically German territory, as well as gain additional lands for German expansion under the doctrine of Lebensraum and exclude those who they deemed either Community Aliens or \"inferior\" races.\n\nSounds pretty right wing to me. Disdain for liberal democracy. Antisemitism; you have literal GOP senators talking about Jewish space lasers. Anti-communism doesn't need examples. Scientific racism and eugenics; yeah the sub-saharan African and the white community/white genocide & Great Replacement talking points, some of which are known Nazi propagandas like Great Replacement, is constantly being regurgitated on Fox News. Left wingers aren't nearly as nationalistic as right wingers, nevermind there's literally been a rise of extreme nationalism in the alt right for the past few years.",

And they feel confident in doing so simply because everybody else they know is doing the same thing. It's like when all the 7th grade boys are talking about hooking up with their girlfriends who go to other schools - everybody knows everybody else is lying, but they're all just going along with it.\n\nThis guy started with two \"truths\" in his mind: Nazis are bad and Democrats are bad. He's tired of people comparing his train of thought to Nazis, so he's decided that Democrats are actually like Nazis, and he's just *gonna make up the rest as he goes along*. It's the same with people who still spout \"Democrats founded the KKK and are therefore the real racists!\" OK - there's a shred of truth under there but basically everybody who says this **knows** already that it's not meaningful in the way it's being used. They just say it to say it, as if saying it enough makes it true, because they want it to be.",

Last time I checked the internet is capable of millions of search results in seconds, 30-40 minutes of looking into contradictory results etc. gives you a leg to stand on in an argument and most peoples arguments crumble within a few minutes of fact checking them. do whatever, say whatever, I dont care. I'm beyond ready for change in the way people think. If it was up to people like you we would still be in the medieval age I'm sure. A computer can fly a plane with inputs given to it by a person. I can copy and paste those inputs from pastebin if I had my own plane. The vaccine was developed because the same technology we used to map the human genome. To map the genome of a virus it often took 4 years in the past minimum. The entire world got together on this. We have been studying the SARS virus for years. The reason you see people still get sick with the virus is because that's how vaccines work. If you get the flu shot you still have a chance to get the flu. When 100% of a population is vaccinated 100% of the people that get sick will be vaccinated. This isn't difficult to understand. In 1 month we will be launching the James webb telescope. Science has come a long way and I will gladly devote my life to personally helping develop scientific breakthroughs once I'm done with college. They are going to use the same process used for the \"Vaccine\" to develop something that can 100% fight cancer. Is it going to work everytime? No. but it will save lives. I'm getting the vaccine next week because I've already had covid and I genuinely believe if I get it again it will give me long term side effects.

You will will also be old one day.  You will have seen your government, the elites that manage every aspect of our lives, play our fellow citizens time and time again via fear and manipulation.  You will see nonstop example of government waste and grift.  You will see corporations get away with literal widespread poisoning and murder time after time without repercussions of any kind.\n\nYou will see the 'scientists,' 'politicians,' and 'celebrities' lie to everyone's face about things you personally know to be completely false, and your voice will be drowned out in a see of well managed propaganda. You will see your doctors be wrong about vital diagnoses, and you will be lucky if you figure those out times fast.\n\nYou will be paid chump change for the valuable time you spent specializing in a career in a college when you realize the big corporations, with computers, have almost every business baked into basic blueprint blocks. You will get close to minimum wage, while any complex decisions that would require a higher wage are done by small sets of remote management working with algorithms.\n\nThe same way many people believed every claim that got us into the middle east wars, then realized the rich were just there for Oil, that's happening today too.  An invisible flu-like virus is the current modern propaganda tool.\n\nIf you really think you know enough about how the world works to trust that taking some new gene therapy, that just happens to be rolled out by every rich megacorp in the world in perfect sync (for the Flu, not Aids, or Cancer, the Flu) is a good plan, then I have a beautiful bridge to sell you in Brooklyn.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: We picked up this beautiful rescue cat recently. I am not normally into animals, but I really like this cat, he is cool.  So he is missing some hair patches when we got him, his left eye looks rough, usually has goop in the morning.  We take him to the vet at earliest appointment after we got him, vet says probably will clear on it's own, cats can get like that when they are underweight, it will be fine.\n\nI don't like this, mention it a couple times, so we take cat to second Vet.  second Vet says: \"Cat has conjunctivitis.  Good you brought him in.\"  Gives us eyedrops so my cat's eye doesn't fall out.  If I blindly believed things professionals said against my better judgement, my cat could be in bad shape right now.

Kyle then dialed 911 and tried to withdraw from the mob to surrender to the police, then 2 other convicted criminals attacked him, one bashing him with a skateboard and tried to steal his weapon, his heart thanked him. The other, convicted burglar, drew a weapon on him (which he shouldn't have considering his criminal record, a proof that gun control is ineffective because criminals do not care about the law - and Rittenhouse could bear arms thanks to a loophole) and *literally did a war crime of false surrender* before trying to shoot the kid. He still couldn't find his biceps. Oh yeah and pics showed more antifa low lives tried to attack him but backed down. For some reason the police let him go tho.\n\nSo yeah it takes more than 1 minute to have a better understanding. Also you're praising people attacking a kid.",

That's the part of the story that can be taken whichever way they want but the only people involved in the first shooting was rittenhouse and the pedo guy. Me personally. I dont think vigilanty justice should be allowed. That's exactly what he was trying to be. The guy is hopefully going to do a minimum of 5 years because shooting people (even in self defense) deserves prison time.\n\n\nTo be clear the mob reacted naturally to someone getting shot. they didnt have firearms. They were not there playing super hero. Rittenhouse was. And when he shot the first person ofcourse he fled the scene. was there any eye witness testimonies from anyone other than a \"Proud boy?\" it's ironic. the blm people came out in protest of police violence and were met with extreme violence from the police and a fall guy. Call whatever it is that you are defending a good thing but everyone that's involved with the GI Joe army supports bullshit. Let me guess, you believe the election was stolen also?

I'm sure it would get shut down pretty quickly and if someone tries to stop me and I kill them it should be self defense right?\n\n\nIt would actually be Man shoots one person \"allegedly in self defense\" then angry mob forms to stomp him to death.",

What you want him to go to juvy or something? Take him out of the equation and yeah, no one would have been shot. I've read the defense of the 3 people and while I think all pedos should be hung from a light post the other two didnt deserve it. To them this guy just shot someone and he was fleeing the scene. Damn right I wouldve done the same thing regardless of what happened before. I wouldve only tried to disarm and then subdue but I dont think that's what their intentions were. Provide me a source that isn't right leaning that has proof the first person attacked him? From what I gathered yesterday and just now, the first person saw kyle on a roof and he wouldn't let him pass, he said \"shoot me if you are going to already\" and kept going. He eventually sees kyle on the ground and they start insulting each other where kyle fired a shot. Even the \"proud boys\" were like wtf did you just do and Kyle realizes he fucked up. Runs a street or two over and calls the cops, then the mob investigating the shooting comes and sees the guy WHO JUST SHOT SOMEONE and proceeds to attack. Naturally. They were \"fairly\" peaceful protests and someone running around shooting people is not okay. The only good thing I have to say about kyle is that he didnt just start shooting everyone there. The guy killed 3 people regardless of the facts and deserves prison time where he will likely get babied and kept in safe P the entire time he's there.",

I checked out a Republican one and ofcourse it starts off by calling the \"Rioters\" A pedo, a Thief, And a Wife strangler which is hilarious. While I agree that pedos are the scum of the earth should I be shot and killed for stealing the stuff I did when I was younger? It was alot but I've done my time for it and dont plan on stealing more than a pen ever again. What about my domestic abuse charge? that got dropped but it's still on my record. Me and my SO were straight up boxing and slammed the car door so hard it broke the window and the neighbors called the cops. Should I be killed for that? Oh. I fully support standing up for police injustice. The thing they were actually there for. Like when a suspect is running do I shoot him with a pistol or tazer? What about my mace or my club? Try to truly justify murder in any form and it gets kinda hard. I will gladly change my tune if you can prove the first person was shot in self defense, the other two reacted naturally imo to someone shooting. Every one of those protests I expected the \"proud boys\" to wrangle everyone together and just start shooting. Props to them for having self control. \n\n\n\nI guess my only personal question is how do you feel about the Jan 6th attack on the capitol?

Only one Democrat who voted against civil rights legislation in the US Congress switched to the Republicans. The rest of the racist fucks went to the grave as Democrats.\n\nI grew up in the South. While the outward appearance of the Democrat party has gotten cleaned up a lot, most of the politicians and supporters here are still racist as fuck.

The South was much more split on Clinton than on Carter. Until 2000, the only times Republicans took the South were the times when almost every state went red.

If it's an area that is lower income, the schools will receive less funding and generally be of a lower quality, with the outcome being that those children are less likely to escape their lower income situation. Where I live in Ontario, the province funds all of the schools from one big pot of money and the schools are directly funded based on the number of children attending the school. All schools are resourced the exact same here, so in principle, all schools will offer all children the exact same opportunities. Education is also valued here and teachers are paid a wage where they are able to not just live, but thrive. That higher pay attracts better talent, which in theory should result in a quality education for the children.",

A good school would teach that nazis were part of western civ and thought they were saving it from the jews. A bad school would just not teach it at all or give barely any details, but not the opposite of the truth.",

That said, the RE syllabus was obliged to dedicate x % of lesson time to other religions. \n\nStandards is another thing entirely, although the measurement for standards of a school tends to be the grades of the students. \n\n\\*Grant maintained - means the school had pretty much full control over how its funding was spent, although like I said, in my case it was a RC school and therefore had some funding from the RC diocese.",

This year, as in every single year for the last 16 years that I've taught, I was told word for word \"Teach the test\", meaning the standardized test all 8th grade science students in Florida take.\n\nI've been told not to \"editorialize\" during lectures because I said that the decision to not have a mask mandate in our schools was a dumb one that would lead to more infections. (Thanks to Gov. Ron \"I slurp dog cum\" Desantis)\n\nThen I have district folks and my school admins in our rooms all the time bitching. They are micromanaging our teaching almost. They want the common boards for multiple subjects updated daily. Daily lesson plans printed and ready to go. Seating charts updated daily for Covid exposure reasons. I make seating changes all the time for behavior, so this has been a pain.\n\nThen you have millions of assholes telling us we can't teach Critical Race Theory. One, CRT is college curriculum, it has never been K-12. Two, these asshats think legitimate history is teaching CRT and are raising hell about things that have actually been taught for decades now.\n\nBook banning has made a return to my county. That's wonderful.\n\nHaving said all that, I am in a union protected contract, four years out from quitting, and I give no fucks. I say what I want to say, I teach what I want to teach. As long as I cover the standards, I am good. They can't fire me, so I'm going to continue.\n\nThe sad thing is, there are few of us left. All teachers here in my county now are on annual contract, so they are terrified of deviating from the party line so to speak. They won't do anything to get themselves in trouble. In a few more years, kids here will be taught by drones instead of free thinking academics, and that really sucks.",

You can throw all the education in the world at some of these people, but if they don't care enough to retain it they won't. \n\n\nBased on absolutely nothing I don't think 15% of adults could balance a simple chemical equation, or hell even know the symbols for common elements. \n\n\nI'm a pretty smart guy and I remember taking geometry and how to solve for a fuckton of unknowns. I remember like 5% of that at best as an adult.\n\n\nThen you get to the part where even if they DO remember memory is easy as fuck to twist and corrupt. And these qtards spend 90% of their platform time gaslighting supporters on various pieces of history, society, and reality. Let's not forget they've created an alternate reality that their supporters live in. How is education going to help when these people can be completely broken out of our consensus reality?\n\n\nLook at nurses. I know 3 RNs personally who will not get vaccinated or wear maskd. They're more educated on the specific topic than I will ever be bar none. \n\n\nSince they realized that constant lies not only isn't a dealbreaker but instead lets them just shape reality however they want it's so much worse than you think. I really don't think education is quite gonna be able to fix this new wave of fuckery.",

When someone says \"nazis were socialist\" they aren't referring to a faction within the nazi party during its formation, they are referring to the general average of the nazi party, especially during the peak of WWII. Similarly, the strasserists were a faction, and ultimately not the one that became the formal nazi party of germany. Deep diving into the factional politics of the nazi party is interesting on its own, but irrelevant to the discussion of someone saying \"nazis were socialists like democrats.\"\n\nYour second paragraph is entirely useless. I'm elaborating on why you are getting dogpiled and why your bringing up a faction during the early days of the nazi party is entirely irrelevant to the discussion.

Nazis were left wing\n2. Democrats hate Western civilization\n3. Democrats are racist\n4. Democrats support gun control\n5. Democrats support state schools\n6. Democrats support abortion\n7. Democrats support Islam\n\nYou, shitting all over this thread:\n\n>NAZIS ACSHUALLY WERE LEFT WING AT THE START!!!\n\nThe rest of us:\n\n>So fucking what? That has nothing to do with this thread.\n\nOf the stated claims:\n\nOne is wrong. No matter the origin, the Nazis were not left wing. \n\nTwo is just fucking stupid. \n\nThree is hilarious - sure there are racist Democrats, but somehow MOST of the racists seem to flock to the Republicans. \n\nFour is arguable, but all the libs who own guns rather refute that. And it seems like Republicans have voted for actual gun control about as much as any Dems have.\n\nFive is\u2026 what the fuck are they even accusing? Are they arguing against public schools that pretty much all Americans support except the religious fundies who put their kids into inferior religious doctrination? Or are they trying to say that... I dunno... dems want kids in government-controlled camps for indoctrination or something? Who the fuck knows exactly what bullshit this is.\n\nSix is arguably true. I won't rehash the argument except to say: NOBODY wants abortions. Especially late term. You're months into a pregnancy and considering an abortion? You've probably had baby showers and a room set up for the baby. Something extremely terrible has gone wrong that you think terminating the pregnancy is better than allowing a child to be born with whatever problems are that bad. That couple is going to go through a SHIT ton of shit dealing with the most difficult decision they will have made in their lives. Meanwhile, Republicans care about fetuses, but once it's born, fuck 'em, they can live on the street for all they care.\n\nSeven is so achingly stupid. I hate all religion equally, but I stand against racism. When I \"stand up\" for Muslims, it's because some asshole is shitting on brown people. Fuck Islam. Fuck Christianity. Fuck all the fucking religions. For any of the monotheistic ones - those fucking morons only differ from me in all the gods they do NOT believe in by a single one. I grew up believing in Jesus and in Santa. I stopped believing in Santa while I was in single digits. It took me to nearly adulthood to realize Jesus was just as fucking stupid. But as long as religious people don't harm other people, go have your religion - just don't fucking dictate your backwards shit to the rest of us. Live and let live. People like me aren't waging a war on Christmas - when I say \"Happy Holidays\", that INCLUDES the fucking Christians and Christmas, a religious and secular holiday, as well as Channukah, Yule, and all the other celebrations of the season. But those fucking Christian asshats try to tell me I'm trying to shut down Christianity because I don't say \"Merry Christmas\".\n\nSo, in summary: You continue to stubbornly miss the entire fucking point, and nobody gives a fuck about your reply because IT HAS NOTHING TO FUCKING DO WITH THE POST TO WHICH YOU ARE REPLYING.\n\nSo keep screaming, kiddo, and get all the downvotes you crave.",

Let's review:\n\nhttps://ieh.im/s/msedge_HdhgvtZgr5.png\n\n1. Submission calls Democrats basically Nazis\n2. Top level reply blames Twitter idiocy on poor education\n3. The right-wing nutjob agrees with Twitter that Democrats are basically like Nazis - \"he's not wrong\", i.e. Twitter dude\n4. Someone replies that no, Twitter dude is, in fact, wrong.\n5. THIS is where YOU jump in with \"The Nazi party were undoubtedly racist. Therefore not entirely wrong.\"\n\nThis has absolutely nothing to do with the discussion. They were discussing whether or not Democrats are like Nazis, and then you chime in with something that has absolutely nothing to do with the discussion.\n\nAnd it's not like you did that once. No, you've posted a dozen times in this thread \"ACSHUALLY NAZIS WERE LEFT WING ^^^at ^^^first\"\n\nLike anyone gives a shit, and like it has anything to do with the adults talking in this thread.\n\nBut it is SO FUCKING IMPORTANT to you that the NAZIS are not associated with RIGHT WING.\n\nI can only wonder why.\n\nEither you're pretending not to be right-wing, or you're pretending not to be basically a concern troll. I don't know what your game is, but posting all these times in this thread with something that has nothing to do with the thread to push a right-wing talking point?\n\nPardon me for calling you a modern fascist. That's not proven, only..... seems kinda important to you to try and associate Nazis with the left wing. Hmm.\n\nFunny, like how KKK don't tend to be Democrats, but Republicans. Not all Republicans are racists. And sure, some Democrats are racists. But it suuuuuuure seems like most of the racists tend to flock to the Republicans.\n\nAnd you suuuuurrreeee seem to find it critically important to try and claim that Nazis were left wing in a thread that really has nothing to do with Nazis, and is all about a moron spewing propaganda about Democrats.\n\nAnd that's why I've called you out for shitting up this thread with right-wing propaganda.

Krupp Steel was not owned by the state, neither was Siemens, IG Farben, BMW, Deutsche Bank, or really any other companies representing large portions of the German economy of the day. You don't have a \"socialist\" government while maintaining widespread private ownership of industry, that's a contradiction of terms. \n\nAs to public works and state control of the economy, well let's look to the United States for comparison. The US, like Germany and many other countries experiencing the great depression, turned to large public works projects and social spending. As for state control of industry, well both the US, Germany, and UK had a system of privately owned capital working under state direction in the context of a wartime economy. Unless we are suggesting Churchill and Roosevelt were also socialists for wartime production controls, this point is weak indeed. \n\nNow if you want to look at authoritarian leftist, you look at the Soviet Union. Staunchly internationalist, as opposed to nazi nationalist, with no large scale private ownership of industry, and defining its radicalism in terms of the Marxist international and multiracial class struggle against capitalists, and not a supposed ancient myth of racial supremacy. The nazis used the term \"socialist\" but not in any way that meaningfully bears a resemblance to actual socialism.",

                      "text": "I certainly agree the left-right label is pretty reductionist, but I want to address some points.\n\nYou point out that businesses in Nazi Germany, no matter how privately owned, were nevertheless subject to the whims of the Nazi state, and that this authority of the state over private industry makes Nazism sort of like \"socialism masquerading as fascism.\" But this equates authoritarianism of any form with socialism.\n\nIt is certainly true that private business was subject to Nazi control, because business owners were subject to the authority of the Nazi state like everyone else. But in the United Kingdom, and other monarchies, during the early modern era corporate charters were granted by monarch, and corporations could be dissolved at their whim. Private industry was subject to the absolute control of an authoritarian state, but I wouldn't call monarchs or monarchists \"leftists\" or \"socialists.\" The Tsar could dissolve any business he liked, but the Tsar was not left of anyone. \n\nThe defining feature of socialism is abolition of private ownership of capital and multi-national class struggle. The Nazis certainly stood for neither. And when we say \"leftism,\" we either mean Republicanism as opposed to Monarchism (in the original French usage), or Socialism or Social Democracy as opposed to Capitalism and lightly or unregulated free markets (in the modern usage). Since I can't see anything about the Nazis that made them socialist (they were not internationalist, not centered on the abolition of capitalism) and they certainly aren't about republicans, I can't see how they could be classified as \"left\" at all.\n\nAs for my comment about Churchill and Roosevelt, I mean to point out that they, like the Nazis, were not socialists. Enacting welfare policies is not a characteristic of socialism or socialist states, indeed universal healthcare in Germany dates to the time of the Kaiser, enacted in 1883 under Otto von Bismarck. Certainly a Kaiser and Bismarck are as far from socialist or leftist as you can go. Neither the Soviet Union historically, nor China today, are known for generous social welfare policies, because socialism and whether or not there is a generous welfare state or a welfare state at all have nothing to do with one another. Marx didn't write about how to administer a program of universal education or healthcare, he wrote about the abolition of capital.",

Siemens, IG Farben, BMW, Krupp Steel, Deutsche Bank, I could go on, these were all private companies that controlled large parts of the German economy under the Nazi regime. They were not state owned at all. Indeed, and IG Farben is a great example of this, many companies became earlier contributors to the Nazis for their anticommunist and anti Marxist stances. The vast majority of the economy and industry under the Nazis was owned by private individuals, capitalists, as it had been under the Weimar Republic and as it continued to be in West Germany to the present day. \n\nWhich of course is why the idea of Nazis being \"socialists\" is a bit ridiculous. Because when most people say \"socialist,\" they mean some kind of adherent to the ideas and teachings of Karl Marx, with an emphasis on multi-national (i.e. multi-racial) class solidarity and shared struggle against capitalists, and the abolition of private ownership of capital. The Soviet Union of the 1940s was socialist: no major privately owned industries there. They were authoritarian too, I'd say every bit as awful as the Nazis, but the Soviet Union was actually a socialist state while Nazi Germany was certainly a capitalist one.\n\nNow it is true that nazi Germany, like every wartime power, did exert control over wartime industry. Rationing, huge government contracting, etc. But the industries of Nazi Germany were certainly not state owned, or being run by collectivist worker councils or unions. They remained in the hands of private owners throughout the Nazi period and, in West Germany, continued to exist in private hands straight through to the modern day.",

The definition of what counts as a 'right wing' policy will differ from place to place and time to time, but the commonly accepted definition 'right wing' is that it's a school of political thought that believes in and seeks to support or enforce particular social hierarchies. For example, at the time of the French Revolution, supporting the monarchy could be seen as right wing as it seeks to preserve the aristocratic hierarchy, whereas today supporting low tax on the rich and opposing or limiting social welfare programs in the USA is a right wing policy as it perpetuates the class hierarchy (you'll note that there is no major party in the USA that is not right wing).\n\nAs such, any eugenic policy, or talk of a 'master race', is inherently right wing. Doesn't matter who holds it. Particularly relating to Nazi policies, since you asked, a famous example would the Nuremberg laws - these specifically limited the rights of Jewish people, 'gypsies', etc. essentially creating in law an underclass (a group of people lower in the hierarchy) consistent with the views of German fascism.\n\nAnother example would be Nazi Germany's pursuit of 'lebensraum' - fuelled by the belief that, as a superior people (there's that heirarchy again) - Germany had the right to settle in the lands of its neighbours.\n\nAt home, the Nazis believed that the place of women was to be homemakers and forced female professionals (think doctors, lawyers etc.) to give up their careers. You should be able to see by now why enforcing sexist divides is a right wing policy.\n\nI mean, I could go on. Turns out the Nazis were pretty right wing.",

They are as leftist as their come. \n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Socialist_Program\n\n\n10-21 and 25. Which of those do you disagree with?  How right wing are these?\n\nThe first obligation of every citizen must be to productively work mentally or physically. The activity of individual may not clash with the interests of the whole, but must proceed within the framework of the whole for the benefit for the general good. We demand therefore:\n\n\nAbolition of unearned (work and labour) incomes. Breaking of debt (interest)-slavery.\n\n\nIn consideration of the monstrous sacrifice of life and property that each war demands of the people, personal enrichment due to a war must be regarded as a crime against the nation. Therefore, we demand ruthless confiscation of all war profits.\n\n\nWe demand nationalization of all businesses which have been up to the present formed into companies (trusts).\nWe demand that the profits from wholesale trade shall be shared out.\n\n\nWe demand an expansion on a large scale of old age welfare.\n\n\nWe demand the creation of a healthy middle class and its conservation, immediate communalization of the great warehouses and their being leased at low cost to small firms, the utmost consideration of all small firms in contracts with the State, county or municipality.\nWe demand a land reform suitable to our needs, provision of a law for the free expropriation of land for the purposes of public utility, abolition of taxes on land and prevention of all speculation in land.\nWe demand struggle without consideration against those whose activity is injurious to the general interest. Common national criminals, usurers, profiteers and so forth are to be punished with death, without consideration of confession or race.\nWe demand substitution of a German common law in place of the Roman Law serving a materialistic world-order.\n\n\nThe state is to be responsible for a fundamental reconstruction of our whole national education program, to enable every capable and industrious German to obtain higher education and subsequently introduction into leading positions. The plans of instruction of all educational institutions are to conform with the experiences of practical life. The comprehension of the concept of the state must be striven for by the school [Staatsb\u00fcrgerkunde] as early as the beginning of understanding. We demand the education at the expense of the state of outstanding intellectually gifted children of poor parents without consideration of position or profession.\n\n\nThe state is to care for the elevating national health by protecting the mother and child, by outlawing child-labor, by the encouragement of physical fitness, by means of the legal establishment of a gymnastic and sport obligation, by the utmost support of all organizations concerned with the physical instruction of the young.\n\n\n\nEdit: and please realize anyone who has ever told you Nazis were left wing is either ignorant or afraid you'll realize that democrats have the same talking points as Nazis since the civil war",

So for instance a union would be a corporation in corporatism, so would activist groups and yes business leaders. \n\nCorporatism also isn't state capitalism as unions are also made part of the government.

Also Hitler even met with an [Hindu Indian Independence leader, Subhas Chandra Bose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subhas_Chandra_Bose#1941%E2%80%931943:_Nazi_Germany) to help his fight against the British.  People don't seem to realize that a large portion of the world was under British colonial rule and many people living under them saw Nazi Germany as a potential ally to help them gain independence.   \n\nThe biggest fact people who claim Nazis supported Islam seem to forget was that the vast majority of Nazi Germany including Hitler was CHRISTIAN.  Hitler was a Catholic, and I'm pretty sure the Catholic Church and Protestant Christian sect's long history of blaming the Jews for the death of Jesus shaped his antisemitic beliefs, but many anti-Muslim bigots and Islamaphobes leave that fact out because a lot of them are right wing Christians.  Also millions of Muslims served as volunteers in the British India Army fighting against the Nazis and Japan during WWII so this idea that there was a large amount of Muslims throughout the world who supported the Nazis during WWII is complete nonsense, lots of Muslims fought on behalf of the Allies as colonial subjects of the British Empire and France.",

It was them basically saying very explicitly that they were definitely *not communists*. It was also them appealing to the lower-income working class, who were also being courted by the communists. And saying they were \"nationalist\" allowed them to tie Hitler's far-right authoritarian nationalist policies to the socialist rhetoric going around at the time. \n\nEssentially, they hijacked the word \"socialist\" in order to fool people. And it worked. Still working today, too.",

They had to. They needed popular support in order to get power, and then for an army to hold onto it.\n\nIt was all very carefully planned. And again, they needed to make people believe that shit. They were so good at it, it's still working!\n\nAnd pertaining to this topic is something I'll paste from another reply I made:\n\n> You now who else liked farmers and \"the common people\"? Hermann G\u00f6ring. Here's part of an interview with him in his cell at Nuremberg, taken from Dr. G.M. Gilbert's 1976 book \"The Memory of Justice\":\n\n> G\u00f6ring: Why, of course, the people don't want war. Why would some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best that he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece? Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia nor in England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship.\n\n> Gilbert: There is one difference. In a democracy, the people have some say in the matter through their elected representatives, and in the United States only Congress can declare wars.\n\n> G\u00f6ring: Oh, that is all well and good, but, voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country.\n\n> Still sounding very familiar!\n\nThey still need dupes for their nonsense to have any legs.\n\nAdding to that, Stephen Miller was most definitely taking a couple pages out of Goebbels' (and the Nazis) playbook. The real master class part is how they were able to then turn Nazism back around on the left -- while their supporters were carrying Nazi flags and throwing Nazi salutes! \n\nI grew up with a neighbor who had a numbered tattoo on his arm. He'd occasionally come over and drink a beer and tell us stories of what the Nazis were all about. Nobody with even a gram of human compassion or decency could listen to any of that and still side with or identify as a Nazi. Hell, the lens of history ought to be enough to show any sane, compassionate person what utter monsters they were.\n\nWhat's really scary is that this stuff still works. It shouldn't, we should have grown as a species enough to where we can't be fooled again by that right-wing authoritarian schtick, but some of us haven't.",

They believe slavery and subjugation is the best economic plan.\n\n Communist is Alt Left they believe: Everyone is equal and will be treated as such regardless of their work, no one can have religion as it pulls away from humanity and everyone must aid their fellow man or they are a threat to humanity. They believe the best economic plan is a state sponsored work force that strictly controls all essential resources. \n\n Nazism is the antithesis of Communism, it was created solely to reject the very idea that everyone is equal. They are both terrible because one disregards human nature and loses humanity to quell human nature the other is purely the of human nature exaggerated in the idea that others aren't human and their mimicking of humanity is the evil in the world.",

Turkey, along with most countries of the time, was heavily nationalistic and authoritarian - ideology isn't binary.\n\nAnyhow, the Armenian Genocide wasn't even about race so it's irrelevant to the discussion of racism and its relevance to Islam. It was about eliminating a group seen as \"threats\" by the CUP dictatorship, not race. And in any case, the people who did it weren't exactly fans of Islam either.",

They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert.

In My Struggle, Hitler, writing about the time he had spent living amongst the poor and the destitute in Vienna before the First World War, had waxed indignant about the way in which social welfare had encouraged the preservation of the degenerate and the feeble. From a Social Darwinist point of view, charity and philanthropy were evils that had to be eliminated if the German race was to be strengthened and its weakest elements weeded out in the process of natural selection. The Nazi Party frequently condemned the elaborate welfare system that had grown up under the Weimar Republic as bureaucratic, cumbersome and directed essentially to the wrong ends.\n\n- Source: Richard J.

People can be perfectly respectable right wingers, and not be Nazi\u2019s. People can be perfectly respectable left wingers, and not be communists. There is such a massive difference in ideology and beliefs.",

So while they did push some socialist points early on, they later worked with business owners to purge actual socialists. Socialists and communists were amongst the first in concentration camps.\n\nThis is also why the religiousness of Nazis is hard to pin down. This is why the Nazis allied with (and sometimes later betrayed) groups that Hitler distinctively listed as \"subhuman\".

That is not likely as hate speech and propaganda had already tipped things beyond the protection of isolated acts of self defense. On the other hand, it does demonstrate the failures of gun control laws, especially against motivated people of certain demographics.",

      "text": "Some things to take into account when considering just what the \"socialist\" really means in \"National Socialist German Worker's Party\":\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe economy of Nazi Germany and privatization:\n\n>The Great Depression had spurred increased state ownership in most Western capitalist countries. This also took place in Germany during the last years of the Weimar Republic.[40] However, after the Nazis took power, industries were privatized en masse. Several banks, shipyards, railway lines, shipping lines, welfare organizations, and more were privatized.[41] The Nazi government took the stance that enterprises should be in private hands wherever possible.[42] State ownership was to be avoided unless it was absolutely necessary for rearmament or the war effort, and even in those cases \u201cthe Reich often insisted on the inclusion in the contract of an option clause according to which the private firm operating the plant was entitled to purchase it.\u201d\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Nazi_Germany#:~:text=Several%20banks%2C%20shipyards%2C%20railway%20lines,in%20private%20hands%20wherever%20possible.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHitler's own words on what the \"socialism\" in National Socialist German Worker's Party means:\n\n>Our adopted term 'Socialist' has nothing to do with Marxian Socialism. Marxism is anti-property; true socialism is not.\n\n>The ideology that dominates us is in diametrical contradiction to that of Soviet Russia. National Socialism is a doctrine that has reference exclusively to the German people. Bolshevism lays stress on international mission. We National Socialists believe a man can, in the long run, be happy only among his own people.\n\n>We National Socialists see in private property a higher level of human economic development that according to the differences in performance controls the management of what has been accomplished enabling and guaranteeing the advantage of a higher standard of living for everyone. Bolshevism destroys not only private property but also private initiative and the readiness to shoulder responsibility.\n\n>What right do these people have to demand a share of property or even in administration?... The employer who accepts the responsibility for production also gives the workpeople their means of livelihood. Our greatest industrialists are not concerned with the acquisition of wealth or with good living, but, above all else, with responsibility and power. They have worked their way to the top by their own abilities, and this proof of their capacity \u2013 a capacity only displayed by a higher race \u2013 gives them the right to lead.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHitler discussing left-wing vs right-wing and where the Nazi part sits:\n\n>There are only two possibilities in Germany; do not imagine that the people will forever go with the middle party, the party of compromises; one day it will turn to those who have most consistently foretold the coming ruin and have sought to dissociate themselves from it. And that party is either the Left: and then God help us! for it will lead us to complete destruction - to Bolshevism, or else it is a party of the Right which at the last, when the people is in utter despair, when it has lost all its spirit and has no longer any faith in anything, is determined for its part ruthlessly to seize the reins of power - that is the beginning of resistance of which I spoke a few minutes ago.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe definition of Fascism:\n\n>Fascism (/\u02c8f\u00e6\u0283\u026az\u0259m/) is a form of far-right, authoritarian ultranationalism[1] characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition, and strong regimentation of society and of the economy,[2] which came to prominence in early 20th-century Europe.[3] The first fascist movements emerged in Italy during World War I, before spreading to other European countries.[3] Opposed to anarchism, democracy, liberalism, and Marxism, fascism is placed on the far right-wing within the traditional left\u2013right spectrum.[3][4]\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism",

      "text": "Actually Nazis were not fans of religion. With Hitler having the banishment of the gym being one of his long-term goals. He had already banned some religions and had hope to expand the ban as he progressed through the war. This was due in large part to his disdain for Catholicism however he had such low support from that group already that he didn't want to risk completely alienating them and turning Italy against him by opening with that. Though he did ban Judaism and Jehovah's Witness\n\nFunfacts: It's common to claim that Hitler was Christian, and claimed the Nazis were a Uniquely Christian Movement... The truth is Hitler was a problem child in the Catholic Church and left it shortly after being confirmed. Hitler gave some lip service to the Church as part of his \"Have to keep the Italians on my side\", ruse, but a ban on religious belief was always a big part of his end game.\n\nIt's also common to depict Hitler as an occultist or in the New Age Movement, this is also inaccurate and I mostly blame Hollywood for it.\n\nHans Himmler was a big believer in the supernatural and would often devote Nazi resources to uncovering Atlantis or the Holy Grail or whatever he was obsessed with that week, Himmler claiming to be the reincarnation of an Atlantian God. \n\nHitler despised Himmler for this, believing these paranormal pursuits to be a waste of resources (and they were, as they turned up nothing) and asked him several times to stop, but due to Himmler's position and the amount of people who were loyal to Himmler, did not believe kicking him out the army would go very well.\n\nThe big reason why people believe Hitler was into the Occult? Well the Supernatural is a good storyline for fiction, and Nazis are great villains for fiction, being the most unquestionably evil faction in World History.\n\nSo it was common for Hollywood to do movies where the Nazis would pursue some kind of Magical Artifact for the furher, in order to win World War 2. (The Hellboy Franchise used this storyline, and so did Indiana Jones. This is also the plot to the first Bloodrayne Game and the Third Bloodrayne movie)\n\nBecause Executives are worried that audiences are stupid, and won't know who Himmler is, many of these stories wave their hands and try to say it was Hitler who wanted these things. But to be fair, I think anyone who watches Indiana Jones when they're trying to study for a WW2 Quiz gets what they deserve...\n\n (Though credit for the Bloodrayne Video Game as in that one it is a Himmler-Backed side faction called the Geigengeist Group that mistakes the demon Belial (spelt Beliar for some reason) for an Atlantian God and has an operative named Jorgen Wulfe try to bring him back by collecting parts of his body which are scattered all throughout.... Germany and Lousiana... why those two places specifcally I don't know)",

The international outlook of German business, on the other hand, was far more \u2018liberal\u2019 in flavour. Though German industry was by no means averse to tariffs, the Reich industrial association strongly favoured a system of uninhibited capital movement and multilateralism underpinned by Most Favoured Nation principles.\"\n\n- Adam Tooze, \"Wages of Destruction\"",

That in turn can be viewed as a piece of indirect evidence for the fact that the economies Germany and the Western Allies still were quite similar, as they all were basically capitalist. \n\n>The foregoing analysis again proves that in the Nazi period enterprises continued to shape their actions according to their expectations and that the state authorities not only tolerated this behavior, but bowed to it by adapting their contract offers to the wishes of industry.\n\n> That is also confirmed by Tooze, who argues that there was no 'Stalinist option' available to the Nazi regime and consequently 'a mixture of incentives provided by the state with private economic motives' was decisive for the development of certain sectors of production.\n\nSource: http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/files/capitalisback/CountryData/Germany/Other/Pre1950Series/RefsHistoricalGermanAccounts/BuchheimScherner06.pdf",

They don\u2019t even listen to or care about what the Priest says. \n\nThey are not homophobic or racist or any of that.  If someone said to my Dad, \u201cJesus said\u2026\u201d.

Socialism is indeed a complex economic and political ideology, with many branching groups who wish to implement it in many different economic and political ways yet they all share the core tenant of state control over the economy; which is why that is specifically stated in most definitions of socialism.",

It\u2019s an inevitability, like self-isolating idealisms which engage you through peer pressure, sunk cost fallacies, and vague fears of the unknown and what comforts and pains the future holds for us.\n\nBut I truly, truly believe, that if you scream enough into the void, you just might save this country with your superior historical knowledge and bold counterculture perspective on socialism. Kid, you might just have what it takes.",

It incorporates fervent antisemitism, anti-communism, scientific racism, and the use of eugenics into its creed. Its extreme nationalism originated in pan-Germanism and the ethno-nationalist neopagan V\u00f6lkisch movement which had been a prominent aspect of German nationalism since the late 19th century, and it was strongly influenced by the Freikorps paramilitary groups that emerged after Germany's defeat in World War I, from which came the party's underlying \"cult of violence\".[6] Nazism subscribed to pseudo-scientific theories of a racial hierarchy[7] and social Darwinism, identifying the Germans as a part of what the Nazis regarded as an Aryan or Nordic master race.[8] It aimed to overcome social divisions and create a homogeneous German society based on racial purity which represented a people's community (Volksgemeinschaft). The Nazis aimed to unite all Germans living in historically German territory, as well as gain additional lands for German expansion under the doctrine of Lebensraum and exclude those who they deemed either Community Aliens or \"inferior\" races.*",

The international outlook of German business, on the other hand, was far more \u2018liberal\u2019 in flavour. Though German industry was by no means averse to tariffs, the Reich industrial association strongly favoured a system of uninhibited capital movement and multilateralism underpinned by Most Favoured Nation principles.\" \n\n- Adam Tooze \"The Wages of Destruction: The Making and Breaking of the Nazi Economy\"\n\n\nNazis weren't left-wing either. They were inspired by Prussian socialism, which is entirely a right-wing idea. Historian Ishay Landa explains why they did so:\n\n\n>Juxtaposing the two elements of Spengler\u2019s worldview, a market economy geared towards national greatness, we get a political combination which should objectively be termed \u201cnational capitalism,\u201d or, maybe, \u201cPrussian imperialism.\u201d\n\n>Socialism in any meaningful sense just does not come into it at all. In fact, socialism is precisely that which is expurgated at both levels: at the economic sphere since it impedes growth, and at the \u201cgreat\u201d political sphere since it posits peaceful international coexistence, which would make impossible the Spenglerian endorsement of imperialism.\n\n>Socialism is but the traitor that must be driven out of the fortress. We can now understand why Spengler himself, in his later years, explicitly took the air out of his former \u201csocialism\u201d: \u201cHere a great education is necessary, which I have called Prussian and small politics might be called \u2018socialistic\u2019\u2014what do words matter!\u201d (210).\n\n>But why did Spengler, being for all practical purposes a capitalist, use the term socialism in the first place? Why couldn\u2019t he have just brandished a project of \u201cPrussian Imperialism,\u201d which would have represented his views infinitely better than the banner of \u201cPrussian Socialism\u201d? It is not difficult to guess the answer, unless one is straightjacketed by an approach that construes fascists as forthright. Capitalism had scarce little popular appeal after the First World War and amidst protracted world economic crisis. A much better prospect for supporters of capitalism lay in feigning to embrace socialism, so as to infiltrate it inside an ideological and political Trojan horse and defeat it from within.\"\n\n\n- \"Sorceror's Apprentice\", Ishay Landa, 2010, pages 69-70",

                  "text": "Let's examine whether or not they were \"left-wing\"\n\n>On Monday, 20 February 1933, at 6.00 p.m., a group of about twenty-five businessmen were summoned to attend a private meeting in the villa of Hermann Goering, now acting as president of the Reichstag, at which Hitler, the Reich Chancellor, was to \u2018explain his policies\u2019.\n\n>The guests were an oddly assorted bunch. The invitees included leaders of German industry, men such as Georg von Schnitzler, second in command at IG Farben, Krupp von Bohlen, who was both head-by-marriage of the Krupp empire and the current chairman of the Reich industrial association, and Dr Albert Voegler the CEO of the Vereinigte Stahlwerke, the world\u2019s second largest steel firm. But there were also a number of decidedly second-tier figures on the list. The businessmen were greeted first by Goering and Hjalmar Schacht. Hitler himself appeared only after a considerable wait.\n\n>If the businessmen had expected a discussion of the specifics of economic policy they were to be disappointed. Hitler instead launched into a general survey of the political situation. As in his national address on 1 February, his central theme was the turning point in German history marked by the defeat and revolution of 1918. The experience of the last fourteen years had shown that \u2018private enterprise cannot be maintained in the age of democracy\u2019. Business was founded above all on the principles of personality and individual leadership. Democracy and liberalism led inevitably to Social Democracy and Communism. After fourteen years of degeneration, the moment had now come to resolve the fatal divisions within the German body politic. Hitler would show no mercy towards his enemies on the left. It was time \u2018to crush the other side completely\u2019.\n\n>The next phase in the struggle would begin after the elections of 5 March. If the Nazis were able to gain another 33 seats in the Reichstag, then the actions against the Communists would be covered by \u2018constitutional means\u2019. But, \u2018regardless of the outcome there will be no retreat . . . if the election does not decide . . . the decision must be brought about even by other means\u2019.\n\n>Hitler did not take questions from his audience, nor did he spell out exactly what was expected of the business leaders. Hitler had not come to negotiate. He had come to inform them of his intentions. And his audience can have been left in no doubt. Germany\u2019s new Chancellor planned to put an end to parliamentary democracy. He planned to crush the German left and in the process he was more than willing to use physical force. At least according to the surviving record, the conflict between left and right was the central theme of the speeches by both Hitler and Goering on 20 February. There was no mention either of anti-Jewish policy or a campaign of foreign conquest.\n\n>Hitler left it to Goering to reveal the immediate purpose of the meeting. Since German business had a major stake in the struggle against the left, it should make an appropriate financial contribution. \u2018The sacrifice[s]\u2019, Goering pointed out, \u2018would be so much easier . . . to bear if it [industry] realized that the election of 5 March will surely be the last one for the next ten years, probably even for the next hundred years.\u2019 Krupp von Bohlen, the designated spokesman for the business side, had prepared extensive notes for a detailed discussion of economic policy, but confronted with this bald appeal, he thought better of introducing tedious details. Instead, he confined himself to stating that all present would surely agree on the need for the speediest possible resolution of the political situation. Business fully supported the goal of establishing a government in the interests of the German people.\n\n>Only under a strong and independent state could the economy and business \u2018develop and flourish\u2019. After this exchange of nationalist platitudes, Hitler and Goering departed and Hjalmar Schacht got down to business.\n\n>He proposed an election fund of 3 million Reichsmarks, to be shared between the Nazis and their nationalist coalition partners. Over the following three weeks Schacht received contributions from seventeen different business groups. The largest individual donations came from IG Farben (400,000 Reichsmarks) and the Deutsche Bank (200,000 Reichsmarks). The association of the mining industry also made a generous deposit of 400,000 Reichsmarks. Other large donors included the organizers of the Berlin Automobile Exhibition (100,000 Reichsmarks) and a cluster of electrical engineering corporations including Telefunken, AEG and the Accumu-latoren Fabrik. In the years that followed, the Adolf Hitler Spende was to become institutionalized as a regular contribution to the maintenance of Hitler\u2019s personal expenses.\n\n>In practical terms, however, it was the donations in February and March 1933 that really made the difference. They provided a large cash injection at a moment when the party was severely short of funds and faced, as Goering had predicted, the last competitive election in its history.\n\n- Source: Adam Tooze, \"Wages of Destruction\"",

In the short term it may have seemed like an economic miracle, but in reality Germany would've collapsed under it's own weight. \n\nThey provided jobs for many unemployed men by taking away those same jobs from women and minorities. Their early success in the war helped to keep them going, but an economy largely based on looting conquered lands isn't sustainable.\n\n>Also I appreciate you being civil and not responding emotionally like the other crackpots on here\n\nNot a problem. It's easy to get frustrated on topics like this - which I definitely do more often than I should. I suppose just seeing a thousand different comments talking about the name of the party is quite annoying.",

It incorporates fervent antisemitism, anti-communism, scientific racism, and the use of eugenics into its creed. Its extreme nationalism originated in pan-Germanism and the ethno-nationalist neopagan V\u00f6lkisch movement which had been a prominent aspect of German nationalism since the late 19th century, and it was strongly influenced by the Freikorps paramilitary groups that emerged after Germany's defeat in World War I, from which came the party's underlying \"cult of violence\".[6] Nazism subscribed to pseudo-scientific theories of a racial hierarchy[7] and social Darwinism, identifying the Germans as a part of what the Nazis regarded as an Aryan or Nordic master race.[8] It aimed to overcome social divisions and create a homogeneous German society based on racial purity which represented a people's community (Volksgemeinschaft). The Nazis aimed to unite all Germans living in historically German territory, as well as gain additional lands for German expansion under the doctrine of Lebensraum and exclude those who they deemed either Community Aliens or \"inferior\" races.*",

Marxism is anti-property; true socialism is not.\n\n> The ideology that dominates us is in diametrical contradiction to that of Soviet Russia. National Socialism is a doctrine that has reference exclusively to the German people. Bolshevism lays stress on international mission. We National Socialists believe a man can, in the long run, be happy only among his own people.\n\n> We National Socialists see in private property a higher level of human economic development that according to the differences in performance controls the management of what has been accomplished enabling and guaranteeing the advantage of a higher standard of living for everyone. Bolshevism destroys not only private property but also private initiative and the readiness to shoulder responsibility.\n\n> What right do these people have to demand a share of property or even in administration?... The employer who accepts the responsibility for production also gives the workpeople their means of livelihood. Our greatest industrialists are not concerned with the acquisition of wealth or with good living, but, above all else, with responsibility and power. They have worked their way to the top by their own abilities, and this proof of their capacity \u2013 a capacity only displayed by a higher race \u2013 gives them the right to lead.\n\nHitler's own words disparaging the left and aligning the NAZI party as right wing:\n\n> There are only two possibilities in Germany; do not imagine that the people will forever go with the middle party, the party of compromises; one day it will turn to those who have most consistently foretold the coming ruin and have sought to dissociate themselves from it. And that party is either the Left: and then God help us! for it will lead us to complete destruction - to Bolshevism, or else it is a party of the Right which at the last, when the people is in utter despair, when it has lost all its spirit and has no longer any faith in anything, is determined for its part ruthlessly to seize the reins of power - that is the beginning of resistance of which I spoke a few minutes ago.\n\nAll of this is easily found with a simple google search, yet here you are repeating false talking points without any fact checking, outing yourself as the mouth-breathing puppet you are. Fucking shameful.",

So only after disassociating himself from neo-Nazi ideology (though clearly only facetiously) was he able to convince a majority of people to vote for him. The article goes on to say:\n\n>  He continued to run for public office through 2016; however, following his reversion to open neo-Nazism, **his candidacies were not competitive.**\n\nIronically, the case of David Duke pointedly *disproves* your assertion that white supremacy and neo-Nazism are mainstream strains of conservative ideology. It would be easier to use your logic to claim that Marxism or Communism were mainstream on the left (which they aren\u2019t).

Northern Europe is pretty far left. (especially compared to the US) but they are very capitalist. \n\nIn fact the axis, pre-dates socialism. The first international was in 1864, the French revolution was in 1793. Directly after the French revolution was the first time left/right was used in application to politics. So, no. Your assumption about the axis is very wrong.",

Collectivism over Individualism.\n\nInteresting, so when Hitler said people shouldn't expect handouts from capitalists:\n\n> What right do these people have to demand a share of property or even in administration?... The employer who accepts the responsibility for production also gives the workpeople their means of livelihood. Our greatest industrialists are not concerned with the acquisition of wealth or with good living, but, above all else, with responsibility and power. They have worked their way to the top by their own abilities, and this proof of their capacity \u2013 a capacity only displayed by a higher race \u2013 gives them the right to lead.\n\nHe was actually speaking of collectivism?\n\nWhen Hitler repeatedly stated their form of socialism was about race and was not Marxism or econimc socialism, again, he was speaking about collectivism?\n\n> The ideology that dominates us is in diametrical contradiction to that of Soviet Russia. National Socialism is a doctrine that has reference exclusively to the German people. Bolshevism lays stress on international mission. We National Socialists believe a man can, in the long run, be happy only among his own people.\n\n> We National Socialists see in private property a higher level of human economic development that according to the differences in performance controls the management of what has been accomplished enabling and guaranteeing the advantage of a higher standard of living for everyone. Bolshevism destroys not only private property but also private initiative and the readiness to shoulder responsibility.\n\nWas it left wing when the Nazi party privatized everything they could as quickly as possible?\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Nazi_Germany#:~:text=Several%20banks%2C%20shipyards%2C%20railway%20lines,in%20private%20hands%20wherever%20possible.\n\nIf you're going to refer to your post as a TED talk, why don't you include some actual information instead of just some vague, irrelevant opinion. You state that nationalism is neither a left wing nor right wing ideology (incorrect) and then use that as your evidence that Nazi Germany was indeed left wing (it's literally your only tie in to the Soviets and China). If that's your best effort, don't waste other people's time, it's disrespectful and makes you look like an idiot.",

For fun, here are a couple:\n\n>The ideology that dominates us is in diametrical contradiction to that of Soviet Russia. National Socialism is a doctrine that has reference exclusively to the German people. Bolshevism lays stress on international mission. We National Socialists believe a man can, in the long run, be happy only among his own people.\n\n>We National Socialists see in private property a higher level of human economic development that according to the differences in performance controls the management of what has been accomplished enabling and guaranteeing the advantage of a higher standard of living for everyone. Bolshevism destroys not only private property but also private initiative and the readiness to shoulder responsibility.\n\n>What right do these people have to demand a share of property or even in administration?... The employer who accepts the responsibility for production also gives the workpeople their means of livelihood. Our greatest industrialists are not concerned with the acquisition of wealth or with good living, but, above all else, with responsibility and power. They have worked their way to the top by their own abilities, and this proof of their capacity \u2013 a capacity only displayed by a higher race \u2013 gives them the right to lead.",

Why did the state do as he said, even when that was causing them to lose the war? Why did the state completely fall apart when he killed himself?",

If the state was owned privately then it would still be capitalism. Some people have given this type of government its own name. \n\nThe Nazi's were zero percent socialist because they were not a democracy. Socialism is described by democratically controlled means of production. Which can be understand as the level of democracy involved in economic decisions. Economic decisions were made by private business owners and a totalitarian state. This combination pushes it as far away from anything resembling socialism as possible. The US is far more socialist because democracy does play a role in economic decision making. \n\nChina most certainly is not left leaning in any sense. They use leftist ideals as propaganda. They push their brutal policies as being for the collective good when they often times are not. In the same way the US uses the ideals of individual freedom to push policies that continue to enrich the ruling class. \n\nClassifying economies and governments is very nuanced and your lack of nuanced understanding is very clear.",

Americans incorrectly tie gun rights, abortion, gay marriage into the spectrum, when they don't really fit there.  The issue is Americans don't really understand the left vs right thing, and use the terms incorrectly.\n\n>The Nazis had little freedom for corporations as the entire countries workforce was put into manufacturing for the war....socially conservative and as authoritarian as they could possibly be\n\nyes, but thats still right wing.  Socialism requires these corporations to be run by the people, that's the whole point.  Right-wing isn't the absence of authority, or a ruling class over the corporations.\n\nThe fact that you have a ruling class, even one that dictates the rules to corporations , is a sign of a right wing government, not a socialist one.  The Nazi's specifically ran their companies and industry like Cartels, which again, is a right wing phenomenon.  Hitler had no desire to manage the industries, as long as they were producing what he needed for the war effort, and they remained largely under private ownership.\n\nThis isn't really a debate, or a question in academia, the Nazis were a *known* far right government.  Again, its only an issue for modern Americans who try to gaslight the past.",

He only relented when the depression kicked in, at which point he centralized all welfare so that he could exclude all Jews, non-Germans, political opponents, and anyone they considered inferior. So, you know, the exact opposite of the classes social welfare net proposed by socialists. As you said, socialism is not just when the government does stuff, no?\n\nThat being said, you seem to be arguing with yourself and making up what you think I am going to say, so I'll step aside and let you argue with yourself.\n\nGood luck finding that dream strawman.",

It was actually from a professional historian that I got my hands on the proper sources for this topic. I skimmed thru the arguments you put forward by the \"professional\" reddit historians and many of them are saying there's no way that Nazism was true socialism because they despised the Soviets! That's a pretty funny argument bc they are basically saying that Soviet bolshevism was the one true form of socialism and are ignoring the fact that socialism is a broad ideology that encompasses much more than just Marxist socialism.

These are all lies. There is no utopia. Socialism is a vessel to authoritarianism. Hitler attempted to implement social reforms that would benefit the German people. Stalin attempted to implement social reforms to benefit the peasants and \"workers.\" They failed. All it led to was famine, war, slavery, mass death and exploitation. Because socialism doesn't work.

I will attempt to expand further on that idea below,\n\nThe definition of socialism is \"a political and economic theory of social organization which advocates that the means of production, distribution, and exchange should be owned or regulated by the community as a whole.\" \n\nNow, the different types of socialism have slightly different definitions but it usually boils down to the same thing: Group/Collective control of the economy. The group/collective can be different based upon which branch of socialism we are discussing. The Marxist branch speaks of the \"worker.\" The Fascist branch speaks of the \"National\" (Citizen of a particular ethnic nation-state). The National socialist branch speaks of the race, particularly the German race in the case of Nazi Germany. There are obviously many other types of socialism but we will keep it to these bc they are within the scope of our discussion. \n\nThe Soviet Union (which followed the Marxist Socialist model) destroyed individual workers unions and created one national union under the communist party banner. Nazi Germany destroyed individual workers unions and created one national union for the German people under the Nazi party banner, of whom would receive benefits from being a part of the collective national workers union. The same was done in Fascist Italy. \n\nEach of these states attempted to bring their respective groups (or collectives) shared benefits. These benefits, however, come at a cost as nothing is free. The Soviets attempted to realize these ambitions by exploiting and robbing the \"kulaks.\" The Nazis attempted to bring benefits to their collective by robbing, enslaving and exploiting Jews, Slavs and others. The Fascists attempted to bring fourth their utopia by conquering \"lesser\" nation-states and exploiting their resources (Imperialism, Italian conquest of Ethiopia).  \n\nMy point in laying this out is to show the clear ideological similarities between Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy and Marxist Soviet Union bc it is undisputed that the Soviet Union was a socialist state. I hope you can acknowledge these clear similarities and not dance over/ignore them as they are very important similarities. \n\nYou say that corporations are anti-socialist. My argument is that the collective investors of a corporation seek to benefit off of the exploitive labor of those in our society seen as \"blue collar\" or uneducated and unskilled. How is this (ideologically, not practically) different from the Marxist model of exploiting the kulaks for the collective benefit of the worker? How is it different (again, ideologically) from the Nazi exploitation of Jews and Slavs for the benefit of their racial collective? It is practically different, but ideologically the same. You seem to be having an issue with the different groups I am referencing as you keep referring back to the \"workers\" ownership of the means of production. But what you are missing is that your type of socialism is just one type of socialism. Referencing the definition I laid out before it is clear that socialism, broadly, seeks to elevate a certain group but the group doesn't have to be the \"worker\" as you keep mentioning. It can be a Nationality, and Ethnicity, a gender, a social/economic class, or a race among many other ways you could group people. \n\nCorrect me if I am wrong, but I would assume that you are an advocate for the \"worker\" (bc you have mentioned this many times in your definition of socialism) which more closely mirrors Marxist socialist theory.\n\nI've already typed way too much and I don't really want to continue such a deep discussion in a reddit thread so if you want to keep discussing it you can DM me. \n\nIf not, then I will leave it with this; good books on the topic of the Nazi economy are \"The vampire economy\" \"Soviet and Nazi economic planning in the 1930s\" and \"the wages of destruction.\"\n\nThey describe the ways the Nazis nationalized key industries, confiscated private property and redistributed it to the German people/Race, robbed and exploited members of other races to serve the German race. All of these are clear socialist actions. You can choose to believe the quotes of Hitler himself all you want, but he and people like him will say whatever they need to say in order to obtain power. If you read his book you will see that he was very against capitalism as he saw capitalism as \"Jewish Finance\" and that he was against Marxism because he saw it as a \"Jewish\" ideology. His anti-Semitism was his socialism. To deny that he was a socialist is almost akin to denying his anti-Semitism. \n\nThis was a great discussion and I hope we can continue it in the DMs or elsewhere because you seem to know a lot about the topic and I think we could learn a lot from each other.",

The key feature of socialism as defined by most respected historians and political analysts (see, I can do it too lol) is collective/group ownership of the economy.

You are only attempting to quote and counter about half of what I am saying which tells me that you have no counter for a lot of my arguments and the counters you do decide to put forward are quite weak as well. \n\nI'm also questioning whether you read your own sources.

They seized **economic** and military leadership? This is from your own source. \n\nWow, turns out a lot of respected historians and political scientists agree with me! \n\nMore quotes from your source, \n\n*\"For it definitely cannot be argued that there existed a kind of quasi-socialization with private firm property only preserved nominally.\"*\n\n*\"...the state tried to induce firms to act according to its aims by offering them a number of contract options to choose from.\"*\n\n*\"...the production of an increasing selection of goods was quantitatively restricted or even forbidden, a tendency greatly intensified during the war.\"*\n\n*\"...the regime also established a system of incentives consisting of extra rations of scarce raw materials allotted to firms that undertook to manufacture textiles for high priority requirement.\"*\n\n*\"Thus, the German textiles industry of the Nazi period certainly did not work in an institutional setting of liberal markets.\"*\n\nHow can you read that and think \"Sounds like free market capitalism to me!\"?\n\nThis is pretty funny, I was expecting to read a source that disagreed with me but it agrees with a lot of my claims lol.",

That is **grounded in my ideology**. If they didn't view private property as a human right then it reflects that their **ideology** doesn't view property as a human right and is therefore **closer to socialism** than it is to capitalism.

I'm becoming more and more convinced that you're just a Marxist troll...\n\n>So as I stated before and as this paper stated in much detail, they offered incentives but still left private property owners much autonomy and freedom to act as they chose.\n\nThe Nazis exercised control over **key industries**, such as the steel industry, synthetic fuel industry, textile industry and other **raw and manufactured resources**. If a small company wanted to produce a certain product that contained raw or manufactured resources (which would basically be all companies) then they would have to go through these **state controlled**, **nationalized** companies to obtain said resources. For the state to **offer incentives** or set **price controls** (as the Nazis did, admitted in your own sources) is the state exercising its power over the \"private\" companies. This is **akin** to what **modern socialists** advocate for. \n\n>The very next sentence\u2026 \u201cBut neither was it one of complete state direction and central planning. Private ownership of firms still had eco-nomic significance, because entrepreneurs preserved a good deal of their autonomy with regard to the profile of their production until after the outbreakof war.\u201d So they weren\u2019t controlled by the state and still kept significant autonomy as a private entity.\n\nAutonomy at the **price** of **compliance** with the **states mandate**, as admitted by your own source. What do you think happened to companies, newspapers, media companies that published or supported anti-nazi sentiments? Do you honestly think they were allowed to keep their autonomy? Obviously not. An authoritarian socialist regime crushes opposition, that's the only way they can survive. \n\n>You can\u2019t just take a load of quotes completely out of context or misunderstand their meaning and then pretend the source agrees with you when the whole point of the paper is to argue that private companies retained significant autonomy and freedom in Nazi Germany.\n\nYour source clearly indicated that Nazi Germany was nowhere near capitalism. That is more in line with my argument than yours. \n\n>I never said it was free market capitalism\n\nWe can definitely agree on this, and I would argue (and my sources also argue, but you don't want to read them bc they hurt your widdle marxist feewings) that Nazism is much closer to Marxism than capitalism.

If they didn't view private property as a human right then it reflects that their ideology doesn't view property as a human right and is therefore closer to socialism than it is to capitalism.\n\nI don\u2019t view ice cream as a human right but that doesn\u2019t mean I oppose it\u2019s existence and want to work towards abolishing it. Just as Nazis may not view private property as a human right but it\u2019s clear in their actions that they did not oppose it, in fact they increased it.\n\n> They are saying that it cannot be disputed that there existed a quasi-socialization. I'm becoming more and more convinced that you're just a Marxist troll...\n\n\"For it definitely cannot be argued that there existed a kind of quasi-socialization.\" Fuck this is difficult, they are saying that you cannot argue that quasi-socialisation existed, that is the entire point of the paper. It goes directly against your point, do you just lack any kind of reading comprehension?\n\n> This is akin to what modern socialists advocate for.\n\nWhich modern socialists? Are you talking about those like Bernie or AoC because they advocate social democracy and not socialism.\n\n> Autonomy at the price of compliance with the states mandate\n\nExcept as the source points out companies could and did go against the states mandate, and they give example of companies that denied government requests.\n\n> Your source clearly indicated that Nazi Germany was nowhere near capitalism. That is more in line with my argument than yours.\n\nYour argument was that companies were only private in name and were actually under state control. My source directly opposes that view and you\u2019d know if you didn\u2019t just cherry pick the quotes that make you seem right.\n\n> my sources also argue, but you don't want to read them bc they hurt your widdle marxist feewings\n\nNever said I was a Marxist so don\u2019t put words in my mouth, although I do understand you lack reading comprehension so I understand your mistake. Also as I mentioned your source didn\u2019t hurt my feelings it\u2019s just inaccurate and makes many falsehoods. If you want to believe corporations are socialist then fine go ahead but be aware that no actual socialists share your view, and it makes you look stupid to repeatedly argue something you clearly don\u2019t understand.",

Antifa is a proud advocate for being against racism, bigotry, and hate speech. Instead of freely listening to people, making up your mind, and forming your own opinions, they actively shut down speech or any discourse. Antifa thinks that all conservatives or anyone who possess right leaning views is either a fascist or a Nazi. Not only is it a dangerous ideology, but a dangerous mindset on the world too. Republicans look at liberals and left leaning views the same way. Calling all Liberals Communist and all Conservatives Nazis is far from the truth.

The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert.

The reasons you hate someone become the same reasons nazis were evil, it's WHY you hate who you hate and why everyone hates the nazis! This happens in every direction, and maybe I'm a little more sensitive to the rampant abuse of \"nazi\" because I inherited a Star of David that was hidden by my great grandfather while he survived through Dachau. Why were nazis evil? Because they waged needless war that cost millions of lives and attempted to exterminate an entire race of people, with a terrifying efficiency that was pretty damn close to succeeding, all under the banner of \"genetic superiority.\" You know what wouldn't be a mark against nazis? Supporting public education. Nazis also breathed air, doesn't automatically make breathing air evil. \n\nThe only lesson I see that can be salvaged from WWII is that shrugging off mass human suffering as \"not my problem, doesn't involve me, wouldn't matter if I cared either way\" simply isn't good enough. It's true no matter what level of resolution we choose: it's true in the macro, from neighborhoods up to nations and the global community, especially as we're facing a global warming crisis on the heals of realizing that an alarming percentage will choose to confront and deny demonstrable and repeatable science if it poses a slight inconvenience. And I would argue it's even more important at the micro/individual level. If you honestly want a decent world to live in and expect it, you must be willing to pitch in to maintain its decency. Pick up trash, help people for the sake of helping them, be considerate, understanding and forgiving. Treat people with a baseline of respect and decency that expands your community. Or in short: don't be a dick. Because we're not ever THAT far from our arboreal roots, the war of all against all, and **no one** is THAT safe from mass chaos.",

Our American concept of right wing is based on conserving a certain set of dogmatic puritan values.\n\nA conservative in Europe at the time was pretty left leaning in comparison. People lived in dense cities with lots of rules, there was a rising labor class, and \"liberal\" was thinking they were equals some how, even though their hands were dirty.\n\nWhen the national socialist party came along, public health, promotion of the worker as the engine of society, and economic reform were the first issues dealt with. In the American system, these sound like labor democrats.\n\nBut there was messaging from the government about how a German looks and speaks and dresses. In a Europe escaping monarchies, this doesn't seem that weird. But to an American these ideas are so right winged that they're unconscionable to our most conservative.\n\nConservative and liberal are relative to the values being conserved or changed. Right and left are labels defining the policies surrounding these abstractions.\n\nIn conclusion, does not compute.",

              "text": ">The Nazis' rigorous enforcement of section 218 followed logically from the high regard they had for motherhood. In the first five years of the regime, convictions under section 218 increased by 50%, while birth control centers were shut down and access to contraception was curtailed. During World War II, the Nazis called for the death penalty for repeat offenders against section 218. While the Nazis imposed a very strict anti-abortion scheme for healthy 'Aryans,' they allowed and encouraged abortion if either of the parents was believed to carry hereditary defects. The Nazis further undermined family planning by strictly enforcing existing prohibitions on the display and advertising of contraception. On May 26, 1933, the Nazis re-introduced the prohibitions on publicity or education regarding abortion or abortifacients that had been abolished during the Weimar Republic. Doctors were understandably anxious about referring patients for therapeutic abortions in such circumstances, and the number of referrals declined from about 44,000 in 1932 to 4,131 in 1937.\n\n\n- Source: \"Abortion and Women's Legal Personhood in Germany: A Contribution to the Feminist Theory of State\", by D.A. Jeremy Telman\n\n\n\nVery familiar.\n\n\n>Cutting back on welfare payments was only part of a wider strategy. Urging the German people to engage in self-help instead of relying on payouts from the state carried with it the implication that those who could not help themselves were dispensable, indeed a positive threat to the future health of the German people. The racially unsound, deviants, criminals, the \u2018asocial\u2019 and the like were to be excluded from the welfare system altogether. As we have seen, by 1937-8 members of the underclass, social deviants and petty criminals were being arrested in large numbers and put into concentration camps since they were regarded by the Nazis as being of no use to the regime. In the end, therefore, as soon as rearmament had soaked up the mass of the unemployed, the Nazis\u2019 original scepticism about the benefits of social welfare reasserted itself in the most brutal possible way.\n\n- Source: The Third Reich in Power, Richard J.

(And if you want to be ultra-cynical, if fewer women are on the pill \u2014 According to a 2017 Kaiser Family Foundation survey one in five sexually active women ages 18-44 aren\u2019t on any birth control \u2014 then that means more abortion business for Planned Parenthood, which is, as Manning notes, America\u2019s \"number one abortion provider.\"\n\nBut why wouldn\u2019t the honest, socially progressive Democrats want it? \n\nPlanned Parenthood is also a big donor to Democrats, who have worked to block over-the-counter birth control pills. And Democrats have fought hard, partly because they \u2014 and drug companies \u2014 want birth control pills to be subject to health insurance reimbursement, though only the more privileged among Americans get that. \n\nhttps://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/reason.com/2019/01/16/deregulate-the-pill/%3famp\n\nhttps://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/amp.usatoday.com/amp/1402941001\n\nThe \u2018welfare system\u2019 is such a broad topic that I don\u2019t even know where to begin.

It had to allow Strasser, Goebbels and the crank Feder to beguile the masses with the cry that the National Socialists were truly \u201csocialists\u201d and against the money barons. On the other hand, money to keep the party going had to be wheedled out of those who had an ample supply of it. Throughout the latter half of 1931, says Dietrich, Hitler \u201ctraversed Germany from end to end, holding private interviews with prominent [business] personalities.\u201d So hush-hush were some of these meetings that they had to be held \u201cin some lonely forest glade. Privacy,\u201d explains Dietrich, \u201cwas absolutely imperative; the press must have no chance of doing mischief. Success was the consequence.\u201d  \n\n>So was an almost comical zigzag in Nazi politics. Once in the fall of 1930 Strasser, Feder and Frick introduced a bill in the Reichstag on behalf of the Nazi Party calling for a ceiling of 4 per cent on all interest rates, the expropriation of the holdings of \u201cthe bank and stock exchange magnates\u201d and of all \u201cEastern Jews\u201d without compensation, and the nationalization of the big banks. Hitler was horrified; this was not only Bolshevism, it was financial suicide for the party. He peremptorily ordered the party to withdraw the measure. Thereupon the Communists reintroduced it, word for word. Hitler bade his party vote against it.\" \n\n- William L. Shirer, \"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\"",

The 'idea' itself was Socialism. Here Hitler interrupted Strasser by declaring that this so-called Socialism was nothing but pure Marxism. There was no such thing as a capitalist system. A factory-owner was depended upon his workmen. If they went on strike, then his so-called property became utterly worthless. At this point Hitler turned to his neighbour Amann and said: 'What right have these people to demand a share in property or even in the administration? Herr Amann, would you permit your typist to have any voice in your affairs? The employer who accepts the responsibility for production also gives the workpeople their means of livelihood. Our greatest industrialists are not concerned with the acquisition of wealth or with good living, but, above all else, with responsibility and power. They have worked their way to the top by their own abilities, and this proof of their capacity -- a capacity only displayed by a higher race--gives them the right to lead.\n\nNo wonder why so many industrialists funded the Nazi Party. No wonder why so many industrialists were convicted for their role in the Nazi regime, the fact that they profited from the use of slave labor and from the Holocaust (Nuremberg Trials - IG Farben, Krupp and Flick trials).",

Hierarchy and inequality may be seen as natural results of traditional social differences or competition in market economies. The term right-wing can generally refer to the section of a political party or system that advocates free enterprise and private ownership, and typically favours socially traditional ideas.\n\nThe term \"privatization\" was invented to describe what the Nazis did in Germany:\n\n>The Economist magazine introduced the term privatisation (alternatively privatisation or reprivatisation after the German Reprivatisierung) during the 1930s when it covered Nazi Germany's economic policy.\n\nLet's see:\n\n>A second cause has to do with the conviction even in the highest ranks of the Nazi elite that private property itself provided important incentives to achieve greater cost consciousness, efficiency gains, and technical progress. The principle that Four Year Plan projects were to be executed as far as possible by private industry was explicitly motivated in the following way: 'It is important to maintain the free initiative of industry.

However, on the whole they remained exceptions indeed. Neither in West Germany nor in the Third Reich can they be seen as a proof of the proposition that enterprises were permanently laboring under the threat of being subjected to force or even nationalized if they did not comply with the wishes of the regime. It rather has to be stated that companies normally could refuse to engage in an investment project designed by the state - without any consequences. Besides those already mentioned there can be cited quite a few additional instances where they did so, even after the implementation of the Four Year Plan and after the beginning of war, both being sometimes considered as watersheds in the economic policy of the regime. In fact, the rhetoric may have become more aggressive after 1936. But the actual behavior of the Nazi state in relations with private enterprises appears to have not changed, because firms continued to act without indication of fear that they could be nationalized or otherwise put under unbearable pressure.",

                          "text": "Why did industrialists fund the Nazi Party in a time of need if they were socialists? Were the industrialists stupid and suicidal or something?\n\nAgain, we don't have to guess and wonder:\n\n>On Monday, 20 February 1933, at 6.00 p.m., a group of about twenty-five businessmen were summoned to attend a private meeting in the villa of Hermann Goering, now acting as president of the Reichstag, at which Hitler, the Reich Chancellor, was to \u2018explain his policies\u2019.\n\n>The guests were an oddly assorted bunch. The invitees included leaders of German industry, men such as Georg von Schnitzler, second in command at IG Farben, Krupp von Bohlen, who was both head-by-marriage of the Krupp empire and the current chairman of the Reich industrial association, and Dr Albert Voegler the CEO of the Vereinigte Stahlwerke, the world\u2019s second largest steel firm. But there were also a number of decidedly second-tier figures on the list. The businessmen were greeted first by Goering and Hjalmar Schacht. Hitler himself appeared only after a considerable wait.\n\n>If the businessmen had expected a discussion of the specifics of economic policy they were to be disappointed. Hitler instead launched into a general survey of the political situation. As in his national address on 1 February, his central theme was the turning point in German history marked by the defeat and revolution of 1918. The experience of the last fourteen years had shown that \u2018private enterprise cannot be maintained in the age of democracy\u2019. Business was founded above all on the principles of personality and individual leadership. Democracy and liberalism led inevitably to Social Democracy and Communism. After fourteen years of degeneration, the moment had now come to resolve the fatal divisions within the German body politic. Hitler would show no mercy towards his enemies on the left. It was time \u2018to crush the other side completely\u2019.\n\n>The next phase in the struggle would begin after the elections of 5 March. If the Nazis were able to gain another 33 seats in the Reichstag, then the actions against the Communists would be covered by \u2018constitutional means\u2019. But, \u2018regardless of the outcome there will be no retreat . . . if the election does not decide . . . the decision must be brought about even by other means\u2019.\n\n>Hitler did not take questions from his audience, nor did he spell out exactly what was expected of the business leaders. Hitler had not come to negotiate. He had come to inform them of his intentions. And his audience can have been left in no doubt. Germany\u2019s new Chancellor planned to put an end to parliamentary democracy. He planned to crush the German left and in the process he was more than willing to use physical force. At least according to the surviving record, the conflict between left and right was the central theme of the speeches by both Hitler and Goering on 20 February. There was no mention either of anti-Jewish policy or a campaign of foreign conquest.\n\n>Hitler left it to Goering to reveal the immediate purpose of the meeting. Since German business had a major stake in the struggle against the left, it should make an appropriate financial contribution. \u2018The sacrifice[s]\u2019, Goering pointed out, \u2018would be so much easier . . . to bear if it [industry] realized that the election of 5 March will surely be the last one for the next ten years, probably even for the next hundred years.\u2019 Krupp von Bohlen, the designated spokesman for the business side, had prepared extensive notes for a detailed discussion of economic policy, but confronted with this bald appeal, he thought better of introducing tedious details. Instead, he confined himself to stating that all present would surely agree on the need for the speediest possible resolution of the political situation. Business fully supported the goal of establishing a government in the interests of the German people.\n\n>Only under a strong and independent state could the economy and business \u2018develop and flourish\u2019. After this exchange of nationalist platitudes, Hitler and Goering departed and Hjalmar Schacht got down to business.\n\n>He proposed an election fund of 3 million Reichsmarks, to be shared between the Nazis and their nationalist coalition partners. Over the following three weeks Schacht received contributions from seventeen different business groups. The largest individual donations came from IG Farben (400,000 Reichsmarks) and the Deutsche Bank (200,000 Reichsmarks). The association of the mining industry also made a generous deposit of 400,000 Reichsmarks. Other large donors included the organizers of the Berlin Automobile Exhibition (100,000 Reichsmarks) and a cluster of electrical engineering corporations including Telefunken, AEG and the Accumu-latoren Fabrik. In the years that followed, the Adolf Hitler Spende was to become institutionalized as a regular contribution to the maintenance of Hitler\u2019s personal expenses.\n\n>In practical terms, however, it was the donations in February and March 1933 that really made the difference. They provided a large cash injection at a moment when the party was severely short of funds and faced, as Goering had predicted, the last competitive election in its history.\n\n- Source: Adam Tooze, \"Wages of Destruction\"",

          "text": "Good observation. I suggest reading Friedrich Kellner's book, \"My Opposition\" - he talks about what you're talking about constantly. It's a diary written by a low-level court clerk and is about his opposition to the Nazi regime shortly before and during the war while living in Laubach, a small town in Germany.\n\nHere's a quote in the book to go along with what you're saying:\n\n>When I think back on these many doleful figures and place-seekers who altered their own views and became Hitler followers to obtain material things, I know that respectable people can feel only shame for such men: a totally sad chapter of self-serving rogues.\n\n>Leaders within the large industries and banks, the nobility, major farmers, teachers, public officials, all these noble characters who showed little understanding for [the laborers in] the social process before 1933, were suddenly converted and transformed and became spirited supporters of the National Socialist German Workers\u2019 Party (NSDAP). White-collar and blue-collar workers [Stirn und Faust] went arm-in-arm. Meaningless phrases were thrashed around day and night until the laborers lost their backbone, forgot their political schooling, and gave up their independent work spirit.\n\n>The conservatives and reactionaries had their greatest triumph when the common worker gave up and sank to the level of a slave. The A to Z of this \u201csocialist\u201d creation was to craftily draw the \u201cOld Fighters\u201d away from the capitalistic class.\n\n>The Nazis offered unimagined possibilities, with Hitler impressing the upper classes with fairy tales about world domination: a vision to which the German has absolutely no resistance. So the largest military buildup of all times came about and, of course, the desired war. The German people will someday sleep off this intoxication, but the hangover will not go away as easily.\n\n>When the curtain finally opens and the theater is visible to the audience without impostors and stage directors, there will be a frightful awakening. Never in the history of a nation have the guilty ones been more evident than now.\n\n>It may be that one or the other bandit will have a higher degree of blame, but in general it is the entire bunch that is guilty. In my view the people of industry and the military officers will be at the head of the line. With few exceptions, they went through thick and thin with Hitler and gave him counsel.\"\n\n- Friedrich Kellner, July 27, 1941",

I'm not a fan of Nazism or any of the other -isms out there, but in the grand scheme of things, Nazism was a tiny blip on the radar. There was a communist named Saul Alinksy who wrote a book called Rules For Radicals, in which he suggests blaming one's enemies for the things they themselves do. This was published around the time that another book, The Gulag Archipeligo, was translated into English & revealed communist crimes against humanity. Personally, I think it's best to meet in the middle and get along with everyone we reasonably can, as both sides get some things right & some things wrong.",

I'm happy to have found your comment by sheer luck.\n\nYes, religion is one way to exert power and influence over people. As the Nazis wanted to have the greatest possible power over the german people, the religions were obviously a competitor to some degree. But the way of the Nazis to deal with them wasn't to become secular. Instead, they adapted religion and slowly transformed it, until it would have effectively become its own \"positive christianity\" version issued by the state. A little similar to how the Anglican church came into being, IIRC, just a lot more slow.\n\nAs for \"not religious\", I think we're in agreement here. I would also put the Nazi regime somewhere around 3-5 in terms of religiousness, on a scale of 0 to 10. So the misunderstanding between us was only in terms of the words we used, not about the ideas behind them. That's a good thing.",

It rankles people when you get falsely compared to Nazis.\n\nThere's also been a lot of using the terms \"socialist\" and \"communist\" as pejoratives (especially by people who could probably never actually correctly describe either political concept). So them using some transitive nonsense like \"Group X is socialist, and the Nazis were socialist, so Group X are basically the same as the Nazis\" is repugnant in the extreme and demonstrates a lot of willful ignorance.\n\nPeople saw the post and probably assumed that you fell for a right-wing meme used to wrongly smear groups the right doesn't like.

They aren't changing the way your body functions (with the possible exception of oxygen deprivation). A person's legal employment status determinant of a bought and sold product injected into their body? \"Oh, but I can just work somewhere else.\" Only as far as the governance allows. If my boss says,, \"Vaxx or lose your job,\" I can find something else somewhere else in the same field nearby. If my Mayor says \"Vaxx or lose your job,\" I can work in the next town. Barely an inconvenience. If my County Legislature or every mayor in the county says, \"Vaxx or lose your job,\" I can work in the next County. It would be annoying, but I could. If my governor or every county in the state says, \"Vaxx or lose your job,\" then I need to start thinking, \"Am I in one of the groups at risk of blood clotting or heart failure? Is it feasible to work in the next State? Will I need to move for my employment?\" If US Federal government says, \"Vaxx or lose your job,\" then that is it. Any amount of training I put into that job, however many years and thousands of dollars put into college for that job, comes to nothing. I either run the risk of being part of one of those with a fatally bad reaction to the vaccine, I become destitute, or I run my luck outside the US, where I will need to retrain to that country's standards and potentially learn a new language entirely.  \n\nYou want the **__real__** conspiracy hot take? I think the only reason masks are being pushed so aggressively is because last time anything like this happened, by the time the virus ran it's course, people stopped buying the masks, which left the manufacturers unable to get rid of their surplus through hospitals and other medical facilities alone. With costs incurred, many of these manufacturers had outstanding debts, so they shut down, which then caused a shortage where they were needed. So, what happens? Big Ronas comes in, and we are told, \"Buy, buy, buy,\" until the surplus is dry. Same with the vaccines. Government paid a lot of money to secure these vaccines, and if they aren't used by a certain date, they expire. All that money, up in flames. So they buy the next run of doses, call it the booster or whatever, and start pushing ultimatums to employers: \"Your staff is vaccinated or you incur a fine.\" To which the fine is used to recoup the cost. All under the guise of \"Public safety,\" or some nonsense.",

Nazism rejected the Marxist concepts of class conflict and universal equality, opposed cosmopolitan internationalism, and sought to convince all parts of the new German society to subordinate their personal interests to the \"common good\", accepting political interests as the main priority of economic organisation** \"\n\n\n\nHuh, weird, sounds pretty different from socialism, but okay...\n\n\n\n\"The Nazi Party's precursor, the pan-German nationalist and antisemitic German Workers' Party (DAP), was founded on 5 January 1919. **By the early 1920s, the party was renamed the National Socialist German Workers' Party to attract workers away from left-wing parties such as the Social Democrats (SPD) and the Communists (KPD), and Adolf Hitler assumed control of the organisation.** The National Socialist Program, or \"25 Points\", was adopted in 1920 and called for a united Greater Germany that would deny citizenship to Jews or those of Jewish descent, while also supporting land reform and the nationalisation of some industries. **In Mein Kampf, literally \"My Struggle\", published in 1925\u20131926, Hitler outlined the antisemitism and anti-communism at the heart of his political philosophy as well as his disdain for representative democracy and his belief in Germany's right to territorial expansion**.\"\n\n\n\nOh so they hated leftists and were just using the name to draw people away from them? Weird.\n\n\"**The Nazis claimed that communism was dangerous to the well-being of nations because of its intention to dissolve private property, its support of class conflict, its aggression against the middle class, its hostility towards small business and its atheism.\\[286\\] Nazism rejected class conflict-based socialism and economic egalitarianism, favouring instead a stratified economy with social classes based on merit and talent, retaining private property and the creation of national solidarity that transcends class distinction** \"\n\nSo in total, we have...opposed globalism (free trade), anti-communist, in favor of private property, protecting small businesses, anti-class equality, anti immigration, dislike of democracy...\n\nYep, classic socialism.",

There was a \"National Socialist German Workers Party\", or \"Nazi\" for short, but it wasn't socialist. \n\nThey added \"National Socialist\" to the name of the former \"German Workers Party\" in order to co-opt socialism in order attract low-income working class people who were also being courted by the communists, who the Nazis very much hated. By adding \"national\" to the name, they could tie far-right nationalist policies to the party.\n\nLong and short of it is that they added \"socialist\" in order to fool people. They're still fooling people, so it looks like it worked.\n\nOne of the very first things the Nazis did was round up members of the Social Democrat Party (the actual socialists) and put them all in concentration camps.\n\nHere's an article with more information: https://www.vox.com/2019/3/27/18283879/nazism-socialism-hitler-gop-brooks-gohmert\n\nMy favorite bit is this:\n\n\"But one of their core assumptions \u2014 \u201cNazis were socialists\u201d \u2014 has become one of the biggest memes within a swath of the American Right. And it is woefully, almost hilariously incorrect.\"",

In particular,\u00a0Nicholas Sarwark\u00a0and\u00a0Arvin Vohra, then the chair and vice-chair of the\u00a0United States Libertarian Party, condemned Deist's speech, with Vohra stating that \"the Mises Institute has been turned into a sales funnel for the White Nationalist branch of the Alt Right\". Vohra further accused the Mises Institute as a whole of being \"authoritarian, racist, nazi\".\n\nMises wasn't even alive when the institute was founded.",

It had to allow Strasser, Goebbels and the crank Feder to beguile the masses with the cry that the National Socialists were truly 'socialists' and against the money barons. On the other hand, money to keep the party going had to be wheedled out of those who had an ample supply of it. Throughout the latter half of 1931, says Dietrich, Hitler 'traversed Germany from end to end, holding private interviews with prominent [business] personalities.' So hush-hush were some of these meetings that they had to be held 'in some lonely forest glade. Privacy,' explains Dietrich, 'was absolutely imperative; the press must have no chance of doing mischief. Success was the consequence.' \n\n- William L.

          "text": "Well that's ironic.\n\nDems don't want \"complete\" gun control, generally speaking, and a notable majority of Americans are in favor of stricter gun control independent of political affiliation. Also, Nazis didn't push gun control in a manner intended to remove guns from the streets - they pushed gun control in a manner intended to remove guns from the hands of anyone who wasn't a Nazi.\n\nDems don't want \"complete power over the education system.\" I'm not even sure what point you're trying to make here. But I'll point out that it's not Democrats pushing to ban certain subjects from school, control what students read, and present \"alternate views\" on matters such as evolution and the Holocaust. Though Republicans notably don't want to present \"alternate views\" on matters of religion in general. Weird.\n\nAnd \"taxpayer funded abortion\" is a non-starter of an argument: The insistence that a person's taxes shouldn't be used in a manner they disagree with never comes coupled with the agreement that such logic should apply to anything other than abortion. So the argument ends up looking like a flimsy cover for a person's issue with abortion specifically, rather than how it is funded.\n\nThe \"Islam thing\" is actually somewhat accurate, in that Nazis recruited Muslim troops to fight on their behalf in Muslim-populated territories. The propaganda used to recruit said troops appealed to anti-Semitic sentiment against the Zionist movement. While this sentiment was a deciding factor for some Muslim recruits, it was more a matter of Nazis convincing Nazis that recruiting Muslims was on-brand.",

Look at what happened after the Assault Weapons Ban passed in the early 90's.\n\nEver since the Orange Guy came up, I became aware of something really curious: some of his white nationalist followers displaying Nazi symbolism were talking about the libs coming for their guns. Hitler literally did exactly that. Anyway, I later decided to just chalk it up to them being idiots, since it doesn't have to be much more complicated than that.\n\nAlso about the Muslim thing: The Nazis were generally OK with religion, as long as it didn't take power from the state. The Catholics they were iffy on, since they had a political party which opposed the Weimar Republic and so there was a grudge of sorts. But it wasn't too much of a reach to bring in a bunch of people who certainly had no love for Jews and say \"Go get 'em!\", then turn around and tell your own people that look, these dudes don't like Jews either.",

Marxism is anti-property; true socialism is not.\n\nThe ideology that dominates us is in diametrical contradiction to that of Soviet Russia. National Socialism is a doctrine that has reference exclusively to the German people. Bolshevism lays stress on international mission. We National Socialists believe a man can, in the long run, be happy only among his own people.\n\nWe National Socialists see in private property a higher level of human economic development that according to the differences in performance controls the management of what has been accomplished enabling and guaranteeing the advantage of a higher standard of living for everyone. Bolshevism destroys not only private property but also private initiative and the readiness to shoulder responsibility.\n\nWhat right do these people have to demand a share of property or even in administration?... The employer who accepts the responsibility for production also gives the workpeople their means of livelihood. Our greatest industrialists are not concerned with the acquisition of wealth or with good living, but, above all else, with responsibility and power. They have worked their way to the top by their own abilities, and this proof of their capacity \u2013 a capacity only displayed by a higher race \u2013 gives them the right to lead.\"\n\nYou see that end bit about workers not having a share of property or administration?  Literally the opposite of modern socialism.",

The question is, do you stand opposed to most or all of those tenants?\n\nHe wanted a populist, \"workers\" movement to strip the rights, freedoms, and property from some... to benefit a collective.  Accomplished it.  Then became a tyrant and killed many tens of millions to accomplish such, once he attained power over them.  Then threatened, invaded, attacked, occupied, killed, and oppressed many more.\n\nCollectivism always leads to oppression of the individual, and leads to tyranny.  Collectivism in all of its inglorious iterations has resulted in the deaths of hundreds of millions.  It takes both rights and responsibility from the individual.  It removes individual sovereignty and denies its value.\n\nWhy do the huddled masses yearning to be free come?  When they flee their worker's paradise, where do they go... and why?  Why do boatloads of Cubans flee?  Why did East Germans risk almost certain death to escape?  Why do North Koreans walk through the Gobi desert?  Is it because they wanted modern socialism?  Why do they leave, and where do they go?\n\nI'd argue (because they themselves argue) they don't want anything to do with collectivist tyranny.  Head over to Miami and talk to the Cuban population... see what they think of your \"modern\" interpretation.  Let them inform your understanding with real experience.  Marxist professors aren't known for propaganda and agitation.  Not a hallmark of Collectivism at all... or National Socialist Workers parties for that matter. \n\nIt's not that it hasn't been done right, it's that it's not right, and therefore can't be done.  You can always vote your way into it, but you'll have to fight your way out.  Collectivism is a scourge.\n\nYou have many choices of places to flee if that's what you want today.  Perilously few if you're looking to escape.  But why not eliminate the one/few, right?  So we can all be the same.  It's for our own good after all.  Plus, there's a free pair of jackboots in every box of conformity flakes.\n\nThose advocating for socialism & communism are never the poor b@stards that have actually been subjected to it.",

Marxism is anti-property; true socialism is not.\n\nThe ideology that dominates us is in diametrical contradiction to that of Soviet Russia. National Socialism is a doctrine that has reference exclusively to the German people. Bolshevism lays stress on international mission. We National Socialists believe a man can, in the long run, be happy only among his own people.\n\nWe National Socialists see in private property a higher level of human economic development that according to the differences in performance controls the management of what has been accomplished enabling and guaranteeing the advantage of a higher standard of living for everyone. Bolshevism destroys not only private property but also private initiative and the readiness to shoulder responsibility.\n\nWhat right do these people have to demand a share of property or even in administration?... The employer who accepts the responsibility for production also gives the workpeople their means of livelihood. Our greatest industrialists are not concerned with the acquisition of wealth or with good living, but, above all else, with responsibility and power. They have worked their way to the top by their own abilities, and this proof of their capacity \u2013 a capacity only displayed by a higher race \u2013 gives them the right to lead.\"\n\nThat last paragraph about people having no right to demand a share of property or administration?  LITERALLY the opposite of the definition of socialism you provided.  Hitler went out of his way to clarify that the Nazis weren't socialists in the common sense.",

However both are still offshoot economic ideologies of socialism even if they don't follow all of the exact same ideas that Marxist socialism which later became bolshevism which later became Communism.

Sorry, but some Canadian conservative (who has skin in the game of making socialism sound bad) isn't disproving decades of political theory\n\n>Regardless they still considered themselves socialists\n\nThey can \"consider\" themselves whatever they'd like, that doesn't make it true.  Mussolini literally worked against the socialist party of Italy.\n\nThe parliament of Italy was fractured and the only significant party was the Socialists. This scared the conservatives who began to support Mussolini.  \n\nHitler spent the 1920s pushing back on leftist social reforms, busting unions (he even outright prohibited the creation of Nazi trade unions), and overall opposing the ACTUAL socialist & communist parties of Germany.\n\nHitler only called the Nazis socialist because he liked the populist connotations of the word.  He had absolutely no inclination to challenge capitalism.  He held the view that owners of wealth deserved it, almost by divine right.\n\nMore of Hitler's thoughts on socialism:\n\n\"Your socialism is Marxism pure and simple. You see, the great mass of workers only wants bread and circuses. Ideas are not accessible to them and we cannot hope to win them over. We attach ourselves to the fringe, the race of lords, which did not grow through a miserabilist doctrine and knows by the virtue of its own character that it is called to rule, and rule without weakness over the masses of beings.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur great heads of industry are not concerned with the accumulation of wealth and the good life, rather they are concerned with responsibility and power. They have acquired this right by natural selection: they are members of the higher race. But you would surround them with a council of incompetents, who have no notion of anything. No economic leader can accept that.\u201d\n\n\"The state will only intervene if people do not act in the interest of the nation.\"\n\n^ That's just free market capitalism with a dash of authoritarianism.\n\nI could go on, but if Hitler repeatedly and adamantly fighting against socialists isn't enough for you, nothing will be.",

That was my comment.  Here, I'll be less non-committal:  Hitler was not a socialist in any sense.

Working with conservatives against socialists led by an ideology that the Socialists rejected pretty firmly established Mussolini as no longer a socialist.  He was only really in that party in the first place because of his father.\n\n>You also never listed a country actually run by a council\n\nI mean, you never asked and even if you did it's kind of beside the point.  Whether or not it comes to fruition, workers' councils are central to socialist ideology and Hitler argued tooth and nail against them.\n\n >he didn't spend the 20-30s ousting socialists\n\nYes he did, there was the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany, the Majority Social Democrats, and other left wing socialist parties in Germany at the time.

As you said it creates very little opportunity to adequately define different ideologies.\n\nOnly allows us to do so with broad strokes. I am saying that within our, understanding of the spectrum or at least my own they are not right wing. In my understanding they are left wing ideologically. Though I will say this is a poor toolbox for explaining Nazism or any other party system.\n\nThis definitely isn't why people don't want to answer my question. Most people just say \"no\" because they genuinely have no reply. I'll read what your article and see if it corrects me. \n\nBut at the end of the day I'm already more than happy to concede to an opinion that states Nazism was not simply right OR left. That explaining it is much more complex etc.\nI just have a problem when people say it's right wing. As I really can't understand how in any fashion that's true.

No political organization is ever going to 100% match their descriptive ideology, so it\u2019s important to discern whether the discussion is about theory or practice. The definition of fascism you have is theoretical\u2026 ideological\u2026 while the examples of the supposed \u201cleft\u201d (legitimacy of your claims aside) are practical and concrete examples. \n\nFor example, the Soviet Union did not follow 100% of communist tenets. Nazi Germany did not follow 100% of fascist tenets. Therefore, by cherry picking examples, you could argue that neither nation *actually* followed their supposed ideology based on a small number of practices.\n\nPolitical ideology is supposed to be descriptive, not prescriptive. The fact remains that Fascism as a philosophy is a right wing ideology, even if practicing governments may or may not share some characteristics with left wing governments.",

Points 13, 14 and 15 are quite interesting.  \n\nPoint 13 *We demand nationalization of all businesses which have been up to the present formed into companies (trusts).*\n\nThe Democrats often speak of nationalizing businesses, which the Republican oppose vehemently.\n\nPoint 14 *We demand that the profits from wholesale trade shall be shared out.*\n\nThis is simply redistribution of wealth, straight from Karl Marx.\n\nPoint 15 *We demand an expansion on a large scale of old age welfare.*\n\nMedicare for all, universal healthcare, the expansion of Medicaid.\n\nNazi founder, Gottfried Feder once said the point of the Nazi party \"was to reconcile nationalism and socialism.\"  The name change from German Worker's Party to National Socialist German Worker's Party happened shortly after Hitler joined in 1919.  Feder gave the lecture which inspired Adolf Hitler to join the party. \n\nSource: Nietzsche and the Nazis: A Personal View By: Stephen R.C. Hicks\n\nThis is a great read if you'd like to find out more about the ideology and psychological inspiration of the Nazi party.  It talks about the religious aspect of the Nazi's vs Nietzsche's view on the Jewish people.  To sum up, Nietzsche saw the most humans as worthless, the Jews being some the worst, but Christians being even worse and the 2 religions being identical and worthless.  Hitler and his cohorts disagreed and would often deny Jesus had been a Jew at all.\n\nHitler did not like communism or Marxism, in that, he and the party felt those ideals focused too much on money and anti-capitalism.  He believed this should only be part of the overall plan.  A physically strong and resilient population, a large national army, and getting rid of the Jews were more important than money.  Nationalizing most industries, apart from a few businesses which were thriving (not too mention owned by his friends or friends of people in his ranks), nationalizing healthcare, media, education, etc. would take care of the money part.  \n\nGottfried Feder wrote the following books and manifestos.\n\n1. The German State on a National and Socialist Foundation\n2. Manifesto for Breaking the Financial Slavery to Interest\n3. The Programme of the NSDAP: The National Socialist German Worker's Party and Its General Conceptions\n\nThis is one of the co-founders of the Nazi party.  Feder goes deep into how Germany should be very socialist and very nationalist at the same time.  He focused on interest, loans, banking etc.  And attempted to nationalize and socialize money in Germany at the same time.\n\n\u201eThe interest capitalistic inflation however is like a devouring fire which is not extinguished until it has consumed all the treasures of the world and made the whole of mankind interest-slaves of international finance\u2014or until the interest slavery is broken.\u201c \u2014 Gottfried Feder\n\nSource: The German State on a National and Socialist Foundation (1923), pp. 117-118\n\n\nThe plan was simple, take it all over, nationalize banks and make profits from interest illegal.\n\n\u201eTherefore we demand as a fundamental law of the state: \u2026\u201c \u2014 Gottfried Feder\n\nSource: \"Manifesto for the Abolition of Enslavement to Interest on Money\" (1919)\n\n\n\nSo we see the Nazi party with very socialist and nationalist views and policies.  They hated the west and capitalism, Democrats in America are constantly talking about nationalizing businesses. Off hand I can remember talks a few years ago about nationalizing telephone, internet and television service.  At&t, Comcast, Verizon and Cox were the ones who were making too much money at the time if memory serves.\n\nThe constant talk about businesses and the rich needing to be taxed more is right out of the Nazi playbook.  This can be noted in point 14 and 24 of the Nazi party program \n\nPoint 14: *We demand that the profits from wholesale trade shall be shared out.*\n\nPoint 24: *We demand freedom of religion for all religious denominations within the state so long as they do not endanger its existence or oppose the moral senses of the Germanic race. The Party as such advocates the standpoint of a positive Christianity without binding itself confessionally to any one denomination. It combats the Jewish-materialistic spirit within and around us and is convinced that a lasting recovery of our nation can only succeed from within on the framework.\n\n    THE COMMON INTEREST OVER INDIVIDUAL INTEREST*\n\nTaking all profits (taxation) and making sure that money goes to the common interest, so as not to be like the materialistic Jews.  Or tax the rich to pay for socialist programs because the rich has too much.\n\n\n\n\nI could go into the racism of the left, in particular the constant push over the decades for black people to abort as many babies as possible.  The evidence of black fathers being swept away into prisons in order to allow the government to take their place.  The fact that black families were doing better before the welfare state took over and more but I'm pretty tired of giving this history lesson.",

The rights of \u201cgood Germans\u201d were generally respected especially in the earlier years. Political rights were trampled on but property rights were well respected for Germans, certainly not for Jews and other minority groups but for the majority of the population, suitably aryan, their economic lives were largely privately managed, maybe some rationing, with private investments and private property like we do ourselves.\n\nThere were major programs like the autobahn network and labor divisions for the unemployed, but spending programs for infrastructure especially militarily useful infrastructure are hardly foreign to right wing governments.\n\nThe USSR was centrally planned at this point but the economy of Nazi germany was more pro- free market than America of FDR\u2019s new deal.

Major industry was mostly owned by the same set of industrialists who existed before the Nazis. The Nazis didn\u2019t replace them with their own people. You made that up.\n\nThe Nazis didn\u2019t secretly control the economy at the grand scale. They just didn\u2019t. It was never part of their agenda with the only exception being massive military spending programs. They didn\u2019t control production secretly or covertly or publicly or in any way at all. Even into 1944 they agonized over a decision to nationalize steel producers, that\u2019s how much they were committed to private industry. Speers reorganization of industry didn\u2019t happen until 1943 when the economy was collapsing, their rule began back in 1933 so trying to say Speers program reflected their economic control would be false and Speers reorganization mostly refused nationalization\u2019s anyway on ideological grounds.\n\nThey didn\u2019t punish industrialists for refusing their desires. Major arms producers refused contracts all the time and weren\u2019t punished for it.\n\nYou\u2019re just making shit up. You\u2019re talking out of your ass. Did you learn history from PragerU?",

They want to block their own country from crating vital pipelines while supporting other counties including RUSSIA to build more but claim they can\u2019t be done in the Us because of global warming but apparently okay in other parts of the world. They want to force states to fully open their boarders to ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS, and force those states to eat all the costs associated with letting them in.\n\nAll the while the Right is too pussy to move or do anything but hold the status quo.

For Landa, Spenger strongly opposed labor strikes, trade unions, progressive taxation or any imposition of taxes on the rich, any shortening of the working day, as well as any form of government insurance for sickness, old age, accidents, or unemployment. At the same time as he rejected any social democratic provisions, Spengler celebrated private property, competition, imperialism, capital accumulation, and 'wealth, collected in few hands and among the ruling classes'. Landa describes Spengler's 'Prussian Socialism' as 'working a whole lot, for the absolute minimum, but \u2014 and this is a vital aspect \u2014 being happy about it.'",

In the first five years of the regime, convictions under section 218 increased by 50%, while birth control centers were shut down and access to contraception was curtailed. During World War II, the Nazis called for the death penalty for repeat offenders against section 218. While the Nazis imposed a very strict anti-abortion scheme for healthy 'Aryans,' they allowed and encouraged abortion if either of the parents was believed to carry hereditary defects. The Nazis further undermined family planning by strictly enforcing existing prohibitions on the display and advertising of contraception. On May 26, 1933, the Nazis re-introduced the prohibitions on publicity or education regarding abortion or abortifacients that had been abolished during the Weimar Republic. Doctors were understandably anxious about referring patients for therapeutic abortions in such circumstances, and the number of referrals declined from about 44,000 in 1932 to 4,131 in 1937.\n\n- \"Abortion and Women's Legal Personhood in Germany: A Contribution to the Feminist Theory of State\", by D.A.

I can't ever say that but I believe it.\" [Just like you, he can never say it publicly, but he believes in it.]\n\n>\"No, but if you get elected a second time, then we might be able to do something,\" Graham replied.

He references an executive with the 1968-1973 NBC hit show, \"Rowan and Martin's Laugh-in,\" as once informing him that 11 of its 12 writers were Jewish. (Nixon surfaced on an episode during the 1968 presidential campaign as part of his attempt at reinvention, famously uttering, \"Sock-it-to-me!\" a well-known catchphrase of actress Judy Carne, a show regular.) \n\n>\"That right?\" said Graham. \n\n>Nixon seamlessly continued by asserting that Life magazine, Newsweek, The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times were among those \"totally dominated by the Jews.\" And, he said, the famous broadcast network anchors Howard K. Smith, David Brinkley and Walter Cronkite were \"front men who may not be of that persuasion,\" but that their writers were \"95 percent Jewish.\" \n\n>Nixon, being Nixon, qualified his broadside by declaring that this didn't mean \"that all the Jews are bad.\" But, nevertheless, most were of leftish persuasion and desired \"peace at any price except where support for Israel is concerned. The best Jews are actually the Israeli Jews.\" [Which is why Nixon wanted Billy Graham, his fellow anti-Semite to become an ambassador to Israel.]\n\nThis conversation is on tape, by the way.",

          "text": ">On Monday, 20 February 1933, at 6.00 p.m., a group of about twenty-five businessmen were summoned to attend a private meeting in the villa of Hermann Goering, now acting as president of the Reichstag, at which Hitler, the Reich Chancellor, was to \u2018explain his policies\u2019.\n\n>The guests were an oddly assorted bunch. The invitees included leaders of German industry, men such as Georg von Schnitzler, second in command at IG Farben, Krupp von Bohlen, who was both head-by-marriage of the Krupp empire and the current chairman of the Reich industrial association, and Dr Albert Voegler the CEO of the Vereinigte Stahlwerke, the world\u2019s second largest steel firm. But there were also a number of decidedly second-tier figures on the list. The businessmen were greeted first by Goering and Hjalmar Schacht. Hitler himself appeared only after a considerable wait.\n\n> If the businessmen had expected a discussion of the specifics of economic policy they were to be disappointed. Hitler instead launched into a general survey of the political situation. As in his national address on 1 February, his central theme was the turning point in German history marked by the defeat and revolution of 1918. The experience of the last fourteen years had shown that \u2018private enterprise cannot be maintained in the age of democracy\u2019. Business was founded above all on the principles of personality and individual leadership. Democracy and liberalism led inevitably to Social Democracy and Communism. After fourteen years of degeneration, the moment had now come to resolve the fatal divisions within the German body politic. Hitler would show no mercy towards his enemies on the left. It was time \u2018to crush the other side completely\u2019. \n\n>The next phase in the struggle would begin after the elections of 5 March. If the Nazis were able to gain another 33 seats in the Reichstag, then the actions against the Communists would be covered by \u2018constitutional means\u2019. But, \u2018regardless of the outcome there will be no retreat . . . if the election does not decide . . . the decision must be brought about even by other means\u2019.\n\n>Hitler did not take questions from his audience, nor did he spell out exactly what was expected of the business leaders. Hitler had not come to negotiate. He had come to inform them of his intentions. And his audience can have been left in no doubt. Germany\u2019s new Chancellor planned to put an end to parliamentary democracy. He planned to crush the German left and in the process he was more than willing to use physical force. At least according to the surviving record, the conflict between left and right was the central theme of the speeches by both Hitler and Goering on 20 February. There was no mention either of anti-Jewish policy or a campaign of foreign conquest.\n\n>Hitler left it to Goering to reveal the immediate purpose of the meeting. Since German business had a major stake in the struggle against the left, it should make an appropriate financial contribution. \u2018The sacrifice[s]\u2019, Goering pointed out, \u2018would be so much easier . . . to bear if it [industry] realized that the election of 5 March will surely be the last one for the next ten years, probably even for the next hundred years.\u2019 Krupp von Bohlen, the designated spokesman for the business side, had prepared extensive notes for a detailed discussion of economic policy, but confronted with this bald appeal, he thought better of introducing tedious details. Instead, he confined himself to stating that all present would surely agree on the need for the speediest possible resolution of the political situation. Business fully supported the goal of establishing a government in the interests of the German people.\n\n>Only under a strong and independent state could the economy and business \u2018develop and flourish\u2019.\nAfter this exchange of nationalist platitudes, Hitler and Goering departed and Hjalmar Schacht got down to business. \n\n>He proposed an election fund of 3 million Reichsmarks, to be shared between the Nazis and their nationalist coalition partners. Over the following three weeks Schacht received contributions from seventeen different business groups. The largest individual donations came from IG Farben (400,000 Reichsmarks) and the Deutsche Bank (200,000 Reichsmarks). The association of the mining industry also made a generous deposit of 400,000 Reichsmarks. Other large donors included the organizers of the Berlin Automobile Exhibition (100,000 Reichsmarks) and a cluster of electrical engineering corporations including Telefunken, AEG and the Accumu-latoren Fabrik. In the years that followed, the Adolf Hitler Spende was to become institutionalized as a regular contribution to the maintenance of Hitler\u2019s personal expenses.\n\n>In practical terms, however, it was the donations in February and March 1933 that really made the difference. They provided a large cash injection at a moment when the party was severely short of funds and faced, as Goering had predicted, the last competitive election in its history.\n\n- Source: Adam Tooze, \"Wages of Destruction\"",

                  "text": "Here's an excerpt from before he came to power:\n\n>Strasser said that he did deny it: National Socialism was an idea which was still in evolution, and in that evolutionary process Hitler certainly played a specially important role. The 'idea' itself was Socialism. Here Hitler interrupted Strasser by declaring that this so-called Socialism was nothing but pure Marxism. There was no such thing as a capitalist system. A factory-owner was depended upon his workmen. If they went on strike, then his so-called property became utterly worthless. At this point Hitler turned to his neighbour Amann and said: 'What right have these people to demand a share in property or even in the administration? Herr Amann, would you permit your typist to have any voice in your affairs? The employer who accepts the responsibility for production also gives the workpeople their means of livelihood. Our greatest industrialists are not concerned with the acquisition of wealth or with good living, but, above all else, with responsibility and power. They have worked their way to the top by their own abilities, and this proof of their capacity -- a capacity only displayed by a higher race--gives them the right to lead.\n\nHe was inspired by something called \"Prussian socialism\":\n\n>Spengler's Prussian socialism was popular amongst the German political right, especially the revolutionary right who had distanced themselves from traditional conservatism. His notions of Prussian socialism influenced Nazism and the Conservative Revolutionary movement.\"\n\n>Historian Ishay Landa has described the nature of 'Prussian socialism' as decidedly capitalist. For Landa, Spenger strongly opposed labor strikes, trade unions, progressive taxation or any imposition of taxes on the rich, any shortening of the working day, as well as any form of government insurance for sickness, old age, accidents, or unemployment. At the same time as he rejected any social democratic provisions, Spengler celebrated private property, competition, imperialism, capital accumulation, and 'wealth, collected in few hands and among the ruling classes'. Landa describes Spengler's 'Prussian Socialism' as 'working a whole lot, for the absolute minimum, but \u2014 and this is a vital aspect \u2014 being happy about it.'\n\nAs you can see, these are all right-wing ideas.\n\nIshay Landa describes why the need to call this idea socialist or why the Nazis were called as such:\n\n>Juxtaposing the two elements of Spengler\u2019s worldview, a market economy geared towards national greatness, we get a political combination which should objectively be termed \u201cnational capitalism,\u201d or, maybe, \u201cPrussian imperialism.\u201d \n\n>Socialism in any meaningful sense just does not come into it at all. In fact, socialism is precisely that which is expurgated at both levels: at the  economic sphere since it impedes growth, and at the \u201cgreat\u201d political sphere since it posits peaceful international coexistence, which would make  impossible the Spenglerian endorsement of imperialism.\n\n>Socialism is but the traitor that must be  driven out of the fortress. We can now understand why Spengler himself, in his later years, explicitly took the air out of his former \u201csocialism\u201d: \u201cHere a great education is necessary, which I have called Prussian and small politics might be called \u2018socialistic\u2019\u2014what do words matter!\u201d (210). \n\n>But why did Spengler, being for all practical purposes a capitalist, use the term socialism in the first place? Why couldn\u2019t he have just brandished a project of \u201cPrussian Imperialism,\u201d which would have represented his views infinitely better than the banner of \u201cPrussian  Socialism\u201d? It is not difficult to guess the answer, unless one is straightjacketed by an approach that construes fascists as forthright. Capitalism had scarce little popular appeal after the First World War and amidst protracted world economic crisis. A much better prospect for supporters of capitalism lay in feigning to embrace socialism, so as to infiltrate it inside an ideological and political Trojan horse and defeat it from within.\"\n\n- \"Sorceror's Apprentice\", Ishay Landa, 2010, pages 69-70\n\nEvery single conservative voted for Hitler's Enabling Act.",

There is a alt-left. Regardless of how the term originated or was meant to be used. Regardless of how it was \"meant\" to be used or your feelings towards its existance. The term alt-left is generally accepted.

In fact, in the previous comment I clearly indicated how alt-left rhetoric allows a rationalized mechanism for dehuminizing a large swath of people for the sake of self-affirment. \n\nFor example. You claim republicans have constructed a law and order system to oppress black people using the inherent \"evil\" nature they poses as the sole reason for why they would do it. \n\nIn other word, you dehuminze them in order to explain their actions and validate your own beliefs.\n\nYet this inherently blinds a persons ability to see the actuall cause of your own given example.\n\nIn the example you gave about unfair bias towards sentencing. I agree that it does happen and I agree it should be stopped. However, I do not agree that its because of the \"evil republicans\"\n\nIn truth.... what I think we see happening is a socio-economic outcome. \n\nFrom what I understand (and correct me if I'm wrong, because I will freely admit I am basing this on what was seen on tv an inequalities pointed out during the recent blm movement I heard online) many black people in america tend to be lower class or lower-middle class compared to other races. \n\nWhen a judge needs to assess sentencing, he has to take that into account. A person from a lower class area is far more likely to persue drug related activities when given a \"second chance\". \n\nA person from upper middle class or upper class, when given a rehad sentence, is often not only capable of affording proper treatment but also using the \"second chance\" simply because he will have less stress and more reasources. \n\nJudges I think inherently know this disparity in outcome as they have seen it occur repeatedly in their careers, and I think it is the central driver in their decision making. Hence fueling the unfair bias we see.\n\nThe solution to your own example then is not to \"destroy the evil republicans\", but instead to uplift the people from poverty.",

You're getting so abstract now [that] you're talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you're talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is [that] blacks get hurt worse than whites.

But I'm saying that if it is getting that abstract, and that coded, that we are doing away with the racial problem one way or the other.

With enough effort a person can take a excerpt on *anything* and use it to validate *any* point. The act of thinking that if it was writen somewhere it must be true is *heavily* misguided. \n\nI was thinking I would do a 2 min google search and give you some stuff, but then just when I started posting a few extracts to prove my point that the alt-left exists I realized the act of doing so would validate the highly misguided notion that if it is writen it must be true. (Also, I did not fully agree with many of the definitions I found, simply because I feel they often do not full characterize the culture I am percieving)\n\nI was however, able to find a article that echos my notion that alt-left rhetoric often catylises alt-right rhetoric:\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theatlantic.com/amp/article/560285/\n\nAlthough I do not feel the mechanism that is not described here is a full explanation of the mechanisms I percieved.\n\n\nAlso, there is an additional problem I must discuss. You seem to desperately be trying to push the conversation in a direction that seeks to claim I am somehow republican or support it's views, which I am not. I actually don't care much for them. Nor do I care for the alt-left (or the far-left, if that makes you feel more comfortable)\n\nI want to try for the third time now (hopefully, now, this time it clicks) to make you self-aware by indicating that you are attempting to dehuminize me (and also the republicans) by forcing a label. \n\nYou seek to force this dehuminization in an attempt to validate i'll treatment of others and establish a self-constructed moral high ground for the sake of belitlling others without having to justify your poor treatment and bigotry. It gives you the luxury of claiming their opinions are \"irrelivant\" because it is \"right winged bigotry\" when in truth your own arguments inherently seek to establish a position of elitism that you may claim.\n\nThat *is* alt left behaviour. \n\nThe very act of going to great lengths to define a moral framework for the sake of dehuminizing others and mainianing an air of \"untouchable\" morality is inherently not only classically elitist, but a pivitol hallmark of alt-left behaviour. \n\nMost interestingly of all, is that when I did my 2 min google search I found a variety of articles that seek to rationalize away the existence of the idea of an \"alt-left\". \n\nThe irony of this lies in the truth that by doing so they display the very same charecteristic I just discussed (they construct their own moral framework and use it to rationalize that the far-left are incapable of the same level of bigotry or dehuminization of others, therefore they cannot be alt-left and are permited to treat the right wing poorly)\n\nIt just dawned on me that a key motivation for why you engage me so is that by calling you alt-left, I seem to be challanging your self-constructed moral framework.\n\nYou do not want the alt-left to exist because you don't want to consider that perhaps you have been treating others poorly.\n\nEdit: after re-reading your comment, I notice your opening statement about nazis just proves that you never bothered to absorb what I am saying. You are only reading what I send on a surface level. You have been doing this repeatedly miss, so I'm actually not gonna reply to your next message, unless I can see that you actually bothered to read and engage with the truth I am trying to make you aware of",

They were capitalists that pretended to be socialists.\n\n>Juxtaposing the two elements of Spengler\u2019s worldview, a market economy geared towards national greatness, we get a political combination which should objectively be termed \u201cnational capitalism,\u201d or, maybe, \u201cPrussian imperialism.\u201d \n\n>Socialism in any meaningful sense just does not come into it at all. In fact, socialism is precisely that which is expurgated at both levels: at the economic sphere since it impedes growth, and at the \u201cgreat\u201d political sphere since it posits peaceful international coexistence, which would make  impossible the Spenglerian endorsement of imperialism.\n\n>Socialism is but the traitor that must be  driven out of the fortress.

Why couldn\u2019t he have just brandished a project of \u201cPrussian Imperialism,\u201d which would have represented his views infinitely better than the banner of \u201cPrussian  Socialism\u201d? It is not difficult to guess the answer, unless one is straightjacketed by an approach that construes fascists as forthright. Capitalism had scarce little popular appeal after the First World War and amidst protracted world economic crisis. A much better prospect for supporters of capitalism lay in feigning to embrace socialism, so as to infiltrate it inside an ideological and political Trojan horse and defeat it from within.\"\n\n- \"Sorceror's Apprentice\", Ishay Landa, 2010, pages 69-70",

In the first five years of the regime, convictions under section 218 increased by 50%, while birth control centers were shut down and access to contraception was curtailed. During World War II, the Nazis called for the death penalty for repeat offenders against section 218. While the Nazis imposed a very strict anti-abortion scheme for healthy 'Aryans,' they allowed and encouraged abortion if either of the parents was believed to carry hereditary defects. The Nazis further undermined family planning by strictly enforcing existing prohibitions on the display and advertising of contraception. On May 26, 1933, the Nazis re-introduced the prohibitions on publicity or education regarding abortion or abortifacients that had been abolished during the Weimar Republic. Doctors were understandably anxious about referring patients for therapeutic abortions in such circumstances, and the number of referrals declined from about 44,000 in 1932 to 4,131 in 1937.\n\n- \"Abortion and Women's Legal Personhood in Germany: A Contribution to the Feminist Theory of State\", by D.A.

There's a reason the Nazis ousted the leftist parties of Germany when they took power.\n\nHitler's own words on his definition of socialist:\n\n\"Our adopted term 'Socialist' has nothing to do with Marxian Socialism. Marxism is anti-property; true socialism is not.\n\nThe ideology that dominates us is in diametrical contradiction to that of Soviet Russia. National Socialism is a doctrine that has reference exclusively to the German people. Bolshevism lays stress on international mission. We National Socialists believe a man can, in the long run, be happy only among his own people.\n\nWe National Socialists see in private property a higher level of human economic development that according to the differences in performance controls the management of what has been accomplished enabling and guaranteeing the advantage of a higher standard of living for everyone. Bolshevism destroys not only private property but also private initiative and the readiness to shoulder responsibility.\n\nWhat right do these people have to demand a share of property or even in administration?... The employer who accepts the responsibility for production also gives the workpeople their means of livelihood. Our greatest industrialists are not concerned with the acquisition of wealth or with good living, but, above all else, with responsibility and power. They have worked their way to the top by their own abilities, and this proof of their capacity \u2013 a capacity only displayed by a higher race \u2013 gives them the right to lead.\"\n\nYou see that part about not giving the people control of property or administration?  Literally the opposite of the modern socialist 'seize the means of production'.\n\nLearn some history and stop lying.",

The party had to play both sides of the tracks. It had to allow Strasser, Goebbels and the crank Feder to beguile the masses with the cry that the National Socialists were truly 'socialists' and against the money barons. On the other hand, money to keep the party going had to be wheedled out of those who had an ample supply of it. Throughout the latter half of 1931, says Dietrich, Hitler 'traversed Germany from end to end, holding private interviews with prominent [business] personalities.' So hush-hush were some of these meetings that they had to be held 'in some lonely forest glade. Privacy,' explains Dietrich, 'was absolutely imperative; the press must have no chance of doing mischief. Success was the consequence.'\" \n\n- William L.

His notions of Prussian socialism influenced Nazism and the Conservative Revolutionary movement.\"\n\n>Historian Ishay Landa has described the nature of 'Prussian socialism' as decidedly capitalist. For Landa, Spenger strongly opposed labor strikes, trade unions, progressive taxation or any imposition of taxes on the rich, any shortening of the working day, as well as any form of government insurance for sickness, old age, accidents, or unemployment. At the same time as he rejected any social democratic provisions, Spengler celebrated private property, competition, imperialism, capital accumulation, and 'wealth, collected in few hands and among the ruling classes'. Landa describes Spengler's 'Prussian Socialism' as 'working a whole lot, for the absolute minimum, but \u2014 and this is a vital aspect \u2014 being happy about it.'\"\n\nHere's why they lied they were socialists (TL;DR capitalists weren't very popular following WWI and a major capitalist crisis):\n\n>Juxtaposing the two elements of Spengler\u2019s worldview, a market economy geared towards national greatness, we get a political combination which should objectively be termed \u201cnational capitalism,\u201d or, maybe, \u201cPrussian imperialism.\u201d \n\n>Socialism in any meaningful sense just does not come into it at all. In fact, socialism is precisely that which is expurgated at both levels: at the  economic sphere since it impedes growth, and at the \u201cgreat\u201d political sphere since it posits peaceful international coexistence, which would make  impossible the Spenglerian endorsement of imperialism.\n\n>Socialism is but the traitor that must be  driven out of the fortress. We can now understand why Spengler himself, in his later years, explicitly took the air out of his former \u201csocialism\u201d: \u201cHere a great education is necessary, which I have called Prussian and small politics might be called \u2018socialistic\u2019\u2014what do words matter!\u201d (210). \n\n>But why did Spengler, being for all practical purposes a capitalist, use the term socialism in the first place? Why couldn\u2019t he have just brandished a project of \u201cPrussian Imperialism,\u201d which would have represented his views infinitely better than the banner of \u201cPrussian  Socialism\u201d? It is not difficult to guess the answer, unless one is straightjacketed by an approach that construes fascists as forthright. Capitalism had scarce little popular appeal after the First World War and amidst protracted world economic crisis. A much better prospect for supporters of capitalism lay in feigning to embrace socialism, so as to infiltrate it inside an ideological and political Trojan horse and defeat it from within.\"\n\n- \"Sorceror's Apprentice\", Ishay Landa, 2010, pages 69-70",

Both Hitler and Stalin were totalitarian and Stalin was pretty much as far left as you get while Hitler At most were an economic centrist. Feel like people are forgetting that Stalin and Hitler entered into ww2 on the same side, there's no way that Stalin would have joined Hitler if he were an ultra capitalist. I mean a lot of Hitlers hate towards jews stemmed from his anti capitalistic views. I mean he blamed the jews for Germany's poor financial situation post ww1 and deliberately targeted their businesses during the kristallnacht. So the question isn't about being right or left. The question is about totalitarianism. Saying that the American left is closer to Hitler economically speaking is nothing but factually correct as even leftist Americans are so far right of most European countries that it's downright ridiculous. So how about instead of debating who's closer to Hitler, maybe fix your sad excuse for a first world country. How about getting some universal health care and free college? But then again, that's something Hitler as a centrist would have wanted for his people.. Meh, you'll sort it out eventually.",

          "text": "Germany nationalized healthcare before Hitler was even born (oldest public healthcare system in the world). Nazis banned women from institutions of higher learning (universities). Free college, no doubt.\n\n>After this confession of his belief in the superior race of factory-owners and directors, Hitler went on to declare that rentability must always be the standard of the industry (how differently Gregor Strasser thought on this point!), and when Otto Strasser contradicted him and praised the autarchy of a nationalist economist system, Hitler abruptly interrupted him and said: \"That is nothing more than wretched theorism and dilettantism. Do you really believe that we can ever separate ourselves from international trade and finance? On the contrary, our task is to undertake an immense organization of the whole world in which each land shall produce what it requires most and in which the white race -- the Nordic race -- shall take the leading part in administering and carrying out this vast plan. Believe me, National Socialism would not be worth anything if it were to be confined to Germany and did not secure the rule of the superior race over the whole world for at least one or two thousand years.\n\n>At this point Gregor Strasser, who had been listening to the discussion, declared that economic autarchy must unquestionably be the aim of National Socialism. Hitler beat a retreat. Yes, he agreed that autarchy must be the ultimate objective in, say, a century. Today, however, it was impossible to cut loose from the international economic system. Once again Strasser let fall the word \"Socialism.\" Hitler replied: \"The word 'Socialism' is in itself a bad word. But it is certainly not to be taken as meaning that industry must be socialized, and only to mean that it could be socialized if industrialists were to act contrary to the national interests. As long as they do not do that it would be little short of a crime to destroy the existing economic system.\"\n\nLet's see Nazi policies, not just what they said:\n\n>Incidentally, this also shows that the instruments used to induce private industry to undertake war-related productions and investments could be very similar on both sides of the front. That in turn can be viewed as a piece of indirect evidence for the fact that the economies Germany and the Western Allies still were quite similar, as they all were basically capitalist. The foregoing analysis again proves that in the Nazi period enterprises continued to shape their actions according to their expectations and that the state authorities not only tolerated this behavior, but bowed to it by adapting their contract offers to the wishes of industry. That is also confirmed by Tooze, who argues that there was no 'Stalinist option' available to the Nazi regime and consequently 'a mixture of incentives provided by the state with private economic motives' was decisive for the development of certain sectors of production.\n\n- source: http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/files/capitalisback/CountryData/Germany/Other/Pre1950Series/RefsHistoricalGermanAccounts/BuchheimScherner06.pdf\n\nLet's see why every single conservative party in the Reichstag unanimously voted for Hitler's Enabling Act:\n\n>The domestic agenda was one of authoritarian conservatism, with a pronounced distaste for parliamentary politics, high taxes, welfare spending and trade unions. The international outlook of German business, on the other hand, was far more \u2018liberal\u2019 in flavour. Though German industry was by no means averse to tariffs, the Reich industrial association strongly favoured a system of uninhibited capital movement and multilateralism underpinned by Most Favoured Nation principles.\" \n\n- Adam Tooze, \"The Wages of Destruction: The Making and Breaking of the Nazi economy\"",

You contradict yourself.\n\n(Stalin called the SPD \"social fascists\" and refused to work with them. SPD itself campaigned against communists, fascists and reactionary conservatives (famous Three Arrows or \"Drei Pfeile\").)\n\n\n>The domestic agenda was one of authoritarian conservatism, with a pronounced distaste for parliamentary politics, high taxes, welfare spending and trade unions. The international outlook of German business, on the other hand, was far more \u2018liberal\u2019 in flavour. Though German industry was by no means averse to tariffs, the Reich industrial association strongly favoured a system of uninhibited capital movement and multilateralism underpinned by Most Favoured Nation principles.\"\n\n\n- Adam Tooze \"The Wages of Destruction: The Making and Breaking of the Nazi Economy\"\n\n\nNote that Adam Tooze is a professor, someone with a degree in economics, a doctorate in economic history and this book won a prize and has been reviewed and cited by other historians.\n\n\nThere's no spin here. I wonder which party in the US supports these measures. If you want, I can go over many other policies the Nazis supported and instituted and enforced and mandated to show you why conservatives all voted for them.",

His notions of Prussian socialism influenced Nazism and the Conservative Revolutionary movement.\"\n\n>Historian Ishay Landa has described the nature of 'Prussian socialism' as decidedly capitalist. For Landa, Spenger strongly opposed labor strikes, trade unions, progressive taxation or any imposition of taxes on the rich, any shortening of the working day, as well as any form of government insurance for sickness, old age, accidents, or unemployment. At the same time as he rejected any social democratic provisions, Spengler celebrated private property, competition, imperialism, capital accumulation, and 'wealth, collected in few hands and among the ruling classes'. Landa describes Spengler's 'Prussian Socialism' as 'working a whole lot, for the absolute minimum, but \u2014 and this is a vital aspect \u2014 being happy about it.'\"\n\nBasically right-wing libertarian rhetoric.",

In the first five years of the regime, convictions under section 218 increased by 50%, while birth control centers were shut down and access to contraception was curtailed. During World War II, the Nazis called for the death penalty for repeat offenders against section 218. While the Nazis imposed a very strict anti-abortion scheme for healthy 'Aryans,' they allowed and encouraged abortion if either of the parents was believed to carry hereditary defects. The Nazis further undermined family planning by strictly enforcing existing prohibitions on the display and advertising of contraception. On May 26, 1933, the Nazis re-introduced the prohibitions on publicity or education regarding abortion or abortifacients that had been abolished during the Weimar Republic.

For Landa, Spenger strongly opposed labor strikes, trade unions, progressive taxation or any imposition of taxes on the rich, any shortening of the working day, as well as any form of government insurance for sickness, old age, accidents, or unemployment. At the same time as he rejected any social democratic provisions, Spengler celebrated private property, competition, imperialism, capital accumulation, and 'wealth, collected in few hands and among the ruling classes'. Landa describes Spengler's 'Prussian Socialism' as 'working a whole lot, for the absolute minimum, but \u2014 and this is a vital aspect \u2014 being happy about it.'\n\nSeems awfully familiar, doesn't it?",

The German state was well at work in German-Namibia under the Kaiser setting up extermination camps to prepare land under the \"room to grow\" mantra for the German people. It was done in secret but there are a few discourses like The Kaiser's Holocaust: Germany's Forgotten Genocide and the Colonial Roots of Nazism by David Olusoga and Casper Erichsen. There is a free BBC documentary on it on youtube. One of the pioneers of those Namibian camps took his son, then 10yrs old, who would later go on to architect the same system for the Nazis. It all fizzled out though when the German public became aware after a newspaper broke the story of the camps. The public backlash and outrage simply informed the government that in the future things like this would have to be kept from the people.",

In the sphere of their own firms they were now the undisputed leaders, empowered as such by the national labour law of 1934.

It meshed all too neatly with the concept of Unternehmertum (entrepreneurial leadership) that had become increasingly fashionable in business circles, as an ideological counterpoint to the interventionist tendencies of trade unions and the Weimar welfare state.\n\n>In material terms, the consequences of demobilization made themselves felt in a shift in bargaining power in the workplace. In effect, the new regime froze wages and salaries at the level they had reached by the summer of 1933 and placed any future adjustment in the hands of regional trustees of labour... this [can be] taken as an unambiguous expression of business power, since the nominal wage levels prevailing after 1933 were far lower than those in 1929.\"\n\n - Adam Tooze, \"The Wages of Destruction: The Making and Breaking of the Nazi Economy\"",

          "text": ">Hitler instead launched into a general survey of the political situation. As in his national address on 1 February, his central theme was the turning point in German history marked by the defeat and revolution of 1918. The experience of the last fourteen years had shown that \u2018private enterprise cannot be maintained in the age of democracy\u2019. Business was founded above all on the principles of personality and individual leadership. Democracy and liberalism led inevitably to Social Democracy and Communism. After fourteen years of degeneration, the moment had now come to resolve the fatal divisions within the German body politic. Hitler would show no mercy towards his enemies on the left. It was time \u2018to crush the other side completely\u2019.\"\n\n - Adam Tooze, \"Wages of Destruction\"",

          "text": "The 25-point Program of the NSDAPEdit\n\nWe demand the union of all Germans to form the Greater Germany on the basis of the people's right to self-determination enjoyed by the nations.\n\nWe demand equality of rights for the German people in its dealings with other nations; and abolition of the peace treaties of Versailles and St. Germain.\n\nWe demand land and territory (colonies) for the sustenance of our people and colonization for our superfluous population.\n\nNone but members of the nation may be citizens of the state. None but those of German blood, whatever their creed may be. No Jew, therefore, may be a member of the nation.\n\nWhoever has no citizenship is to be able to live in Germany only as a guest and must be regarded as being subject to foreign laws.\n\nThe right of voting on the state's government and legislation is to be enjoyed by the citizen of the state alone. We demand therefore that all official appointments, of whatever kind, shall be granted to citizens of the state alone. We oppose the corrupting custom of parliament of filling posts merely with a view to party considerations, and without reference to character or capability.\n\nWe demand that the state be charged first with providing the opportunity for a livelihood and way of life for the citizens. If it is impossible to nourish the total population of the State, then the members of foreign nations (non-citizens) must be excluded from the Reich.\n\nAll immigration of non-Germans must be prevented. We demand that all non-Germans, who have immigrated to Germany since 2 August 1914, be required immediately to leave the Reich.\n\nAll citizens of the state shall be equal as regards rights and obligations.\n\nThe first obligation of every citizen must be to productively work mentally or physically. The activity of individual may not clash with the interests of the whole, but must proceed within the framework of the whole for the benefit for the general good. We demand therefore:\n\nAbolition of unearned (work and labour) incomes. Breaking of debt (interest)-slavery.\n\nIn consideration of the monstrous sacrifice of life and property that each war demands of the people, personal enrichment due to a war must be regarded as a crime against the nation. Therefore, we demand ruthless confiscation of all war profits.\n\nWe demand nationalization of all businesses which have been up to the present formed into companies (trusts).\n\nWe demand that the profits from wholesale trade shall be shared out.\n\nWe demand an expansion on a large scale of old age welfare.\n\nWe demand the creation of a healthy middle class and its conservation, immediate communalization of the great warehouses and their being leased at low cost to small firms, the utmost consideration of all small firms in contracts with the State, county or municipality.\n\nWe demand a land reform suitable to our needs, provision of a law for the free expropriation of land for the purposes of public utility, abolition of taxes on land and prevention of all speculation in land.\n\nWe demand struggle without consideration against those whose activity is injurious to the general interest. Common national criminals, usurers, profiteers and so forth are to be punished with death, without consideration of confession or race.\n\nWe demand substitution of a German common law in place of the Roman Law serving a materialistic world-order.\n\nThe state is to be responsible for a fundamental reconstruction of our whole national education program, to enable every capable and industrious German to obtain higher education and subsequently introduction into leading positions. The plans of instruction of all educational institutions are to conform with the experiences of practical life. The comprehension of the concept of the state must be striven for by the school [Staatsb\u00fcrgerkunde] as early as the beginning of understanding. We demand the education at the expense of the state of outstanding intellectually gifted children of poor parents without consideration of position or profession.\n\nThe state is to care for the elevating national health by protecting the mother and child, by outlawing child-labor, by the encouragement of physical fitness, by means of the legal establishment of a gymnastic and sport obligation, by the utmost support of all organizations concerned with the physical instruction of the young.\n\nWe demand abolition of the mercenary troops and formation of a national army.\n\nWe demand legal opposition to known lies and their promulgation through the press. In order to enable the provision of a German press, we demand, that: a. All writers and employees of the newspapers appearing in the German language be members of the race;b. Non-German newspapers be required to have the express permission of the state to be published. They may not be printed in the German language;c. Non-Germans are forbidden by law any financial interest in German publications or any influence on them and as punishment for violations the closing of such a publication as well as the immediate expulsion from the Reich of the non-German concerned. Publications which are counter to the general good are to be forbidden. We demand legal prosecution of artistic and literary forms which exert a destructive influence on our national life and the closure of organizations opposing the above made demands.\n\nWe demand freedom of religion for all religious denominations within the state so long as they do not endanger its existence or oppose the moral senses of the Germanic race. The Party as such advocates the standpoint of a positive Christianity without binding itself confessionally to any one denomination. It combats the Jewish-materialistic spirit within and around us and is convinced that a lasting recovery of our nation can only succeed from within on the framework. THE COMMON INTEREST OVER INDIVIDUAL INTEREST[13]\n\nFor the execution of all of this we demand the formation of a strong central power in the Reich. Unlimited authority of the central parliament over the whole Reich and its organizations in general. The forming of state and profession chambers for the execution of the laws made by the Reich within the various states of the confederation. The leaders of the Party promise, if necessary by sacrificing their own lives, to support by the execution of the points set forth above without consideration.\n\nThat's their party program. They oandered to as many people as possible so had both right and left wing talking point. The NSDAP had a right and a left party wing the thing is that Hitler belonged to the right wing of the party and murdered most people who disagreed with him. \n\n\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Socialist_Program",

It had to allow Strasser, Goebbels and the crank Feder to beguile the masses with the cry that the National Socialists were truly 'socialists' and against the money barons. On the other hand, money to keep the party going had to be wheedled out of those who had an ample supply of it. Throughout the latter half of 1931, says Dietrich, Hitler 'traversed Germany from end to end, holding private interviews with prominent [business] personalities.' So hush-hush were some of these meetings that they had to be held 'in some lonely forest glade. Privacy,' explains Dietrich, 'was absolutely imperative; the press must have no chance of doing mischief. Success was the consequence.'\"\n\n - William L. Shirer",

At the same time as he rejected any social democratic provisions, Spengler celebrated private property, competition, imperialism, capital accumulation, and 'wealth, collected in few hands and among the ruling classes'. Landa describes Spengler's 'Prussian Socialism' as 'working a whole lot, for the absolute minimum, but \u2014 and this is a vital aspect \u2014 being happy about it.'\"\n\nThis is all basically Republican rhetoric and what Republicans believe in.",

          "text": ">Spengler's Prussian socialism was popular amongst the German political right, especially the revolutionary right who had distanced themselves from traditional conservatism. His notions of Prussian socialism influenced Nazism and the Conservative Revolutionary movement.\n\n>Historian Ishay Landa has described the nature of 'Prussian socialism' as decidedly capitalist. For Landa, Spenger strongly opposed labor strikes, trade unions, progressive taxation or any imposition of taxes on the rich, any shortening of the working day, as well as any form of government insurance for sickness, old age, accidents, or unemployment. At the same time as he rejected any social democratic provisions, Spengler celebrated private property, competition, imperialism, capital accumulation, and 'wealth, collected in few hands and among the ruling classes'. Landa describes Spengler's 'Prussian Socialism' as 'working a whole lot, for the absolute minimum, but \u2014 and this is a vital aspect \u2014 being happy about it.'\n\nSounds awfully familiar\n\n>Juxtaposing the two elements of Spengler\u2019s worldview, a market economy geared towards national greatness, we get a political combination which should objectively be termed \u201cnational capitalism,\u201d or, maybe, \u201cPrussian imperialism.\u201d \n\n>Socialism in any meaningful sense just does not come into it at all. In fact, socialism is precisely that which is expurgated at both levels: at the  economic sphere since it impedes growth, and at the \u201cgreat\u201d political sphere since it posits peaceful international coexistence, which would make impossible the Spenglerian endorsement of imperialism.\n\n>Socialism is but the traitor that must be  driven out of the fortress. We can now understand why Spengler himself, in his later years, explicitly took the air out of his former \u201csocialism\u201d: \u201cHere a great education is necessary, which I have called Prussian and small politics might be called \u2018socialistic\u2019\u2014what do words matter!\u201d (210). \n\n>But why did Spengler, being for all practical purposes a capitalist, use the term socialism in the first place? Why couldn\u2019t he have just brandished a project of \u201cPrussian Imperialism,\u201d which would have represented his views infinitely better than the banner of \u201cPrussian  Socialism\u201d? It is not difficult to guess the answer, unless one is straightjacketed by an approach that construes fascists as forthright. Capitalism had scarce little popular appeal after the First World War and amidst protracted world economic crisis. A much better prospect for supporters of capitalism lay in feigning to embrace socialism, so as to infiltrate it inside an ideological and political Trojan horse and defeat it from within.\"\n\n- \"Sorceror's Apprentice\", Ishay Landa, 2010, pages 69-70",
