Look at someone like Stacy Abrams, she has the same goals as most redditors but shes enacting real change because she has a JD and actually knows the process and works it.

You'll never get a politician to tax wealthy people for instance. Someone who doesn't give a fuck about remaining in power or pleasing the establishment would be the only person able to do it. We need 4-8 years of clean-up at least if we can't have a permanent benevolent dictator situation. \n\nTrump honestly had an opportunity as an outsider but we saw how that went.

Therefore a silent majority of people who are unable to express their visceral distaste is created.\n\nIn these conditions it is quite likely fora that allow such dissent to be expressed will tend to present it prominently, perhaps to become a defining feature depending on the degree of social repression felt by the members.

In that sense it is not precisely productive but does allow harm reduction by venting social distress. Note that by Reddit's terms calls to violence are suppressed and by the nature of the 4chan community calls to action are in vain, therefore antisocial and counter-trains responses will not arise from this or any discussion.",

The number of people affected by their shit is absolutely negligible. \n\nYet I see transposting on a daily basis, as if trains make up 20% of the population and has taken all our jobs and raped all our daughters in the women's bathrooms.",

All of her instagram turned into super woke shit and she had a new gender identity/orientation like every month, dyed her hair funny colors, took slutty pictures, apologized for being white etc.\nMy sister(her mom) finally got fed up, took a notice to what actual school fucking faculty and twitter checkmarks were feeding her. Pulled her out of public school and banned her ass from Twitter, my sister used the pandemic to take the time and reconnect with my niece and parent her properly. She's 16 now, dresses normal, has her natural hair color and has a boyfriend. Her posts are normal teenage fare and not identity politics every 15 minutes. She still has her best friend though, but she's not allowed to hang at her house.",

The spanking that wipes out the dumb little thing you call your playtime. You're in big darn trouble, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can wedgie you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed fartfights, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States PTA and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your dorky bottom off the face of the playground, you little poopypants. If only you could have known what serious punishments your little \"smartypants\" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your goshdarned tongue.
