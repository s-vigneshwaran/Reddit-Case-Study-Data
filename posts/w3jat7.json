These women know that, they prey on it, and take advantage of it\n\nThe guys fuck themselves up even more cause they\u2019re warping their sense of reality, and creating deconstructive addiction pathways and habits, andd they\u2019ll feel guilty and shameful with the amount of time and money spent on these ladies, once the ladies move on or ignore them or showcase their bfs or get too big to reply or whatever. Maybe connections go on for a long time but I can\u2019t imagine it forever lol",
