A laptop was a brilliant move on the part of the Republican operative who created the conspiracy theory, I've got to hand it to them. They're able to claim anything and everything is on the hard drive. Hell, there could be information related to the JFK assassination, or pictures of Thomas Jefferson sleeping with Sally Hemmings, or, or, material that could lead to Hillary's arrest! You'll never hear Republicans stretch the limits of their brain cells like they do when they try to explain why Hunter needs to be locked up, \"like forever!\" And I'm always like, \"yeah, cool, so why did Kushner enter the Whitehouse and immediately start trying to establish a back channel for communication between Cheeto Mussolini and Putin? What was that about?\"",
