I'd argue that these are timeless and self-evident facts, that need no \"research from 50 years\" ago to support them. How do you find it helpful to state them as depending on such? The enemy **does not agree** with you, me, or the \"research\".\n\n\"It's ignorance, not a disagreement.\"\n\n2. Who's ignorance? The enemy?\n\n3. I don't understand your distinction here, people who are ignorant of things are in disagreement with people who are not. They will certainly say as much themselves.\n\n\"If using language in the correct way\"\n\n4. My entire point is that this is misusing language, i.e. there is not the required agreement on what the words \"woman/women/female/men/male/man\" refer to, be it gender or sex, so it is **not correct in all contexts** to make the statement \"transwomen are women\", whereas \"transpeople are people\" has no such downside, and finally that that downside is extremely detrimental to the cause itself.\n\n\"is over the line where is the line?\"\n\n5. IDK what this means. If I were to mention a \"line\" here for a catchphrase/slogan to champion these very important ideals, it would be \"unimpeachably true in all applications and contexts\".",

The only thing we can do for the former is obvious and awful, but the latter we must attempt to make it as easy as possible for them to correct themselves. I'm saying that it's really easy to champion \"transpeople are people\" vs other less \"easy for them\" slogans.   \n\n\n4. It absolutely is saying that \"they are people, human beings, and deserve the respect and equal rights as all other people\". \n\n\"Only the most inhuman bastard would say that transpeople aren't people, but they would deny their gender.\"  \n\n\n6. The enemy is just such \"inhuman bastard\\[s\\]\". They exist. They will even tell you directly to your face, that they are so. No?\n\n\"Transwomen are women\" is making a statement about said gender.\"\n\n7. This is the whole crux of the problem here, that it is not clear that \"women/woman/female\" refers to \"gender only\" and not \"gender or sex or somehow both\". You'd need to get agreement that \"women/woman\" **does not ever** refer to sex and **only** to gender, and it's clear that consensus does not exist, even among non-enemy people I was saying.  \n\n\n\"If we took this attitude that the language doesn't need to change because people can interpret it differently,\"\n\n8. This appears to be the exact literal opposite of what I am saying. \n\n  \n\"it would still be acceptable to call black people the N word\"\n\n6.

Hard disagree. Also, no idea what you mean: Anyone ever addressing a human being as \"the \\[n\\] word\" is wholeheartedly aiding the enemy, if not outright advocating on their behalf.",

If the latter, then this is my point: What is wrong with \"transpeople are people\" as a war-slogan? It's true backwards and forwards, it unimpeachably makes the point, and has no baggage of inherently offending otherwise rational people. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>When you get upset at pronouns and things\n\n2. Me? I've never been upset at something so irrelevant as what personal pronouns a human being prefers to be addressed by. Who are you talking about in relation to this OP or thread? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> think about meeting a new person and they tell you \u201cI\u2019m picking the pronouns I refer to you as, regardless of your protest, and I\u2019m also going to call you Bob because that name suits you better.

What you are describing sounds like piece of shit behavior. Is someone advocating for people to be pieces of shit? Where?",

It has nothing to do with my agreement, the statement is not true in all contexts as written. This is a factual issue with championing it as the main slogan for equal and diverse rights.\n\n6. Your first sentence is literally about \"semantics\", as all of this is, especially when championing catchphrases. \n\n7.
