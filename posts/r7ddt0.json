Though there are differences within different EU countries with regards to speed limits, necessity to change to winter tires, necessity to have a fire extinguisher etc., in general it's pretty harmonized since our driving licenses have equivalent value (they can not force me to re-take an exam or something). So we have to know how to get through any traffic situation. \n\nFor example, I didn't come across a single tram until I moved to Germany from my home country of Slovakia. I wasn't dumbfounded (and killed) by it lol, because I still extensively learned about it. \n\nObviously, you won't be able to get much practical experience (apart from a simulator) if it doesn't exist anywhere near where you are taking your driving license but at least you are theoretically taught about literally everything regarding traffic. \n\nHow tragic would it be if an EU country with perhaps newer road system in cities etc. was just giving out driving licenses all willy-nilly and it's citizens dying on every vacation they take outside of it lol.",

They didn't even take me out on the road. This was 15 years ago.

And in true fashion they're not going to educate themselves on an unknown thing.\n\nSame thing with a yield sign. This is apparently the most confusing sign there is. And it's because nobody knows what the fuck yield means. And they don't bother to look it up.",

They do have standard things that are included, like parallel parking, merging, etc, but there are locations around the US without a roundabout anywhere feasibly close to testing centers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: I'm also curious if you don't mind sharing - does this mean your country has only the written test and no practical application?

After that's done you take a theoretical test where you have to score 22 out of 26 to pass and then a practical exam where you go around in traffic with a police examiner who scores you and either fails you or gives a pass depending on if you broke some rules or not(and how many times, for example forgetting to turn your blinkers on once is not an instant fail but if you keep failing to turn them on when needed is a fail or failing to stop at a stop sign or give priority is an instant fail).",

                      "text": "Additionally-- I find this can be one of the most amazing things about humanity.\n\n\nA bit of a long story explaining what I mean... summary is at bottom.\n\n\nA few years back I lived in a large apartment complex (multiple buildings in enclosed area) outside of campus. They ended up locking the main gate (welding it shut...) that literally attached to the campus main path (intentional design). From what I was told when asking the site managers, apparently it was due to large amounts of complaints from a very vocal minority of non student-residents. They were getting annoyed at the minor traffic clogging with students walking from their apartments to this campus-access gate... \n\n\nAnyway, this left us with 1 much smaller gate that opened out a giant mud puddle stretching about 30 - 50 feet before reaching the main campus path. It wanst much of an issue during the summer, but anytime it rained or during the winter-- it was horrendous. Your shoes would sink into even the most solid areas, and some of them were actually full on 6 inch deep puddles (essentially).\n\n\nThis, is where my story becomes relevant to the post. It was during this time I saw what might just be the most amazing thing about humanity. Group mentality and collectively working together- despite no actual coordination or communication. For weeks no changes were made and we all suffered walking sometimes miles around campus with shoes completely soaked and covered in mud. One day, one person brings out some damn throw away cardboard from a box or something. After this, slowly but surely people were bringing some scraps and trash etc to help make an actual pathway through this mud. Every 3 days or so some new large object would appear. At some point someone brought a large plank of wood, but this was really non functional as it would teeter in the mud and splash you. Later i brought some stepping stones to create a path through the roughest section (but they were quite small and were really awkward to cross). One day someone actually combined the 2 and made 2 pillars out of the stones, so the board could be balanced and get you across the worst of it with no trouble. \n\n\nIt was in this that I saw one of (in my mind) the best traits humans have. It can result in some really ridiculous results (such as originally emphasized by the person you replied to), but to me it is beautiful even if it can have terrible results. It shows how and why we formed civilizations- it shows what makes humans able to accomplish so much. It gives me faith that I have never otherwise had. It shows (in my mind) the connection we all share, and a collective desire to fix the problems with the world. Even moreso it shows to me how just doing something little, can truly change things--- specifically because of this human behavior. All because one person started it, and monkey see monkey do.",

This does not apply:\n>\n>* if the right of way is specially regulated by traffic signs (sign 205, 206, 301, 306); or\n* \nto vehicles entering the road from an earth track or forest path.\n>\n> \n> ***(1a) If, at the approach to a roundabout, sign 215 (roundabout) is placed below sign 205 (give way), traffic on the roundabout has the right of way. Use of the direction indicators is not permitted when entering such a roundabout.***\n>\n>\n>(2) A person who has to give way must clearly and in good time show, by means of appropriate driving behaviour, especially by reducing their speed, that they are going to wait. They may only proceed if they can see that they will neither endanger nor substantially impede a road user who has the right of way. If they are unable to see this because the intersection or junction has limited visibility, they may carefully advance onto the intersection or junction until they have a clear view. Nor must a road user who is obliged to give way substantially impede a road user who has the right of way when the latter turns into the other road.\n\nSo the question is... How often is 215 below 205? In the US? Always, because it makes ***no sense to stop a roundabout for incoming traffic***. The whole point is that it makes traffic expedient and efficient. People on the roundabout stopping to let people on would literally slow it all down to the point that it's not workable.\n\nSounds to me like the wording, at least in germany, really tends to prefer you not just stop and let people on. It doesn't even make sense to do that under normal conditions. Yes, right-side traffic might normally have right of way, but a roundabout doesn't really make sense with that - at all, like *period.*\n\nEdit: \n\nSo we're clear, everything I've found says 215 is below 205 in germany for roundabouts. \n\n[The roundabout sign (sign 215) is always posted before the start of a roundabout, underneath the \"yield\" sign (sign 205). This indicates the traffic entering a roundabout must yield to the traffic already moving in the roundabout. Inside the roundabout, there are no extra signs.](https://driversed.com/trending/which-states-require-drivers-ed/) For example. In fact the \"give way sign\" below the \"rotary sign\" looks an awful lot, to me an American, like \"yield to the fucking rotary\" because that's what those mean here.",

The purpose of these is that someone coming from a side road, should not impede the traffic on a main road. it gives a \"hierarchy\" of roads. \n\n\nIn 99.999% of the cases, roundabouts in Europe are the way you describe them, but that is because in 99.9999% of the cases [this is](https://c8.alamy.com/comp/CR40W5/traffic-signs-give-way-on-a-roundabout-dortmund-ruhr-area-north-rhine-CR40W5.jpg) how roundabouts are signed. The \"yield\" signs are always present.\n\n\nAnd the reason the yield signs have to be present there, is because if they aren't, no hierarchy is established, therefore the default of such a traffic situation without such signs is that the roundabout itself and the road coming into it are of equal position.. Meaning the way you decide who goes first in such a situation is the [\"priority to the right\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_to_the_right) rule. \n\nWhich brings us to the conclusion of: Without the yield sign, in a situation where there is a  car A currently driving on the roundabout and a car B driving into the roundabout, car A will have car B to it's right, therefore car A will have to stop and let the car A come onto the roundabout.\n\n\nBut again, I personally have not encountered such a roundabout yet.... Roundabouts simply need to have that  yield sign.",

The only issue we have now is people who come to a complete stop with no oncoming traffic.",

That gives the yielder opportunity to merge on the roundabout. Don't be like: dude I'm going straight so I don't have the signal right! Disclaimer you can't go straight on a roundabout without hitting whatever is at the center of the roundabout. And people on the other side of the roundabout have no time to see which car came from where. \n\nAlso less important but good advice: don't signal left like hey man don't hit me im staying on the roundabout for some extended time. People mostly think it's good form and they are being polite as in so the person trying to merge on the roundabout knows he can't enter it yet. But mostly what people think is. Oeh shiny blinker he is exiting the round about so I can merge. This iirc is illegal in Germany. You can only signal to exit the roundabout and not to continue on it. \n\nThe only time I use the left blinker is if I wait to merge on the roundabout and there is a traffic jam going from 9 o'clock to 3 O clock on the roundabout. Say there is a railway crossing just after the 3 o'clock exit and cars are waiting till the Poles go up.\n\nI will blink left so the line of cars can create a gap so I can intersect them turn to 9 o'clock.",

On this road there is a white diamond shaped sign with yellow border. Telling you that people merging onto this road have to yield to you.\n\nThe other roads merging with the right of way road will have inverted white triangle signs with a red border telling them. Yield to traffic on road you are about to merge with. Also on the road itself there will be what's called shark teeth. Inverted white triangles telling us yield to all drivers on this road. Cars, bicycles, scooters etc. \n\nI believe we have the most traffic rules and signs in the entire world.",

Got my license the same day.  No parallel parking, no left turns, no backing into a spot...very simple.  \n\nAnd *I'm the one* who knows 'yield' doesn't mean 'stop.'  Incredible.",

Probably having many cyclists and not just pedestrians helped with that choice as well. Plus a dense country, this takes less space than a single road widening in 2x2 in front of traffic lights and then merge back to 1 after again. And what's better having just 1 in place, [add another next to it](https://i.imgur.com/Wx6dkQb.jpeg) \nObviously not like that Swindon thing. \n\nEdit: In the past there was [an interactive map](https://i.imgur.com/T82sgr3.png) that had almost all roundabouts in the world in its database, [but It's not there anymore](https://labs.mapbox.com/bites/00205/#2.18/27.76/20.73)\n\nI am fan of so called ['turbo roundabouts'](https://i.imgur.com/z90Qw1s.jpg) which are mostly located on 80\u00a0km/100kmh roads and perfect to pass by some trucks or slow tourists at that point in particular because this is right [before that roundabout](https://i.imgur.com/1GxuJ8m.jpeg) You see drivers swerving because they rather watch the sea and a lake than the road. Then again, I look at mountains when abroad ;)",

Are you saying you think roundabouts were only introduced in the Netherlands in the *1990s*?? \n\nThat doesn't sound right at all. The first roundabout here in the UK was in 1907. You guys really like your roundabouts so I doubt you would have waited that long!",

Just the one, which, of course, has been replaced by another roundabout years ago.\n\nIt's a different world there. I moved to a large country with no cyclists and I love driving here. Sure, it is actually less safe to drive here  (due to bad drivers), but there aren't any pedestrians or cyclists to pay attention to. It is much more relaxing to drive here.",

Roundabouts are not taken at high speeds so it\u2019s fairly easy to estimate wether you have time to merge or not. It\u2019s normal to feel intimidated at first, but you get used to it by the second or third time you use one. They force drivers to think while driving, instead of blindly following what a sign tells you to do, which is a good think because active thinking means you are better at identifying risks and avoiding them than when you are driving absent-mindedly. Statistics also show a drastic reduction in accidents when compared to traffic lights, and there are maybe a handful or deadly roundabout accidents ever, while there have been an innumerable amount of deadly accidents with traffic lights and stop signs since they\u2019ve been created. Traffic lights and stop signs create a dangerous illusion of safety. Roundabouts also lead to lower gas consumption, because you rarely need to come to a full stop while using them.",

To incentivise cycling you want to keep the path as flat as possible because it's harder work going up a hill on a bike. The Netherlands is famously flat, which helps with incentivising people to ride bikes (it's not the sole reason, though). Creating a bridge or a subway underneath the roundabout prioritises the movement of cars and de-prioritises bikes because you're making it harder for cyclists to use the path and easier for cars to use the roundabout.\n\nThe other point I'll engage with is one you made in another comment further down. \n> Incentivising people to cycle is not the same as punishing people in motor vehicles.\n\nUnfortunately, there is only so much space for roads because we need residences, businesses, etc. to make up the rest of the city. We have to make choices over which types of transport we prioritise on those roads. For instance, I live in Melbourne, Aus which prioritises trams on many of its roads. Cars must give way to trams and in some cases perform a special [hook turn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hook_turn) so that trams are better able to move through intersections. \n\nThe reason the city does this is because it better prioritises the movement of *people* rather than vehicles. The same principle applies here. If there are 4 cars backed up at the roundabout, that's 8 people waiting (I'm being generous here, most of those cars will have 1 person in them). There are significantly more than 8 people on bicycles crossing that they're waiting for. This roundabout design prioritises the movement of people, not vehicles. \n\nYou have to make decisions in traffic planning because there just isn't enough space for huge roads with room for everyone. Bikes take up much less space and move more people per square metre, so it makes sense to prioritise them as you get more bang for your buck in road space.\n\nTL;DR: This roundabout moves people, not vehicles. That's what makes it efficient.\n\nEdit: Spelling",

But adding an underpass would not make sense either because of things construction cost, time cost for cyclists vs time saved for cars, area of land used, and I'm probably forgetting some. But long story short, it would only be a good solution if there was no other safe or efficient solution possible.\n\nOne other problem would be that an underpass could flood during heavy rain, which would make the route unusable for cyclists, which can't happen because it is clearly a busy and important commuter route.",

There would've been stationary cars at two entry ways at all time either way, and cyclists waiting too, getting those exact same fumes. \n\nThe purpose of roundabouts is to keep a constant flow of traffic. The ones in Ireland where I am from prioritize cars, the dutch have just prioritized a different means of transport here.\n\nOverhead bike bridges or under road bike  tunnels would be ideal, but costly. They have them on higher speed junctions typically. Motorway exits etc.",

Definitely authoritarian, debatable if it crosses the line into mild fascism. \n\nHe\u2019s pushed government funding to, and stacked laws in favor of, christians, at the expense of Atheists, Jews, Muslims, Sikhs, Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, etc. \n\nHe\u2019s been incredibly anti-LGBTQ+\n\nOn the topic of abortion alone, he has disingenuously threatened people with jail time because they don\u2019t follow his christian view that life begins at conception, despite scientific/medical reality that there is nothing present to indicate, or support the existence, of a person prior to 24-weeks. Remember, arresting folks with different political beliefs is a sign of fascism. \n\n\u2026 and if you look at his politics as a whole, he has definitely embraced a lot of the Christian Dominionist lies/nonsense. \n\n\u2026 and he has pushed for the **arrest** of Dr. Fauci and other medical professionals. \n\n\u2026 and he\u2019s pushed for all the GQP\u2019s political fraud over the 2020 elections to be swept under the rug and ignored. Political cronyism like this is another early sign of fascism. \n\n\u2026 and he\u2019s pushed for anti-tRump political rivals to be arrested. Arresting political rivals \u2014 right there is one of the very indicators of fascism. \n\nI\u2019ll give you that (so far) he\u2019s more of an unAmerican theocrat than a true christofascist, but there is no denying the rest of his politics are beyond vanilla variety authoritarianism and definitely show the signs of early fascism.",

The average New York citizen pays about $1,125 more in federal taxes than they receive in federal funding (Medicaid, Medicare, etc.) compared to the people of Kentucky who receive on average $10,110 more per person in federal payments than they pay in federal taxes. That\u2019s an $11,235 differential.  \n\n>Perhaps the senator from Kentucky would like to thank the generous people of New York and other Democratic Party strongholds for subsidizing the good people of his state. He should at least consider the consequences for our nation and for his state if the largest revenue contributors to the federal government were to, as he suggested, declare bankruptcy and stop contributing to his state\u2019s socialism.",

It's amazing that South Korea isn't the number one victim of heart disease given how much salt they put on native dishes. \n\nI will say this: if you don't like ranch dressing, you will prefer the Korean fried chicken spice profile.

The company that made the video says they *released* it to show how not to use the roundabout, not that that's why it was created.\n\nWhat the construction company claims is not that it was specifically created for that purpose, but that this video is of the roundabout still under construction, with highway personnel directing traffic specifically around the construction. They claimed this *after* the video went viral.\n\n\nAs a video of what not to do, this is terrible. It's not instructive at all, it's not an explanation of what went wrong or the right way to use a roundabout. If you were making a video on how to not use a roundabout, this would be terrible.\n\nIf you already *had* this video and you wanted to press onto people the importance of not being a dumbass in a roundabout, releasing it would be the way to go.\n\nIt's also worth saying that even though the company's claims this is just a result of construction... it *really* doesn't look that way in the video.",

I watched a meeting where the DOT was proposing one at a major intersection where there the traffic was terrible, you sat through maybe 4-5 green light cycles to go through the intersection, and I avoided it like the plague. It was right next to the little downtown area.\n\nThe data / reasoning was really interesting. The short of it was that the intersection caused traffic elsewhere because it was so bad, people would get frustrated and blow the red, and they had many severe accidents and fatalities.\n\nBy putting in the roundabout there would likely be many more accidents, especially for the first few years (I went - whaaaa?) - but they would be very minor and they expected no severe accidents or fatalities.\n\nNow understand that the drivers here can't merge onto a 70MPH highway without coming to a complete stop at the end of a mile long ramp, let alone manage a roundabout.\n\nBut it worked! I can clear the intersection in about 30 seconds average. I've seen a whole bunch of morons get their cars dented up. As far as I know there have been no serious injuries after a year. \n\nAll the shops in town have seen increased traffic (as in people coming into town to shop) because they can actually get there without sitting for hours at the light. The body shop is booming :> If it wasn't for COVID the hospital might be less busy than before.",

You can't cross when it is green because people blow the light all the time on the 4-lane road. The traffic is worse. It does have sensors but there is always a car at the 2-lane so the light is always changing.\n\nWhat reasons would there be to \\*not\\* put a roundabout in? This seemed like the absolute perfect place to put one? Was it the speed limit? Couldn't they just drop the limit 1 mile on each side?\n\nThanks for your AMA :>",

A roundabout requires a slowdown, just like a light, and does not slow the speed to zero unless things get backed up by an inexperienced or confused motorist.  \n\n\nNow, keep in mind I'm not an engineer, I just crunch statistics and massage data mostly. :)",

I find it harder to notice pedestrians myself when they are crossing at the circle so I pay extra attention. I have been nearly rear-ended more than once when I stopped at the circle exit to yield to a pedestrian.\n\nAnd now that I think about it, the increase in minor accidents could really be simply caused by the fact that there are many more cars passing through the intersection on an hourly basis. I'm not sure how many more but I go that way now because it is faster than the detour I used to take.",

              "text": ">\"If you look closely, you can see flaggers directing traffic that way\"\n\nNo, I can't actually... the zoom in shows construction workers milling around, but none of them are directing traffic, and furthermore, there are no visible workers in the direction the cars are coming from, and we can clearly see cars deciding to switch to the left lane immediately before the intersection, without any flagger there to direct them. I presume there probably \\*is\\* a flagger a ways back off camera down each of the directions that stops the traffic so that it only comes from one direction at a time, but the people driving through the intersection seem to be deciding where to drive entirely of their own volition.\n\n>\"The video was used to give people an idea what not to do in a roundabout\"\n\nUh huh... sure... that's why it has a text overlay for the \"construction marketing\" company, and the \"Walker Construction\", but nothing about \"this is what not to do\", no voice over, no text overlay, no other camera angles, just 45 seconds of people clusterfucking through an intersection.\n\n>\"This new video posted Monday afternoon shows the correct way\"\n\nOh, you mean the video that was recorded after they painted solid lines on the road and put up signs telling people how to use the roundabout? Gee, it sure is convenient that they staged the \"what not to do\" video when there were no clear markers or signs, and then waited until they had things that informed drivers where to go to film the \"right way to do it\" video.\n\nHere's what I think happened: They were doing construction, only letting one lane through at a time, and drivers had no idea what to do there because that entire intersection had been replaced... if you're driving down an unpainted road and suddenly see a median that looks like it divides the road into people going left and people going right, I could see people deciding to drive down the left lane to go left. I don't think there's anything wrong with this explanation.\n\nI think what happened is this went viral and the construction company came up with this \"example of the the wrong way\" BS in an effort to save face, especially since they were likely facing \"roundabouts are too confusing\" complaints even before that video came out.",

There is one on the interchange across the river on 265 and 62 in Indiana, but it\u2019s like a weird figure eight exit on ramp roundabout that\u2019s even more confusing (and actually works pretty well now that people are used to it).  There are a handful of super small ones in a few neighborhoods, but they aren\u2019t really handling traffic.  I honestly can\u2019t think of any roundabouts like this in Jefferson county.\n\nAnd yeah, people in KY would definitely struggle the first time dealing with a roundabout.  People from rural areas struggle with one way streets and streets with lanes that open and close at certain times of day when they are driving in the city.  I know a huge number of folks who have no idea how to parallel park.  If all you ever drive in is interstates and backroads then your going to struggle with some more advanced city road stuff.  It\u2019s nothing to do with intelligence, it\u2019s just that Kentucky is largely rural and even our large cities are primarily suburban, if you are never exposed to it you won\u2019t learn to drive that way.\n\nI know a few people from cities who struggle driving in some of the twisty, thin two lane roads in Eastern Kentucky with a cliff on one side and a river on the other.  Locals have no problem going 55 or 65 and whipping through the turns, but city drivers freak out a bit a wind up driving at 30 the whole way and backing up traffic for miles.",

Still, it's a fast way to control traffic, reduce accidents and slow cars to an acceptable speed, if you try speeding like a maniac through a well designed one you'll find yourself rolling like maki sushi or hitting the curb.",

If I rented a car in Germany I'd have to read their highway code to be given it, and possibly even a driving test.\n\nClearly the US system isn't up to scratch if people think that they don't need to read, learn and plan their journeys to be competent drivers.

I feel like if you can understand a pointy sign,even a little, and have common sense, this isn\u2019t hard to understand. So I am in total agreement that a whole lot of people from Ky. have to be inbred or just came off a mountain side. My grandmother never learned to read, she had her first child at 13 years old and yes, she was married. But my goodness, she had common sense until she died at 93. This state has been forgotten, they only have manual labor jobs, that pay a decent wage, and you can get a 40 hour week. Then the government wonder\u2019s why Kentuckians, are getting disability benefits more than any other state. Maybe, it\u2019s because we have worked our bodies in 70 hour work weeks for years, just to have a halfway decent life, and of course, I am sure Mitch and Rand Paul, got at least $180 in taxes for all my overtime every week. Yea, I am physically broken down from working, but the government says it\u2019s our fault for not pursuing an education, so no child left behind means, teachers might have or have not tried to help you, I mean what do they care, they get paid either way, as long as you show up every day, half ass pay attention you will graduate high school. They only get pissed if you don\u2019t show up, then the school loses money. Sorry for the rant, I didn\u2019t mean this to be a blog, but the have and have nots is the only way it\u2019s ever been here, and now when American is watching the rich control everyone, I am kind of surprised that, like really, you haven\u2019t seen this coming?

It's hard to tell which side of the road is the one with the oncoming traffic since I see cars entering and exiting from both sides. This means that either both roads are one way in which case building a roundabout is unnecessary or the drivers are total idiots. As mentioned this roundabout doesn't have the relevant signs. No 20mph limit on roundabouts or yielding to cars oncoming from left side. The purpose of a roundabout is to facilitate speed at the cost of safety when designing a road. There was one roundabout when I was in the UK that had to install traffic lights due to the sheer amount of accidents that was occuring so it made the whole reason for a roundabout unnecessary. It looks like the area around this intersection isn't that highly developed which leads me to believe that this is either a back road or part of a developing gated community's local road due to the excessive extravagance a roundabout entails. In my honest opinion, I'd rather have safety over expediency/speed and believe roundabouts to be an eyesore as the middle circular part of it is unused real-estate. There's nothing in the middle of it where they could put a fountain/memorial/monument/statue/or even a gigantic circular turn-style advertisement. They should incorporate stop signs before entry since drivers who aren't used to roundabouts don't look ahead and gauge the oncoming traffic. Either that or have sensors that blink to alert drivers of oncoming cars/mirrors that show vehicles around the bend in the case of an obstructed roundabout. I guess I'm done ranting.",

But moving left into incoming traffic lanes (notably in contravention of the signage) indicated there are bigger skill/knowledge issues at play.  BTW, they installed this circle to help alleviate the high accident rate at this intersection when it was a traditional 4-way.  What excuse should we give these drivers for their problems dealing with that traffic management method?",
