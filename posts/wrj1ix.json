There are good Christians out there with positive values and something worth listening to.  I am not against it.

Thomas is all about 'states 'rights' which specifically do NOT include the right to restrict interstate travel. Thomas probably gives 0 fucks about abortion- he cares about empowering the states over the federal government except where the Constitution explicitly grants the Federal Government powers. Which is what the text says.\n\nIt's a stupid, outdated and undemocratic view, but it is his view. It was also his opinion that either the states or the Federal Government have the power to enact laws on abortion or most anything else through their representative governments. If Roe had been codified into Federal Law if would have been much harder for him to make the decision to overrule the will the people expressed through their representatives. He still could have, but his reasoning would be stretched so thin you could read through it, so he might have thought better of it.\n\nHowever, other justices have other opinions and I have no doubt that some of them would accept any fig leaf presented to cover a decision to declare a Federal Law to make abortion accessible to the nation unconstitutional. \n\nThe solution to this problem, like so many others with the Court, is to put more justices on the bench to move it closer to the mainstream thinking of the country.",

We have 2 sides who share zero core values. Due to this, they cannot ever be swayed, and neither are any of our future Justices. In these ideological cases, they all already know how they'll rule before they hear the case.

He was for every single option and agreed with all of it. Then the journalist told him that those are the things democrats are asking for, and the guy kinda paused and his whole demeanor changed to being disagreeable. \n\nHe was fine with every single one of the ideas presented to him, until he was told they were democrat ideas, then he seemed to have a problem.",

I very mildly bring up the idea that maybe she wasn't really the moral beacon of goodness that everyone likes to believe she was. Maybe she actually caused tremendous harm and spread terrible ideas just as effectively as she spread pain. I say it better than that but I do get the point across. It ALWAYS hits them with major discomfort and I can tell that they don't even want to approach hearing the subject, let alone talk about it. They can't even entertain the idea that she was not a good person. These are people who don't flinch when talking about almost anything else, religion, politics, people. There is serious confusion about what that women did and what she was all about and its become a very cherished and protected memory for a lot of people and whats strange is they cannot even tell you what they think she did. They don't know anything other than, \"Mother Theresa was an amazing woman and a saint\".",

Now she CAN'T get pregnant ever again \n\n- 10 year old rape victim got pregnant, thankfully got an abortion in a different state...a state which is set to ban abortion itself. [Edit: and both the rape victim and the physician are being doxxed and attacked by state officials]\n\n- court in Florida refuses to grant a teenager an abortion, saying she isn't mature enough \n\n- women have to wait until they are in critical condition before ectopic pregnancies can be terminated \n\n- and now, a woman is going to have to give birth to a fetus which won't have a head. That \"child\" is going to \"live\" for *seconds*. Its \"birth\" and death are going to be the worst thing that anyone in that room will ever see.\n\nI don't know how many dead women it's going to take, but the bodies of would-be mothers are going to start piling up. There are dozens of different conditions which are uniformly fatal to embryos and fetuses; a good chunk of these conditions are also fatal to the mothers if the pregnancy isn't terminated ASAP. \n\nAnd for everyone who thinks, \"this doesn't affect me or the people I know.\" It does. There are over 120,000 ectopic pregnancies in the United States **every year.** There are over 1,000,000 miscarriages and stillbirths in the United States **every year.** You ABSOLUTELY know someone whose pregnancy hasn't worked out. \n\nFuck EVERYONE who supports abortion bans. People will fucking DIE.",

This allowed the right basically the first round of gerrymandering using social media data, allowing perfected gerrymandering. People the idiots, had to basically guess and use general info about an area. \"black people live over there, and rich people live over here.\" it was messy, and not quite as functional.  Now they can draw lines right arround individual addresses. and now a bunch of people perfectly fine with trump trying to literally overthrow the country, who just said they see no problem with trump stealing nuclear weapon secrets(no really.. 43% of the country was fine with that, despite the smoking gun could really be a mushroom cloud) and these people are in charge of elections in many states.\n\nand dont forget every republican accusation is a confesssion. BY Far, it wasnt even close, a super majority of all election fraud arrests for 2020 were trumpers. The media could only find a single instance of a biden voter, voting for a dead relative, but dozens of trumpers.

Before a human being breathes they are simply flesh, not actually a living being.\n\n['the bible tells us when a fetus becomes a living being. '](http://www.thechristianleftblog.org/blog-home/the-bible-tells-us-when-a-fetus-becomes-a-living-being)\n\nGenesis, Job, Ezekiel and Exodus all reinforce this, and Exodus states that the punishment for causing a pregnant woman to miscarry or give birth prematurely is a fine. Punishment for causing a pregnant woman to die is death. It's all laid out if radicals would just read their own bible and follow their doctrine. Then again,  half the Christians I've met have never read the old testament, only the new king james bible... which is pretty sterilized.",

The same goes for the right of choice. You shouldn't be able to force anyone to risk death and bodily harm against their will for the sake of another. The immorality of stripping people of their consent and bodily autonomy should be the hot topic, not religious belief and not science about when life begins.",

You're being flippant about this woman's situation, about others in these situations, and the general excruciating process involved concerning these issues. On top of that, you're telling me to go be emotional somewhere else, dismissing another woman who has been through shit. \"Just go to another hospital,\" isn't helpful. It doesn't add anything.

But Woman\u2019s still said it would not perform the abortion. \n\n**THE HOSPITAL** said no, not the doctors, you know... The people who are responsible for determine if a condition is considered to be \"profound and irremediable congenital or chromosomal anomaly existing in the unborn child that is incompatible with sustaining life after birth in reasonable medical judgment\"\n\nWhich I will repeat aligns with the state laws.\n\nThis is **the hospital** playing the \"we don't want to get sued card\" and chickening out despite the harm it would cause to the person in question.\n\n> In the absence of additional guidance, we must look at each patient\u2019s individual circumstances and remain in compliance with all current state laws to the best of our ability\n\nA little further down in the article you have this quote from a Doctor\n\n> Gambala said that even if hospital attorneys were uncomfortable with giving the go-ahead for an abortion based on the acrania diagnosis, **they could use the broad exception that the state allows for when a fetus is incompatible with life. And acrania, in Gambala's opinion, meets that description**. \n\nSo yes, beyond all shadow of doubt, the hospital deserves quite a lot of blame.  Blame that they can share with the state for enacting anti-abortion laws.\n\nYou see, **doctors** take an oath of \"do no harm\", hospitals take an oath of \"make as much money as possible\".  Fuck this hospital and fuck their lawyers I hope they have recurring nightmares for the rest of their lives.",

A baby can absolutely be alive for days or even potentially weeks with this disorder if provided constant medical care.  So is that \"incompatible with life\" if the baby can be alive with it after birth, even if only for a little while?  Who knows.  The law sure as hell doesn't say one way or the other, as it makes no attempt to clearly define what \"incompatible with life\" means legally for these purposes.\n\nI'm impressed that there are doctors willing to risk the possibility of going to jail to perform a procedure that is in a legal grey area like this, but the hospital is right that this is not clearly legal under this law.",
