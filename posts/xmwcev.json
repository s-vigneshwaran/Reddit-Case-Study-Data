But like, it's frustrating as shit to try to share your culture with people and the only comments you get are from people who know nothing about it but still think they can correct you. Just because I said it's generally accepted doesn't mean I like it, it just means it's been happening. \n\nAnd by \"you people\" I meant \"non-Native\". I see how that sounds now. In my family it usually means \"white people\" which is not really considered offensive since they're the majority, so I forget how it sounds on the Internet.",

Meanwhile, the Czechs also deported all Sudeten Germans at gunpoint and gave their houses to Czechs. The Polish lost their lands in the east, where the Soviets also deported them, but they were compensated for it by simply taking German Silesia and Pomerania and deporting all the Germans there, also at gunpoint. \n\n\n[West Germany actually refused to accept this settlement until 1991](https://i.redd.it/i6yzbxt5hyg01.jpg), when the Allied powers bluntly laid out \"you either accept your permanent loss and move on, or you don't get to reunify with East Germany at all\".",

There's a few different tankie ideologies, but one of the big ones (though still tiny compared to the rest of leftist ideologies) is Stalinism, to give you some idea of how dense these clowns are. Tankies also, despite *technically* supporting socialism, pretty regularly spew racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, xenophobia, etc. on par with the worst among the right-wing.\n\nIt's important to note that they're basically pariahs among the rest of the left. The vast, vast, *vast* majority of  leftist groups oppose authoritarianism in general as a defining core tenet, so we regard tankies with almost as much disdain as we regard Nazis and similar right-wing authoritarians. The main difference being that tankies are way more of a joke.\n\n[Thought Slime and Sophie From Mars have a pretty decent video of them basically just dunking on one of the prominent tankie leaders for like an hour and a half.](https://youtu.be/_rRCUkgOVTc)\n\nTL;DR: Tankies believe in socialism backed by tanks and jackboots, rather than socialism backed by cogent philosophy and the will of the proletariat.",

Over the past almost decade the west has attempted to hold sway over the country, and this has led to the current special military operation that rose out of a frozen conflict in Donbass. It's a conflict of capitalist oligarchs against capitalist oligarchs and only a dope would support putin just because he mentions fighting actual fascist militias. \n\nTaiwan does belong to China, they're a self run island and this reality stems from the fact that China never finished off the opposition forces in its Civil War. \n\nKorea would be unified without the war in the 50s, and there has been movement in the recent past to ease tension on the peninsula and establish closer relations, things which are more successful when the US doesn't try to stop them or stage war games or shit like that. One thing that would help people is lifting the economic siege of the DPRK, but that's unlikely to happen.",

In the late 1800s, blankets from smallpox patients were distributed to Native Americans in order to spread disease. There were several wars, and violence was encouraged; for example, European settlers were paid for each Penobscot person they killed. In the 19th century, 4,000 Cherokee people died on the Trail of Tears, a forced march from the southern U.S. to Oklahoma. In the 20th century, civil rights violations were common, and discrimination continues to this day.\u201d\nNow please don\u2019t do stupid math like subtracting the final tally from the original one, you\u2019re not taking into account the reproduction of humans, so the tally is very high.",

The first was the brutal practices of the Spanish conquistadores, as recorded by the Spanish themselves, most notably by the Dominican friar Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas, whose writings vividly depict atrocities committed on the natives by the Spanish. The second explanation was religious: God had removed the natives as part of His divine plan in order to make way for a new Christian civilization. Many natives of the Americas also understood their troubles in terms of religious or supernatural causes. Scholars now believe that, among the various contributing factors, epidemic disease was the overwhelming cause of the population decline of the American natives.\u201d\nhttps://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/wikispeedia/wpcd/wp/p/Population_history_of_American_indigenous_peoples.htm\nNo matter what I go through I won\u2019t be able to provide an accurate number which is even close to the actual number of people killed by Europeans.\nBecause there\u2019s no way those tyrants would have kept an accurate record of proceedings.\nBut yes what I can say is even after close to 250 years of independence, US of America as a country hasn\u2019t been able to sort out the issue of racial discrimination.\nTells you a lot.",

India's northern lighter skinned people are discriminatory toward the darker people of the south. Then add in all its additional conflicts that will never be solved, such as between its Hindus and Muslims. Then think about the abhorrent, despicable caste system and, don't forget, numerous rapes of women on public transports. Then meditate on the barbaric practice of honor killings.\n\nYou live in the most fragile crystal house, throwing stones at a fiberglass one.",

They never agreed on any permanent borders or nationhood before an even greater killing machine appeared on the horizon.\n\n Even then, instead of forming a united front and resistance, they chose to kill each other instead of the white man, and so one half sided with the white French while the other half (their mortal enemies) sided with the white English.

Not to mention that many of our lines are originally from the British Isles, which isn't in Europe and never has been (according to the people who live there). \n\nEveryone in America is from somewhere else, except as you point out the Native Americans, of which there are few left. It's actually a point of pride for white Americans to know which European county their ancestors are from, and no one wants to be \"just\" American, as everyone else is too and it's not unique.\n\nFor instance, I'm largely Welsh on one side and Scotch-Irish on the other. A girl I knew in college is very proud that her family is 100% German. My wife is Bangladeshi. We all know we're not from here (America) if you trace the line back far enough. My Scotch-Irish side goes back to my great-great [...] great-great grandfather William the Conqueror if you go back far enough.

They still have a centrally planned economy and just have market socialist economic zones in the major cities. Their constitution and 5 year plans specifically mention Marxist-Leninism pretty frequently. Critics argue that they may never fulfill that transition, but they actually have a pretty good track record so far. Vietnam and Cuba are doing quite well these days too. \n\nProbably would get called a tankie or banned for even pointing this stuff out in the first place, but it\u2019s just the facts if you do some reading about it.",

It was mostly for the domestic audience. First, to quell protests and second as a make-work program to keep people happy. Soldiers were used as construction workers to build state projects, similar to the WPA.\n\nThe fact is the world had changed so much by 1950 that an \"empire\" was unnecessary and unsustainable. Why else would Britain give up India? The USSR and the PRC were never in danger of invasion and they knew it (except by each other!).\n\nThe fundamental problem with communism is the lack of price discovery. Usually markets do this with little effort, which is how it's been done naturally for thousands of years (supply and demand). To keep the price of goods down, the USSR and the PRC used strict price controls enforced by a large police force (and military).",

Just look at the militarization of the police in the US recently to see our recent attempts to control the populace. \n\nBritain \u201cgave up\u201d India militarily, much the same way they gave up Hong Kong and Taiwan. They still have a vested economic interest in all those places and still heavily support efforts to destabilize them to keep them under \u201csoft imperial\u201d control (economically). The entire third world has been exploited by the western allies, which is how they got so rich in the first place. \n\nYou can argue all day about how communism can or can\u2019t do some thing necessary in a capitalist system (price discovery, labor value calculation, etc). These don\u2019t matter tbh until discussion of true communism is on the table (aka, the abolition of state post socialism). Socialism can still have markets though so it\u2019s moot point to bring up stuff like that. Communist parties are different from communism. They have the end goal of establishing communism, but everyone knows this is idealistic and the material conditions of the future will help determine what that transition looks like.

It has different first principles which define property in a fundamentally different way (which does not include 'private property' as the liberals know it) such that property hoarding wouldn't even make sense conceptually.\n\nComing from your fundamental misunderstanding of what socialism is, your communism definition really doesn't have a chance.  For example, there is a lot of talk about what you called the \"authoritarian stage\", but it is a theoretical manner of transitioning to communism *from what existed as industrial capitalism at the time* (which was particularly thinking about the feudal, illiberal kind of capitalist state that existed at the time).  It is by no means a required aspect of communism.  Defining communism this way is like defining liberal democracy as being a system of government that requires a time period of a Reign of Terror in which you guillotine the aristocracy just because a lot of liberal thinkers under the aristocracy wrote about how you'd need to behead the king to end the monarchy -- it's absurd to define one system of government entirely upon how its thinkers believe you need to end a different system of government.\n\nIn short, you're defining Socialism by pointing at industrial capitalism and saying \"this is socialism if we just make some small changes\".  It's not.  There are different first principles and that is where you *must* start in understanding a political philosophy.\n\nAnd that's not to even speak of the great breadth of socialist thoughts, including many -- perhaps even most of the ones you will actually interact with -- who believe there's great compatibility between liberal and socialist ideas.\n\n>I also understand that some modern communists have distanced themselves from Marx, due to some of his ideas not aging well.\n\nAbsolutely not true.  Marx's writings criticizing industrial capitalism are honestly proving very sanguine these days, and a lot of people are revisiting him for those insights.  I really, really doubt you will find a modern self-described communist who feels any need whatsoever to distance themselves from Marx.  His prescriptions for *ending* capitalism were lousy.  Any armchair expert who tells you how to start a revolution to fix the world is probably full of shit regardless of their political compass.  But the totality of Marx's work is really excellent and even if you totally disagree with him, it is a great tool for political analysis.\n\nI recommend The Thoughts of Karl Marx by McLellan.  It is a well-written primer intended for western audiences on the materials.  Fairly old, so might even be free online.",

At the same time russia used to hold some of these positions but it lost them due to corrupt officials putting their own gluttony before the state's Imperialistic ambitions, while also living in an illusion that the world wouldnt stand up to its violence due to the nuclear threat. \n\nRussia is currently falling behind in the race as they lost a lot of, ehm idk how to call it so lets go with respect, after the start of the \"military operation\". America is gaining a lot of former russian positions, and china is advancing slowly and silently but steadily due to the patriotism, spying on its own people and their fear from inhumane punishment. 1984 teaches us, however, that in some time this might shift and some other might become the undesired empire.",

And dont get me wrong, as powerful as the west is, we allow it to do what it does, just like we did with the USSR, unlike Hungary 1956, Tito's yugoslavia, east germany and others who at least tried to stand up against the opressor, or plaied the game to their best interest as much as that was possible. Something that Turkey seems to be doing, even though i strongly dislike erdogan's dictatorship and repression. \n\nI fully agree about PCR tho. This is the real threat, that is not taken as serious as it should (imo). The dependancy is growing daily, and even the USA feels it since the start of the covid crysis. \n\nGreat convo btw, but im falling asleep and cant make much sense sadly.

They weren't native as their was people before they came. The Greeks for example. \n\n >Oh and by an imperialistic country known as the Russian Empire\n\nThe Ottoman Empire who the Russians took Crimea off were also imperialistic. \n\n>You thought bringing up Crimea is a gotcha?\n\nI brought up Crimea becusse most people see it's return to Ukraine as righting a wrong against imperialism. My point was Crimea being part of Ukraine is also imperialistic, so it's not righting any wrongs. You are proving my point.",

But if you believe it was inhabited by the Cimmerians, of which there is no proof, it's just an presumption, then you can give it back to them. I mean their descendants are no doubt Greeks... but let's not let that ruin your fun.  \nIt's also presumed they didn't inhabited the regions originally colonised by the Greeks, they inabited the Northern hinterlands but most of Southern part was inhabited by the Greeks which later became the Bosporan Kingdom.",

Also technical South Korea is a puppet of the US, and North Korea is a puppet of Russia, because they are both creations of the Cold War.

They banned slavery in the North, and tried to prevent it from spreading westward. There was even the underground railroad, routes that helped slaves escape from the south and into the north or Canada. The only racists in the US are conservatives who wants to take away the rights from people who aren't from a certain race.\n\nWith the PRC, they wanted communism, and decided to revolt and the government, and force them to flee to Taiwan. And tell me, unless the country is a dictatorship where people cannot choose their leaders, the government owns the media, and their ideology is based on extreme nationalism and racism, then the government isn't fascist.",

The term has since evolved to more generally refer to anti-democratic/pro-authoritarian socialists, though the idea that socialism is compatible with anti-democratic views is an extremely flawed one.\n\nIt's not a synonym, but it's pretty damn close to a nazbol.\n\nAnd just premptively, 'communist' China and the USSR admitted themselves that they were not 'yet' socialist states, they would describe themselves in a transition period that Marx described between revolution and the installation of a socialist society. Unfortunately in both cases the people who filled in the power vacuum to shepherd the 'transition' to socialism quite fancied their position of power and shaped their respective states to protect that power, rather than run society collectively which is the *entire* point of socialism.",

The appeal to racial justice won't work on assorted new immigrants who had nothing to do with colonisation in the 1600s (especially when plenty of these immigrant groups are Jews, Catholic Irish, Dominicans, etc. all people who were victims of some past injustice themselves).\n\nWhen people die, they want their property to be passed onto their children, ownership of property which stays in the family is seen as a way of attaining economic security and stability for many. It's difficult to part ways with the house your parents and yourself grew up in, or to sell the shop that grandpa opened to provide for the family. Unless the offer is deemed suitable in terms of improving their material condition (i.e it's a suitable offer of money).\n\n\nThis maybe more realistic in areas like Montana, Arizona, etc. where settlement was much more recent and sizable American Indian populations still exist, but I don't see assorted Italians or Jews in New York City and New Jersey feeling too inclined to play along with the white guilt.",

According to him, Native Americans finally were finally \"allowed\" to \"legally\" \"own\" land by buying it back from Europeans who claimed it.\n\nBut he wasn't alone - the US Supreme Court also went along with that interpretation:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_doctrine\n\n>> The discovery doctrine, or doctrine of discovery, is a concept of public international law that was promulgated by Christian European monarchies in order to legitimize the colonization and evangelization of lands outside Europe. Between the mid-fifteenth century and the mid-twentieth century, this idea allowed European entities to seize lands inhabited by Indigenous peoples under the guise of \"discovering new land\", meaning land not inhabited by Christians.[1] The concept of terra nullius was a major part of the discovery doctrine, particularly around the Indigenous people of North America. Terra nullius, meaning that land was empty or void,[2] was a justification for European groups to claim that land for their country, despite the many Indigenous groups already present on the continent.[3]\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson_v._M%27Intosh\n\n>> Johnson v. M'Intosh, 21 U.S. (7 Wheat.) 543 (1823), is a landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court that held that private citizens could not purchase lands from Native Americans. As the facts were recited by Chief Justice John Marshall, the successor in interest to a private purchase from the Piankeshaw attempted to maintain an action of ejectment against the holder of a federal land patent.\n\n\n\nThat school also taught things like \n\n* \"natives should be happy that the Europeans colonized them, because before the Europeans came the natives couldn't get into heaven because they didn't know the right god\", and \n* Native Americans should be thankful because the Europeans [improved the climate](https://timeline.com/american-settlers-climate-change-5b7b68bd9064)",

To pretend like every tribe was at war 24/7 in the past is just grossly wrong too and is the kind of shit used to justify the savage Indian trope. \n\nWe aren\u2019t different from other groups of people. Not every group of human in the past was at war with someone. Not every group of humans enjoyed war at all. Some were so peaceful, Columbus just walked in and enslaved them because they couldn\u2019t fight back.",

There are hundreds of Native American tribes in the United States. They are absolutely capable of having this discussion on their own. This line of questioning is as seriously stupid as a bunch of Canadians trying to decided whether Australia should belong to aboriginals or Australians without asking either of them for their input. \n\nIf the United States government was ever at the point where they were considering giving land back to the tribes they stole from, they can talk to those tribes themselves. Excluding tribal entities from these types of conversations is exactly what allows so much injustice to occur at such a constant rate on reservations. You\u2019re never going to come up with an adequate solution just talking to one Native person on the internet. You\u2019re not going to get adequate results talking to anyone on the internet. This is a discussion for governments. \n\nEach tribe has their own rich history and acting like every single one of them fought other people for their land is colonialist nonsense. Having a decent understanding of pre-contact history is enough to understand the flaw in the assumption that it was war 24/7 for everyone. Trans continental trade routes were established, cities existed that became hubs for the trading of materials and knowledge, some of which were larger or equal to those in European countries at the time. Items from South American were traded in North America along vast trade routes. Many tribes intermingled and shared territory. Cahokia, one of the largest cities in North America, was shared by a great number of tribes, including the Osage, of which I am a tribal member of. \n\nSuch complicated networks would simply not be feasible if Turtle Island was plagued with war 24/7 by everyone. There was an immense amount of cooperation between tribes and we still cooperate well today. You could either have a long drawn out Reddit discussion going through the nuances of everything, or you could trust that tribal governments are competent enough to work together to come to an admirable result. I\u2019m certain many, many, many tribal governments today would agree that such a solution would be far better than what they\u2019re stuck with now, even if they have to compromise with each other over a few things.",

A totalitarian government is defined by a few key aspects:\n\n- Extraordinary Power of the leader: Called the \u201c \nSupreme Leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran\u201d\n\n- An exclusionist ideology: I mean\u2026 ya\u2026\n\n- a Single mass party: Iran is a Theocratic State, so there\u2019s not really any room for a party to oppose the state religion\n\n- A secret police: the \u201cMorality Police\u201d\n\n- Monopoly on communications: Iran has literally shut down their internet connections across the country\n\n- Determination to change social values: Quite literally enforcing Shia Islam Law, despite mass protests\n\n- Welfare of the state over welfare of the people: Detaining their own people in order to promote religious values. I\u2019d consider that to be \u201cstate > people\u201d\n\nOn top of that, totalitarian states typically have put in place a cult following/religious forma (sacred books, ceremonies, etc) but since Islam is already in place, that aspect is pretty much taken care of.",

I know this is hard for you to imagine, but Ukrainians clearly prefer closer ties to the EU to remaining a Russian satellite state.\n\n> Taiwan does actually belong to China and they were both having peaceful diplomatic talks up until Pelosi decided to be a bitch and stick her nose into business that has nothing to do with her.\n\nTaiwan wants to remain independent, as numerous referendums and elections in Taiwan illustrate.  The fuck does Pelosi have to do with it?  Taiwanese independence predates her even being in office.\n\n> South Korea deserves to be free from US influence and come to a peaceful reunification with North Korea to form a new socialist state.\n\nWhy would they have a socialist state when neither Korean state is socialist?  One is a liberal democracy and the other is a totalitarian monarchy.  If any Korean reunification happened, South Korea would almost certainly absorb the North, purely due to the relative size of their economies and populations.\n\nWon't happen any time soon though.  China doesn't want a land border with a US ally, Kim Jong-un doesn't want to lose his power, and South Korea doesn't want to have to deal with the humanitarian crisis North Korea would present if reintegrated.\n\n> These are all truths.\n\nDeclaring your ideological opinion to be truth does not make it so.  Governments, elections, and referendums aren't illegitimate just because you can't imagine that most people in these countries don't share your opinions.\n\n> The US has no right to be the global police.

However, the state is not the be-all-end-all, but instead the global community of peaceful international relations and cooperation. That should be the goal.\n\nOf course it's idiotic to say someone can only be anti-imperialist if they support the total annexation and subjugation of South Korea under North Korea. But what about the opposite? Does South Korea have a divine claim to the whole Korean peninsula? That would be imperialist bullshit. Do they have a claim on the whole peninsula for language, cultural or traditionalist reasons? You might think so, but I disagree! That's nationalism. Fuck that!\n\nI could support peace between North and South Korea, and if I had to choose, I'd say South Korea is probably marginally better, as in more democratic, as a nation than North Korea.\n\nBut the justification is important to me.\n\nIf I supported South Korea, it should be because I believed it would be better for the common people. It should not be because of some claim of land.\n\nThat's for all the conflicts. The goal should be peaceful cooperation. Sometimes that means nations unifying, sometimes that means nations splitting up. But no land ever belongs to any people. That ideology only serves to divide and conquer you. It's only there to sow distrust among fellow humans beings. All nations are projects. The goal is coexistence, not the union of one people, one tribe. Your fellow countrymen and women are not all your friends. If they have the same genes and speak the same language, that doesn't make all of them family. No one has any right to the Earth. It's all made up. We could stand together with the whole world and recognise when rulers and financiers want to set us up against one another.\n\nThat's the explanation why not only do I not believe that Taiwan belongs to China (the people's republic of), I don't even believe the opposite either. Taiwanese people should live in peace either way. The name of your nation is irrelevant. What matters is the quality of life, actual living standards for real.",
