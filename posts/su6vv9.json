Maybe not to everyone, but I don't expect that from a book written around the year 500. The Christians didn't tolerate any other religions than the True Faith, while the Arabic dhimmi are a thing that many who delved into history might know.\n\nThe Islamic faith isn't a bloodless, peaceful faith, but is not worse than any of the others; it is the terrorists that make people scared of a hijab or a burkha, especially in the US where it is rare to meet a muslim.

If you take away the fact that the Taliban have killed so many Pakistanis in various attacks, the vast majority of the country believes rightfully that the Taliban has destroyed Pakistan's reputation to the point of no recovery or at the very least, it would be a long time before the image is repaired. So initially, Malala being a girl who survived a Taliban attack and stood up to condemn them gathered her unanimous support.\n\nInitially....\n\nBut when she became famous, a sizeable amount of the population turned on her because they believe she has become a 'Western puppet'. And the sad thing is that these haters of hers are in every kind of household whether it's lower income household or upper. And their complaints against her are always the same. 'Hurr durr. She talks but doesn't do. Hurr durr'. I personally know a Stanford graduate in his 50s who talks shit about her. And it's sad (pathetic kind of sad, not sad sad). \n\nA lot of it is rooted in mistrust of the West but I would be wrong if i didn't say that sexism plays a part as well. Pakistanis absolutely love [Aitzaz Hasan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aitzaz_Hasan), a brave teenage boy who gave his life by preventing a suicide bomber from entering his school and lost his life for it but some have issues with Malala. And they bring up ludicrous reasons for that.\n\nHer winning the Nobel prize got her a fair few amount of haters because many Pakistanis believe that [Abdul Sattar Edhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul_Sattar_Edhi), a humanitarian who started and ran (before his death) the Edhi Foundation which includes the biggest volunteer ambulance service in the world deserved it more. Again, comes back to sexist undertones. Personally, I believe Mr. Edhi 100% deserved the Nobel Peace Prize as well but that doesn't discount what Malala has done either.\n\nAnd now it's become almost 'edgy and cool' to be a Malala hater because you're not 'towing the narrative line'. And this twitter user is probably one of them.",

I tell them, don't ask me what I did. Ask me what I did not do. I did not clip her wings. And that's all.'\n\nI get goosebumps just remembering that line.

Getting your opinion out there and heard, swaying public opinion, these are worth their fucking weight in gold. Why do you think every fucking politician has a twitter? Why do you think there are so many fucking political adverts? Its not because they are shit and innefective. \n\nYou. Need. Public. Support. The only surefire way for something to happen is, well, money, and if anyone who isn't actively making that happen will never get elected again. This goes a bit skewy for authoritarian regimes and for less democratic institutions, but the point still fucking stands. \nMainly because revolt is always an option. \n\nYeah, cool, the military can come and shove a stick up your ass if you do, but there are always more people than there will be soldiers. You also want to know something? The government can't throw everyone in jail. There gotta be some people working, always.\n\nYou know how you get it so that everyone stops working? And force their institutions to do something? \n\nBy fucking convincing them. Through advertising. Of some form or another.\n\nThese people make me so fucking irationally angry. I just want to sit them down in a room full of people who work in the advertising industry and get them to try and explain the exact details of why and how their profession is useless, only to get fucking laughed out of the room after being shown the exact metrics that show why millions upon millions are shoved into companies producing adverts for our eyeballs. It fucking works.\n\n\nI want to keep ranting but I have nothing else to say.",
