Actually, my family is nordic pagan/wiccan pagan however my daughter hasn\u2019t chosen her persona faith path yet. That\u2019s her decision tho, not mine. My job is to educate her on all paths and support whatever path she chooses for herself. As for the race thing, my daughter is multiracial. We actually work our asses off to make sure that her friend circle is diverse with many cultures. Cuz nobody should have friends that are all the same race or religion. Diversity is what makes America so beautiful. It\u2019s funny you mention CRT, our most recent governor (Youngkin in VA) \u201cended critical race theory being taught in VA\u201d on his first day in office. Which is especially hilarious since that statement was only for campaign purposes as VA has never before used any CRT in their curriculum. The stupid is so contagious. My family actually works super hard to make sure we don\u2019t get stuck with evangelicals in our homeschooling groups. They are MANY homeschoolers like my family now. We are no longer far and few between. Part of the reason I kept my kiddo out of public schools was the ignorance and lack of true history I was ever taught in public schools myself. I vowed that I wouldn\u2019t pass the buck to ignorant people to educate my child then fuss about the lack of education. I will always go above and beyond to give her the education all children truly deserve. This includes life skills. My daughter is age 10 now and about to start 6th grade. She already has marketable skills for the real world that we continue to hone, skills that could even be used to make a living from a work at home situation. Spanish translator and coding/programming. Homeschool families rock now! Please don\u2019t judge us all based on the disgusting extremists that used to be the norm but definitely are not anymore",

I\u2019ve got 16-year-old students who still don\u2019t know what the primary colors are, in spite of having written it down, being quizzed on it, actually using them to mix other colors, and seeing it on a big ass poster in front of their faces every single school day. \n\nEducation will only improve when Americans learn to appreciate it, and make it a priority.",

If they don\u2019t remember it or understand it, it is your job to find another solution to teaching that lesson. You mean they \u201crefuse\u201d when your cookie cutter methods aren\u2019t working. It\u2019s really fucking irritating being told you\u2019re refusing to understand something that the teacher is just shit at explaining. It has zero to do with student\u2019s appreciation, and everything to do with the school system. The underpaid teachers just stop giving a fuck about actually teaching. Students can\u2019t focus on those pathetically small meals either. \n\nStudents not paying attention? Be more engaging. Struggling to hold a concept? Use a different method. A specific student who is always uninterested? Check on them or ask someone else to. \n\n*As a teacher* you have tools in your arsenal to allow for success. But from what I\u2019ve read, you\u2019d rather complain. I\u2019m an artist and I struggled with those damn color wheel quizzes purely because the wording on the one my teacher gave was confusing. It\u2019s not always some weird power struggle.",

It sucks that your art teacher wasn\u2019t great, but in the future maybe you should consider that not everything is specifically about you?",
