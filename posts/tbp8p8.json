They'll look at a dime sized collection of cells, then look at the fully sized human women carrying it, and decide the collection of cells has all the human rights while the actual adult human woman has none.\n\nBecause it was never about the babies, it's always been about denying women body autonomy.

The main drive is a misogynistic desire to punish women for having sex due to a puritanical moral code that doesn't acknowledge it as a natural function and views women as temptresses and \"vessels.\"\n\nThey see sex as both a morally shameful thing for a woman to consent to and ALSO as women's duty within marriage. Those two things combined make women reprehensible by default. You see it all the time in arguments claiming that consent to sex is consent to pregnancy, insisting that women have a \"special duty\" to the fetus that is inescapable because it's their fault it exists in the first place (because again, this is about making sure there are **consequences** for \"fallen\" women), and the push for adoption that refuses to acknowledge that pregnancy itself could have any detrimental effect on a woman. \n\nYou also see the misogyny and shaming in the post-birth views of single mothers on assistance (The \"welfare queen\" narrative, arguments like \"If you can't afford children you shouldn't be having any!\"), the drive to eliminate things like WIC and free school lunches (\"It's your responsibility to take care of your kids, not the government! If you can't afford them, you shouldn't be having kids!\"), the *constant* blaming of mothers for everything that's wrong with their children and either being neglectful or \"helicopter\" parents, and countless others.",

Three days later I was having emergency surgery for the second one.  I could not carry a baby after that - no more tubes.  But some women do carry afterwards IF the ectopic is caught in time.   Which is usually not the case because most of us dont' even realize we are pregnant until just as it's getting to the point of bursting. (it usually burst between six and seven weeks)  I was extremely lucky that I have hyper awareness of my own body and what it is doing on any given day.",

They talk about the things they hate about living here but I've never seen anyone mention any of the things you listed. The few people I've asked have all said they don't care because it doesn't affect them. So I agree completely. \n\nIf they're straight men they don't seem concerned about any current or future partner's ability to get an abortion. Or any daughter. Maybe the pharmacy refuses to sell bc. Btw, is there any provision for bringing the hammer down on deadbeat dads lol jk.\n\nIf they have kids they don't seem concerned about sending their kids to school to learn about how Jesus had a pet dinosaur and Covid is a lie and they won't learn history. \n\nIf they don't have kids they don't seem concerned about living amongst a bunch of stupid people who are stupid parents. \n\nLots of new families move. They don't seem concerned about raising a trans kid. Or a gay or queer kid. \n\nThey're almost certainly white. Why boast about the laws favorable to you if you can't vote for those laws? \n\n>Christian\n\nI'm *so* glad you included this part.",

Women aren't afforded the same right because of an accident of their birth that they didn't agree to or sign up for.  \n\nThe Republican stance on literally all of the arguments you mentioned is not about securing individual rights, but ensuring that whatever conservative happens to be making the argument continues to have the ability to impose his will over other people.  If they actually liked individual freedom, they'd be in favor of LGBTQ+ rights, at the very least, and possibly even affirmative action.",

So no, getting a bus is not an option for people already living paycheck to paycheck. There are much larger problems here.\n\nThese laws don't even prevent abortions. If a woman doesn't want to be pregnant, she will find a way to not be pregnant. All this does is punish poor women for having the audacity to have functioning reproductive systems.

During a physical when I was 16, the doctor told me that if I got pregnant, that it would be terminal and potentially life-threatening. Fast-forward to me at 36, I tried to carry.

They disguise it as women wanting body autonomy being immoral. Thery even wrote an entire book about it and called us SIN, just by virtue of our existence, we are bad and we are sin.\n\nIt's exactly the same reason women aren't allowed to get tubal ligations without having already had babies first, because *our future husbands who don't exist yet might want to use our bodies that way* when men can have vasectomies any time they like.\n\nFor thousands of years women were the slave class. We were taken as bodily property and owned by men to meet their needs. Don't think for one minute the last 50 years of feminism has undone what has been ingrained in humans for millennia.\n\nWomen are not people to the men making these laws, we're chattel. They have no empathy for us as human beings. In the case of ectopic pregnancies, they'd literally prefer both the mother and baby die than let the mother have any choice over saving her own life.

              "text": "Not just civil rights -- *human* rights are at the heart of the issue. Despite what \"pro-life\" people claim (and many believe!), this isn't about children or a question of whether or not a fetus is a child, it's deeper than that. Let me explain:\n\nImagine for a moment that you found out today that you're a perfect kidney match for someone. It was a fluke that this was discovered -- you didn't sign up to be a donor, but a mixup in blood work led yours to being tested. How do you feel? Excited to be able to help? Not wanting to go through a major surgery and recovery and feeling guilty about saying no? Maybe you have a medical condition that could put your life at risk if you go through with donation. Regardless of how you feel, you recognize that it's ultimately your choice about whether to donate your kidney.\n\nNow imagine that you're told you don't have a choice; you're suddenly not allowed to leave the hospital. If you try to leave, you will be charged with murder. Well-meaning volunteers bring you books and food and tell you you're doing the right thing, but you're still being held against your will. You're restrained and forced to go through the surgery to have your organ removed. You need to take a medication for years as your body adapts to a single kidney, and it's going to cost over $200,000. It's not covered by insurance because, despite being forced to have the surgery, insurance considers it an elective, non-necessary procedure.The recovery time from the surgery and organ removal lasts months. Maybe you're lucky enough to have a job where you can work remotely, but maybe not. Maybe your inability to physically do the labor means you're now unemployed. Sorry about that. You probably should have considered it before you signed up to be an organ donor. What, you didn't sign up? Well, you should have known this sort of accident was a possibility.\n\nThis would be patently unfair. You would feel outraged and trapped and helpless whether it was happening to you or even just knowing it was happening to someone else.\n\nNow, a kidney isn't a baby, but neither is a fetus. To be frank, it wouldn't matter if it was a baby. Nobody has the right to use someone else's body without their permission, even if it would save their life. That's why we can't just force people to give blood when the blood banks are low. Hell, it's why we can't take organs from a dead person unless they agreed to be an organ donor while alive. Bodily autonomy is a basic human right. You determine what happens with your body. That's also why it's a crime to desecrate a corpse. We hold that people have an involitable right to their bodily integrity. By forcing women to use their bodies to support another's, we violate that right. It also places a woman in a position where she is a second-class citizen: her bodily autonomy (again, a recognized human right) is conditional, whereas a man's never is.\n\nSo legally, you cannot justify forcing a woman to carry a pregnancy against her will. Again, you can try to convince her she should -- you could offer financial and moral support, provide religious justification, etc., but you can never legally prevent it because you can't force people to use their bodies to keep other people alive.",

Furthermore, it CERTAINLY doesn't mean that a government entity has the right to force someone to donate their organs for the continuation of the pregnancy. Even if you consider a fetus a fully autonomous human, that doesn't give it the right to use another's organs without the other person's consent.",

The fact that they treat it differently when it's abortion shows they either don't think it's murder or don't think it's human.\n\nLikewise when they carve out exceptions for incest or rape. Is there any law out there in the world where you are allowed to murder an innocent third party, a child at that, because someone else made you the victim of a crime? Of fucking course not. \n\nThose exceptions exist because if you are raped they think it's not your fault. And therein lies the game.

The only reason this would extend to including the death penalty is that the death penalty can be awarded in Texas for the murder of someone under the age of 6.",

You are saying that that woman is worth less than you and you have a right to tell her what she can do with her body. Unless an alternative housing is offered to house the clump of cells to grow into a baby it is wrong to take away an option to them. All you are doing is saying that you believe woman are inferior to you and men, why is the man not getting death sentence for rape that caused the pregnancy.  Why are you not forcing men on death row for rape of kids, why are u not calling for blood for the 10 year old that froze to death due to the states neglect and greed. That's the real discussion, why are woman being pushed and not the men. It takes 2 to make a baby, equal rights and punishments.",

A person who murders a pregnant woman is often charged with two murders. Some states inexplicably can demand child support from a father while the child is in the womb, despite how hard and cost prohibitive it is to prove he is the father.

I was like 12 and just asked her about abortions because I heard about it on TV. I believe that people who call themselves pro life geniuenly see a fetus as sentient and therefore in need of protection",

Believing about half of the populace hate women and want them to suffer is no way to go through life. There's absolutely no question that a large number of pro-lifers truly feel this is a human rights issue and that abortion is murder. \n\nI used to view it as a human rights issue and was anti-abortion. In fact, I still do view it as an interesting human rights theoretical question, but I also believe that the right to choose is the far lesser of two evils.",

Atleast allowing it up till 12 weeks for rape cases and 8 weeks for normal ones. I'm from India and even we allow abortions up to 12 weeks normally and even immediate abortions for rape victims mandated by court under any circumstance. We did have the opposite a decade and a half ago where gender based abortions existed but when the gender ratio declined. Everyone realized it was stupid to do that. Even today, pre determination of the gender before birth is illegal here. I think one thing can solve all problems for you guys. Remove jury from courts. We did it in the 1950s and its been peaceful and unbiased in that sense. Jury's always have bias. It's better to follow a set instruction rather than go on emotions. Would also solve the racism issue completely.",

Sorry to hear about your mom. Lost mine a few years ago so I understand the feeling. Also incase of genetic issues, you can always freeze your eggs. Become sterile and use a surrogate. This approach surprisingly works for a lot of women with genetic traits that they don't want passed on. This is just a suggestion incase you wish to have kids in the future but want some basic immunity for the offspring and I'm not saying this just for USA. You might need it just to have healthy children in general, freezing helps secure the healthiest eggs further decreasing the risk. Still best of luck. Hope that American lawmakers get some basic common sense. I don't even understand what they gain by banning abortions. Specially if it's the result of an assault.",

They\u2019re still important criticisms, but for the sake of argument I\u2019ll simplify.)\n\nWe have a lot of data on what functionally prevents abortions and pro-lifers almost never support these. This could be comprehensive sex Ed, access to birth control, increased privacy rights, increased maternal support at critical points, strong domestic violence laws, etc. There is a pervasive idea that pro-choice people *want* abortions when pretty much everyone across the board wants to reduce them. If there\u2019s a misunderstanding of intent, it\u2019s really tiresome having proven policy tools you can\u2019t use because of inconsistent *reasons*. You mentioned that this is \u201ckilling\u201d for others\u2019 rights but we have loads of examples of just that. Stand your ground is a prime example. I\u2019ve also never seen these folks harassing and calling in bomb threats to IVF facilities, despite the amount of fetal material they throw out. There\u2019s also an autonomy argument here I\u2019ll also set aside for simplicity but long story short, no where else is it normal to force people to sacrifice use of their organs against their will.\n\nI\u2019ve actually had this conversation in earnest with pro lifers and this refusal to adopt policies that actually work and selective outrage is typically why people feel this way. Even posing the question \u201cif you had to choose between a handful of \u2018lib\u2019 policies proven to reduce abortion and banning abortion even if it doesn\u2019t change the number of abortions but push it underground,\u201d 100% or the time IME, they choose the latter.",

      "text": "I am struggling with this in a major way. For myself, I wouldn't get an abortion but that is my choice for my body. I do not believe anyone in the 1% of all abortions who got pregnant through rape, emotional/physical entrapment, incest, or pregnancy resulting in dangerous medical issues should ever get flack for seeking out an abortion, let alone getting one. \n\nMy heart is torn on the 99% of America that are after thought birth control. Birth control isn't free and readily available in any form for women. It should be. There is no birth control for men beyond condoms and vasectomies which is ridiculous. Birth control messes up some women so badly that isn't it an option. As much as I hate the thought of abortion I am not stepping up to care for all those babies so my opinion should rightfully have very limited to no impact on such a large personal decision. My heart goes out to men who wanted their babies only to have the woman get an abortion. Those men don't have a voice before or after. Then again, men can impregnate numbers of women, walkaway, and never have to worry about if or how those kids will be fed their next meal. Women get left to raise kids on their own all the time often living in poverty. There are a lot of single Dad's out there doing the same and again they often have no voice or acknowledgement. This is such a multifaceted situation and it requires a varied approach to help as many people involved as possible (fetuses included). This capital punishment approach to punishing women who seek abortions while there is no free and really available birth control for BOTH genders, better social programs, better adoption policies blows my mind. Stop forcing your personal beliefs onto other people when you have no plans of lifting a finger to help them. I don't think sharing ones beliefs is wrong but if your view isn't accepted by someone else it doesn't mean you are right or the better person. It just means you agree to disagree. Why can't people do that anymore? Women's medical issues should be between the patient, their doctor, and anyone the patient allows into their business. The government shouldn't have a say, just guidelines to ensure safety.",

Before that it is a part of the mother's body, since it can't survive on its own. How your limit for abortions arrives at 8-10 weeks is beyond me frankly, just like your claim that abortions are performed in inhumane ways.",

Nope.\n\nBut unfortunately you can't tell them that without them arguing proving it right.",

Partial birth abortions are performed in extremely rare cases in which there is a major health problem with the mother or fetus.  Usually both.  In *those specific cases* either the fetus could not survive being born (or was already dead), or the mother wouldn\u2019t survive it being born(or again, most commonly both).  Just because otherwise healthy babies occasionally survive that early in a pregnancy does not mean that all fetuses are healthy and would survive being born, even much later.  So they aren\u2019t viable for those specific extremely rare cases in which a partial birth abortion is deemed necessary.\n\nAgain though, it is *already illegal* to perform a partial birth abortion unless the fetus is dead or a doctor determines woman wouldn\u2019t survive normal birth, and a partial birth abortion is the only way to save her.  Those are the *only* times a partial birth abortion is ever performed in the US.  So which of those two scenarios do you want to ban?  Because all other cases are already banned.",

There are ways we can tell if the neurological processes related to consciousness are present.

Changing the definition to suit your argument automatically defeats your argument. \n\nNow, if you're attempting to make a MORAL argument then you need to realize that there is no such thing as an objective universal morality. Morality is a product of the society in which it is found. And your expressed version is in the minority (and not changing in your favor) in the majority of western society in which I assume you reside. What you are trying to do is supplant the predominant morality with your own. \n\nSo let's call things what they are. Abortion is not murder at present in most of western society! If your morality is different than that which you find in the society within which you find yourself you could simply find a society that meets your approval. There are still some that have not yet moved beyond your personal morality. Or, you know, you could just not get an abortion and stay where you are and leave everyone else alone.",

Or maybe the child has a genetic problem that would be a huge financial burden and would lead to a low quality if life for said child. Or maybe the mother was raped. Are there some abortions that truly were \"just because?\" I'll give you that, sure maybe. But there's 2 way to look at it. 1) misuse by a small few means take it away for all, or 2) accept that protecting the rights of those who deserve them sometimes mean protecting them for those very few who maybe don't. For the side that claims to stand for freedom, they sure love taking away people's freedom.\n\nPlenty of people who will adopt. Sure, that is why the US adoption system is overloaded with children that nobody wants to adopt. Oops.\n\nPeople shouldn't have sex if they don't want kids? What are you 12? Personally, I don't like abortions, but instead of taking away people's rights, I think there should be a push for safe sex education for everyone (teens, adults, seniors) and easy access to contraception, and getting rid of abstinence only education that has been proven to not work.",

Nobody _wants_ to have an abortion, it is something women do when they _really, really need to_. Taking away this option from women is just really dangerous for womankind as a whole. And it's quite naive to say \"people shouldn't have sex if they don't want kids\" because this is not how the human brain works. We are generally very sexual animals. Also, rape unfortunately exists.

Would the injured but conscious passenger be justified to say \u201cdon\u2019s save them, it would cause me trauma\u201d?",
