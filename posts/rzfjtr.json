Of course there was a lot of mixing with the black Nilo-Saharan Nubians, but much of the population likely came from a mix of Afro-Asiastic proto-Berbers, which are not black, and other related peoples from the Sinai or somewhere close in the Middle East.",

As indicated in the study, the 151 mummies (not 90) used for sampling are taken from three periods, Pre-Ptolemaic (New Kingdom, Third Intermediate Period and Late Period), Ptolemaic and Roman Period, which means that they cover around 1300 years of Ancient Egyptian history. What this study shows is as follows:\n\n1/ Genomes for the three groups are similar, which indicates that between Pre-Ptolemaic and Roman Periods the genomic structure of the mummified individuals didn't change a lot despite the passing of 1300 years and frequent invasions (which also rules out your suggestion that these people would be Greek or Roman foreigners);\n\n2/ There is also a level of continuity between the haplogroups of these individuals and modern-day Egyptians', who however show a marked increase of sub-Saharan African influx. In fact, the haplogroups of ancient Egyptians are closer to those of modern-day Levant/Near East populations, which would indicate that modern-day Lebanese or Syrians look more like ancient Egyptians than modern-day Egyptians themselves.\n\n\"We find that all three ancient Egyptian groups cluster together (Fig. 3b), supporting genetic continuity across our 1,300-year transect. Both analyses reveal higher affinities with modern populations from the Near East and the Levant compared to modern Egyptians (Fig. 3b,c).\"\n\n3/ There is no continuity between the haplogroups of the sampled individuals and modern-day Ethiopians;\n\n\"Genetic continuity between ancient and modern Egyptians cannot be ruled out by our formal test despite this sub-Saharan African influx, while continuity with modern Ethiopians17, who carry >60% African L lineages, is not supported (Supplementary Data 5).\"",

What this study shows is as follows:\n\noh no it was 90.\n\n>\"We extracted DNA from 151 mummified human remains and prepared double-stranded Illumina libraries with dual barcodes22,23. Then we used DNA capture techniques for human mitochondrial DNA24\u00a0and for 1.24 million genomic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)25\u00a0in combination with Illumina sequencing, **through which we successfully obtained complete human mitochondrial genomes from 90 samples and genome-wide SNP data from three male individuals passing quality control.**\"\n\nActually 90 complete mitochondrial samples and only 3 with SNP data passing quality control. So they might be basing it of just those 3. \n\nThis is corroborated in the abstract where it reads:\n\n>>\"Here we present 90 mitochondrial genomes as well as genome-wide data sets from three individuals obtained from Egyptian mummies. The samples recovered from Middle Egypt span around 1,300 years of ancient Egyptian history from the New Kingdom to the Roman Period.\u00a0\"\n\nSo they used 90 not 151, but either way this is a small sample sized, and from that time period the encompassed foreign incursions into the region as the above citation reads. \n\nTo address your last points, I'll just say this. It's very clear that this article was written by racists, who are trying to convince the world by assertions alone that sun saharan african DNA is what disconnects the ppl in modern Egypt from ancient Egypt. If this is true then why not publish the raw data from each the pre Ptolemaic, the Ptolemaic and the Roman Period and show us that no Sub-Saharan african DNA existed in any of those. They won't do that. Instead they mix a 3 periods together, knowing that the majority of the samples were from post foreign invasion periods. And then cherry pick 90 of the 151, all from the time period where foreign incursions came into Egypt(and also cherry picked 3 for SNP analysis from the same period). And they use this info to lie and claim sub saharan is what disconnects them from ancient Egypt, while admitting the non African DNA is foreign. They even went so far as to use this cherry picked data to claim that Africans had no connections to an African civilization but modern Europeans did. It's hilarious really. Not surprising coming from 3 German scientists.",

I'll just leave the racism accusation aside as this is pure nonsense. \n\nNot really, scientific racism is a real thing that goes back to at least the 19th century when they used pseudoscientific philosophies to justify slavery, not just some \"conspiracy theory\".  Scientific racism is at the foundation of many of these modern theories on black people. An article being \"peer reviewed\" doesn't negate biases from the conducting scientists and/or the \"peer group\". \n\n>On the other side, claiming that this study is incorrect because it was conducted by a Germany-based team of 16 -(not 3) scientists is indeed racism on your side. \n\nNow see this is a STRAW MAN, because that's not why I said it was incorrect. I pointed out them being from Germany as an interesting coincidence for them maintaining that the cherry picked data they used allegedly proved that modern Africans had no connections to ancient Egypt by modern Europeans did. That's the only thing I said about Germany. And the fact they used obviously carefully cherry picked data to come to that assertion is proof of their racism.\n\n>I don't know where you got the idea that the 90 mitochondrial genomes are from the same time period: this is simply not the case and shows that you still didn't read the study.

There's an excel attached to this study with the datation for each one of the 90 mitochondrial genomes, I suppose you should have a look.\n\nIt's funny that you accused me of \"not reading the article\" yet you sit here and still question whether the 90 mitochondrial genomes came from the post foreign invasion. I won't accuse you of not reading the article, but that certainly displays that you have no comprehension of what you read. I cited all the places that mentions that they only used the 90 mitochondrial genomes (as well as only 3 for SNP analysis) and that they all came from the post foreign invasion periods. It says it clear as day in multiple places that I already quoted for you, [so just go reread those quotes from my past comments.](https://www.reddit.com/r/confidentlyincorrect/comments/rzfjtr/comment/hs00po8/)\n\n>Earliest mummy is from circa 1388 to 1311 BC, more than 1000 years before Alexander's invasion of Egypt. There's an excel attached to this study with the datation for each one of the 90 mitochondrial genomes, I suppose you should have a look.\n\nOk and? Ancient Egypt began AT LEAST around 3100BC, so that's ALOT of unaccounted for years to make a claim like the one the espoused. You realize you are PROVING exactly what I said about them having no samples from PREDYNASTIC EGYPT. 1388BC is not only during dynastic period, it is also post foreign incursions to the region (like I've been saying all along). You clearly are further proving that you have no comprehension of what you're reading and that you also have no grasp of historical timelines in Ancient Egypt. Whether it's before Alexander the Great or not is IRRELEVANT cuz foreign incursions happened before the time of him.\n\n>Results for the 3 periods are also not mixed together, and we get the mitochondrial genomes for each of them.\n\nNo we don't 1388BC isn't predynastic. It's even after the time of the Hyksos invasion, which was 1 of many other foreign incursions that happened prior to the Greek. So even them saying Pre-Ptolemaic is misleading cuz foreign incursions happened even in the Pre-Ptolemaic time period that the study highlighted.\n\n>Finally, claiming that is a small sample is pure BS, as this study is basically unprecedented in its size.\n\nNo what you're saying is BS. Whether 151 or 90, these samples are from mummified remains, and only the ruling elites did mummification NOT the general population. We already know foreigners came and married into the elite and ruled by proxy. This is documented. It doesn't mean their were mass amalgamation in the general population at that time. And furthermore it is disingenuous to compare the samples from post foreign incursions to the general population of modern times, cuz as I pointed out you're comparing the ruling elite of that time period to the general population of now.",

So much so, any random person of African descent can be more genetically similar to any random person of any other descent other than another African. \n\nThe best way to explain it is if there\u2019s a jar of m&ms and you grab a handful and place it into another jar and then from that new jar you grab a handful of m&ms from that and place it into another and repeat. You\u2019ll find that by the time you place it into 10, 50, 100 jars that any jar after the derivative will have a lower diversity of colours than the original. But if you grab one single m&m from any jar you\u2019re more likely to find a match in the original than any of the other derivative jars due to the lower diversity of colors found in the other jars. \n\nNow imagine if other human species have pretty much the same m&ms variation as humans just that in every 1000 m&ms there\u2019s 3 m&ms with a slightly different color variation like a pastel blue m&m or beige m&m. Even if you were to grab a handful of Neanderthal DNA and throw into one of the random jars with modern human DNA there\u2019s almost no chance that that DNA would be enough to make that population distinct from other human populations with no Neanderthal DNA.  Because Neanderthals, like modern humans also originated from Africa. They just left a little earlier than us and that\u2019s why they ended up with a few different genetic differences from us. \n\nAnd like m&ms , it should be worth noting that any human \u201crace\u201d (ethnicities) as we colloquially define it mostly has superficial differences. Individual dog and cat breeds are more genetically different from each other than the various human \u201craces\u201d. \n\nI hope that helps!",

I can provide further scholarly scientific references if you like, though they are quite easy to find online. \n\nBut the main points I wanted to make are:\n\n(a) Genetic diversity is not related just to obvious visual characteristics like skin colour, height etc. It can include a lot of things that you would never see, like quality of eyesight, resistance to certain diseases, amount of sweat produced by certain parts of the body etc. Just because people might look similar to you does not mean they are genetically very similar.\n\n(b) Having said that, just because two people look similar to *you* doesn't mean they look similar to everyone. E.g. I'm a white guy and I can generally tell if someone is of Mediterranean descent vs Nordic vs Russian etc. But I'll bet you they all look the same to someone who's grown up in Nairobi or whatever. On the other hand, I bet you that guy could tell us whether someone comes from Kenya or Zimbabwe or whatever just by looking at them, whereas those people might look to me like they are ethnically identical.",

There is actually nothing wrong with it, contrary to what you have been told and taught.  That is what is so disgusting about this thread.  \n\nThe majority of images of Buddha depicted a black person until fairly recently.  However, your utter contempt for black and African descended people was heard loud and clear.  It's just not possible, light skin is good and dark is bad.  Totally disgusting.  Would you need therapy if it was the truth? Is it that hard to believe?  Given all the lies that religions and spiritual traditions advance, why would it be so hard to fathom that Buddhism has obscured it's origins as well? Why do modern statues of Buddha depict a different phenotype from antiquity?  Most people, except colonized Africans, will not worship someone who is not a reflection of themselves.  So hence, there was migration and intermarriage in all of these regions. And over time, the image of Buddha changed.  Same thing with the Greeks, and the Catholic Madonna image is a bastardization of Isis and Horus.  What I take away from this, is that Africans have no right to study history and point out all the civilizations that migrated out of African, because people really want argue viciously in a Reddit to protect their notions of whiteness.  That's the insanity.  It should not matter, but obviously it does.",

He was rather slim actually, starting off as a local prince of an Indian state, and then he became bored and disillusioned, and started walking around, seeing suffering everywhere while not having been accustomed to it having been sheltered in his upbringing. He tried starving himself as an ascetic monk apart from others, but   didn\u00b4t find enlightenment as he wanted, and so stopped doing that. He started doing things in a middle path and ate normally, but not excessively, and gained a proper weight. \n\nThe goal of Buddhism is to free yourself from earthly desires that cause people to have unrealistic expectations, jealousies, and things we want to hold onto after we die that makes us afraid of others, afraid of death, afraid of loss, and so starvation or extreme obesity would not create that inner peace nor free us from our desires.",

Arguably Europe as a whole could really be seen as much a subcontinent of Eurasia as India is.\n\nNorthern Indians can be pretty light skinned; race is a non-scientific classification but there is a closer ethnolinguistic connection between Europe and North India than there is between North India and East Asia, even arguably between North and South India, English is the same language family as Hindi (Indo European) but different from Southern Indian languages like Tamil which are Dravadian, a totally different language family. There are genetic commonalities between Europeans and Indians, particularly North Indians, as well. Lighter skin in India is generally associated with higher caste, and Buddha was a prince of the kshatriya/warrior caste.\n\nBuddha traditionally supposedly had some physical characteristics, such as blue eyes, that are characteristically Caucasian, although these are likely idealistic and symbolic rather than realistic or historical. Like Jesus, there are no physical representations of him in early Buddhism, the first images date to centuries after his death, and were made according to the religious needs of the community at the time, they were not a realistic representation. I'm not trying to claim that he was \"white\", applying modern American racial ideas to the founder of an Indian religion 2,500 years ago would be totally anachronistic and I'm not sure it really matters either. But Northern Indian aristocracy could well have been about as white passing as Jesus was. The great Indian emperor Ashoka, who adopted and spread Buddhism throughout India, was himself part Greek, and Greek was one of the languages his edicts were issued in.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1o854j/what_race_was_siddhartha_gautama/\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_characteristics_of_the_Buddha\n\n>Indians share a gene with Europeans that plays a significant role in coding for lighter skin, new research suggests.\n\n>The study, published Thursday in the journal PLOS Genetics, also revealed that the gene, which is responsible for 27 percent of skin color variation in Indians, was positively selected for in North, but not South Indian populations.\n\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/sciencemain/indians-europeans-share-light-skin-genetic-coding-8c11566211",

Some evidence speaks for an origin on the other side of the Black sea, in Northern Turkey or more tenuously a bit further east of Ukraine, perhaps near Afghanistan. Any way you look at it, though, these languages did not originate in the Caucuses, nor did the people who spoke them. \n\n(c) There is a group of Caucasian languages, including languages like ~~Georgian and~~ Chechen. They have no known connection to Indo-European. Speaking anecdotally, I find them to be completely alien in structure and impossible to wrap my mind around.\n\n(d) Language does not necessarily equal genetics. While we can confidently say that at some point someone brought the Indo-European languages to India, we can't say to what extent those people actually invaded, or replaced the natives. It might have been a small ruling class that brought the language there without replacing most of the population (like French in medieval England). In that case, the Indian people in general may not have a very close genetic connection to any European peoples.

Ancient people thought it was a type of fish, but with the advantage of modern science we can see it is more closely related to ancient mammals. Further, we can know that those same ancestors gave rise to pigs and hippos. So we put them in the same group, namely Artiodactyla (forgive me if that's not quite right, I'm not a biologist).\n\nIn the same way, linguists don't look at where a language is spoken today for its classification. Rather, they look at its ancestry. So Ossetian is, for linguists, an Indo European language regardless of where it is spoken today.",

I've always understood that both these languages were descendants of Sanskrit, which has been in that area for at least 2,500 years (assuming our dating of the Sutras is not completely off base). \n\nDoesn't this suggest that whoever brought Urdu and its predecessor languages into the area had plenty of time to reproduce and replace the natives?",

This language was created because of the policy of the \"Persianisation\" of the sub continent lead by firstly the Delhi sultanate and then by the Mughal Empire. Urdu was basically the language of the court and the literary language with Farsi during the Mughal empire, it wasn't yet a thing under the Delhi Sultanate(so since the 16th).\nAnd here we have the tied about Urdu, because it was the lingua Franca of the muslim elite it was chosen as an official language by Pakistan, and was much more rejected by India",

All the reading I've done on the topic states that Urdu developed alongside Hindi, from a common ancestor. It didn't just arise during the 13th century (obviously, as no language just arises out of nowhere).\n\nRather, what happened at that time was that Urdu and Hindi started to be differentiated. Urdu started using Farsi (Persian) words for official stuff, because the ruling class was Persian. This is similar to the way English started using French words for official stuff in the 11th century because the ruling class was French.\n\nBut, just like English, the core language didn't change that much and the people being ruled continued speaking the same language they had since time immemorial. That's why Urdu and Hindi are largely mutually intelligible (for non official stuff) but Urdu and Farsi are not. If there had been a large scale replacement of the local language to that of the Persian elite in the 13th century, you'd expect a high level of mutual intelligibility between Urdu and Farsi speakers, which is not found.\n\nAll the evidence I have seen points to Urdu being in a group of languages that have been spoken in South Asia (and not in Iran) for at least 2,500 years. This is somewhat disguised by the use of the Persian (modified Arabic) writing system, which indeed was adopted under Persian rule. But that doesn't change the fundamentally South Asian origin of the language. \n\nSo I don't think the widespread use of Urdu is evidence of language adoption. If anything, it's evidence of the persistence of native language in the face of significant cultural change.",

Routledge at p. 163.\n\nTo clarify, each of these sources does not merely side with the Kurgan hypothesis - it says that this is the generally accepted hypothesis amongst scholars. I have discharged the burden of showing that there is, prima facie, agreement on this topic and what that agreement is.\n\nFind me a credible, published source that says there *isn't* general consensus on this topic and give me a specific reference, just as I have done above.

They got most of it. There is no heaven or hell. Occult or esoteric Judaism is the practice of the 1st princple. After than is just corrupt rewrites. \n\n\nNo one talks about Jesus or Issa. In his 20s he rode along the silk road and he went back to learning old Hermetics. Thats why he was critical of the jews. He didn't believe in the false teachings. \n\nHe also said there is no heaven and hell. Not once. They few times he mentions heaven its misinterpreted. Here is the quote. \n\n\n>In\u00a0Luke 17:20\u201321, Jesus says, \u201cThe kingdom of God does not come with observation; nor will they say, \u2018See here!\u2019 or \u2018See there!\u2019 For indeed, the kingdom of God is within you\u201d (NKJV).\n\n>Jesus was once asked when the kingdom of God would come. The kingdom of God, Jesus replied, is not something people will be able to see and point to. Then came these striking words: \u201cNeither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.\u201d (Luke 17:21) With these words, Jesus gave voice to a teaching that is universal and timeless. (Older than NKJ)\n\nThats the first rule if Hermetics. You make heaven ot hell within you. Perception is reality.\n\n\nLastly we come to Wahdat-al-wujud. He basically is the core philosopher behind sufi Islam. https://youtu.be/F_MIw4KG7Qk\n\n\nAlso when Moses came down from Mount Sinai he said *Your gods aren't real*\n\nSo that 3 for 3 on being misinterpreted while being directly linked to the first principle of Hermetics.\n\nMasons are Hermetics. They always get confused with being Christian.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/cOuGlHx.jpg\n\nIts right on the website. Literally.\n\nI'm not making this stuff up. I'm just the only one who isn't concerned with 3,000 years of established false religions that misinterpreted the Orginal 7 principles and causes massive death throughout history.\n\nNeat fact even Judaism  admits the star of david isn't of Jewish creation.\n\nhttps://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/aboutisrael/israelat50/pages/the%20flag%20and%20the%20emblem.aspx#:~:text=The%20Star%20of%20David%20became%20the%20emblem%20of%20Zionist%20Jews,but%20Jewry%20as%20a%20whole.",

I mention things as Hermetics but anything other than the 7 princples is also a gross misinterpretation of the 7 Hermetic principles. \n\nThis is proto Hermetics.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maat\n\n\nThis is what followed next\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/BSQGDh1.jpg\n\nCouple thousand years went by\n\nThen Abraham left egypt.\n\nhttps://www.theologyofwork.org/old-testament/genesis-12-50-and-work/abraham-genesis-121-2511/abrahams-journey-begins-with-disaster-in-egypt-genesis-128-132\n\n\n\nThen it got mutilated from then on. The kybalion is a misinterpretation. Judaism is a misinterpretation. Christianity is a misinterpretation. Islam is a misinterpretation. I will give credit to the Kybalion which explains the 7 princples a little. \n\nThe 7 princples date back to pre dynastic Egypt.\n 2500 years before the greeks stole it.\n\nBefore if was turned into a way to control people.\n\nThe closest way to practice those 7 princples is by seeing the 7 princples in other philosophies.\n\nSo the idea your Mind is your god and through it you can change your perception of reality, or the kingdom of heaven is within you, \n\n\nIs verrry similar to Braham. Clear your mind, be flexible. Don't grow attached to things, free your energy and you can reach nirvana. A state of happiness. \n\nIts all linked. Find philosophy that correspond with those pincples and you can find a good way to practice it. If you can do it without inspiration from other philosophies thats also awesome.\n\n\nEdits:\n\n(The gender princple is the hardest for people to understand. Everyone has masculinity and femininity in them. Masculinity, the square is action and femininity, the  triangle is creativity, the cicle is balance. thats why Christianity thinks there are only 2 genders. There are individual consciousness who have different ratios of masculinity and femininity https://i.imgur.com/4loMrqi.jpg)\n\n(Also Issac Newton was the last person to rewrite the 7 princples https://youtu.be/6xvB81s4xMU this Jewish rabbi does a good job at explaining it.)\n\nThis is a very deep subject. I mean its thousands of years old lol. I hope I am making sense while talking about this.",

You can say \"people of the Indian or Asian Subcontinent\" but you absolutely cannot describe all of them as \"Indians.\"\n\nNot only did India not exist as a country during Buddha's time, but Nepal as a country is much older than India, so this is another point that does not make much sense.",

Southern Indians are darker skinned and have different diets. Northern Indians are more white skinned and have a high vegetarian lifestyle. Eastern Indians are also very different from both. The Republic of India has more than 200 different languages,have people of different religions, and is extremely culturally diverse in itself. India has been used as the term of the subcontinent and the people in it. Winston Churchill even quotes that \u201cIndia is a geographical term. It is no more a united nation than the Equator.\u201d And it\u2019s culturally ignorant of you comparing China and India together they are completely different. India has been ruled by empires older than Nepal and Buddha. As an Indian myself I think I know way better about this topic. \n\nEdit: South East Asia, Korea, and Japan are in what\u2019s known as the Sinosphere (Chinese cultural influence).

The united kingdom lost a third of its land in the treaty. There was a british representative stationed in nepal after the treaty but it was more akin to a modern ambassador.

          "text": "Some things: \n\n- \"Buddha\" is a title, not a name. \n\n- The original Buddha was a prince named Siddhartha Gautama. \n\n- Statues depict that hairstyle because Gautama was said to have curly hair\n\n- IIRC, the fat Buddha is a forthcoming Buddha from Mahayana Buddhist mythology\n\n(edit: I know a lot less about Mahayana Buddhism, but apparently some believe that Budai/Hotei is destined to be reborn as a Buddha? Thus regard him as a forthcoming Buddha?)\n\n- The Buddha Gautama's skin color and features probably resemble those native to Northern India, so he may well have been dark\n\nAlso edit: I know people from northern India arent as dark as the original post implies, but def not \"white Asian,\" whatever that means. The Buddha is often white in statues, but like pure snow white, which is traditional and symbolic, not literal.\n\nSource: not from Asia, but I spent six years as a journalist in Thailand and Myanmar, both staunchly Therevada Buddhist countries.\n\n**More fun Theravada Buddhist facts!**\n\n(Theravada is the older and more traditional form of Buddhism, roughly analogous to the Catholic Church and widely practiced in SE Asia. Mahayana Buddhism is the form commonly practiced in China.)\n\n- the Buddha died from food poisoning after eating spoiled pork.\n\n\n- In one early sermon, rings of light were said to have shone around the Buddha's head, thus a ton of statues have blinking LED light rings behind him, which is sort of cool.\n\n\n- Nirvana is when your soul is not reincarnated at all. It translates to \"a candle blowing out.\" The Buddha taught that the wheel of reincarnation was a tortuous grind. We keep getting reborn because our greed, envy, joy, love and other emotions bind us to the wheel. Thus, you have to free yourself from desire itself; the only way to win the game is to not play.\n\n\n- of all the heavens, hells, and other realms, Earth is the closest to Nirvana because it is has an even balance of pleasure and pain. \n\n\n- to achieve Nirvana, you have to be reborn on Earth, then eventually you have to be born as a human, then a human MAN, then a MONK, and then MAYBE, after a few hundred lifetimes, you might have a shot at Nirvana. \n\n\n- Karma is a real thing, but it doesnt play out within a single lifetime. You wont save a cat and then a year later find $100 as a reward. Karma affects how your NEXT life will play out. Also, it's a natural law of the universe, not a system of rewards and punishments. Good and bad deeds alter your state of mind, which will nudge you towards one type of rebirth or other.\n\n\n- If you die thinking about food, you might come back as a hungry ghost. Hungry ghosts are fucked. They float around the earth without being able to interact with it, thus it's extremely hard for them to gain good karma. They have to overhear sermons from monks, or they have to watch someone make an offering on their behalf (since, again, karma is a state of mind, not an external system of rewards and punishments). So people make offerings and prayers specifically for any hungry ghosts that might be around, thus gaining merit for the both of them.\n\n\n- the Buddha thought men were closer to Nirvana because women were too emotional and volatile. He didn't want to create a monastic order for women, but his mother pushed for it. To this day, the Sangha (the body of Buddhist clergy) debates whether or not nuns are truly sacred\n\n\n- In some places, most famously Myanmar, most people will do at least a few short stints in a monastery as a monk or nun. It's like Buddhist church camp. Occasionally my coworkers (men and women) would take a few weeks off and then come back to the office with shaved heads.",

They had round silver coins with the portraits of their rulers, their armies were hoplites, and they made bronze and marble statues of their gods in the Greek style.\n\nAnd one one of the gods they made statues of was Buddha Gautama, because Buddhism was being heavily proselytized at the time by the Indian kingdoms  (to the point that there were actually Buddhist preacher in the Alexandria in Egypt), and the Bactrians picked it up.\n\nBefore that point, there was actually a long aniconic tradition of Buddha in India, involving an emptry throne to represent him. After that point, Buddha statues started to spread, copying the way he was depicted by the Bactrians.\n\nAnd because, again, the Bactrians were Hellenized, they made Buddha statues with the curly hair that was typical to Greece and their statues. But the Indians didn't interpret those curls as just curls, but as a specific hairstyle, and over time and distance it morphed into the characteristic \"snails on head\" that we see today.",

Buddha specifically said they are equally capable of reaching enlightenment as men.\n\nBuddha's hesitance in establishing the nun's order was not because women were \"emotional and volatile\", but because of the prevailing social constraints in India at the time. Buddha was revolutionary in that era in admitting women's equal ability in spiritual advancement as men.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>To this day, the Sangha (the body of Buddhist clergy) debates whether or not nuns are truly sacred\n\nNuns are  part of the Sangha community as much as monks.

Most of them wanting to go to the West Pure Land of Amit\u0101bha. But in the original beginning of the sect, they actually wanting to go to met Maitreya instead.\n\nAlso, are you a fellow monk?

              "text": "I will add a few more!\n\nAccording to the tales, females was not accepted into monks as the OG Buddha, the Buddha that kick started Buddhism in mortal realms, Shakyamuni Buddha. Said it will make the \"dark times of Buddhism\" comes earlier in mortal realms. But later it was waved as the Buddha himself was soft hearted and wish to give all a chance to Nirvana.\n\nKarma system is also works in both ways. There's no good verses evil deeds. Some evil deeds are still need to be payed, whether or not you had done many good deeds. You can either repay the deed with the same thing you did to other happening to you again, or obtain good karma in the name of the victim(explaining this in full detail with English is REALLY LONG).\n\nThe spoiled pork story is ONE of the story that on how Shakyamuni Buddha pass away. The story was The Buddha himself knew that the pork was spoiled, but he didn't want to waste food(bad karma), and ruining the karma of the person(believe it was a student of the Buddha). He ate it despite knowing the food is spoiled. \n\nAlso, the Nirvana can be reached by a human by either male or female. The key was the how much you had let go, and how much your good karma had collected. A person with a lot of great karma but still hold on to humanly desires can be reborn as deity, but that's still not in Nirvana. Also, there are \"females\" Buddha. Them are the ones who creates \u6cd5\uff0cknown as the gateways to Nirvana. They says there are 84000 gateways(\u4f5b\u6cd5\u6709\u516b\u4e07\u56db\u5343\u6cd5\u95e8), but all of them are equally hard. \n\nThere are a lot of different Buddha, with each different names and titles. There are also not Buddha there in Nirvana and there are A LOT of different levels at there. Buddha is the highest title,  when below it is Bodhisattva(\u83e9\u8428) which have also have a whole lot more famous ones. The two most well known Bodhisattva are Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva \u5357\u65e0\u5927\u6148\u5927\u60b2\u89c2\u4e16\u97f3\u83e9\u8428, and K\u1e63itigarbha Bodhisattva, the Bodhisattva of the Great Vow \u5357\u65e0\u5927\u613f\u5730\u85cf\u738b\u83e9\u8428. Ask any Chinese and most will know who these two are, as both are widely worshipped. \n\nI know a bit more of the lore about Buddhism, as I am a Buddhist myself ( not too enthusiastic, am too lazy, god help me) and I read a few sutras. The sutras basically are stories about the Buddhism,  what someone had done, what them had said, and teaches how and why you should do and not should do.",

              "text": "The stuff about men and women is a pretty complex/controversial topic. In fact Buddhism was quite forward thinking about this stuff. In that there was actually a monastic foundation for women (which was a pretty big deal ~500 BC). Even in Theravada it's stated that women can attain enlightenment, according to the Buddha. Though there is a passage saying that a woman could not be a buddha specifically. However, there is a certain amount of evidence derived from comparing texts that shows that this is probably a later addition to the Pali canon (the Theravadan texts). Mahayana is a different beast and there's a sutra explicitly stating that gender doesn't really matter so much. Of course this doesn't mean that there aren't problems with misogyny within Buddhist countries or traditions. For instance there are no female monastics in Thailand (I believe the argument these days has to do with ordination things). However, the textual basis and positions about this are not as clear cut as you have made them out to be.\n\n\nHonestly this post reads as someone with a very passing familiarity with Theravadan Buddhism and so there's some misunderstandings baked into it about Buddhist theology and worldview.",

Nowhere in Theravada teachings it says you have to be a male Buddhist monk to reach nibbana. You don't have to be *anything*, not a monk, not a man, not even a Buddhist. You just have to follow the correct path of practice, and you'll get there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> after a few hundred lifetimes\n\nPeople *really* undermine the way samsara is described in pali canon. How long it is. It is more like so many lifetimes that you cannot count how many times you were born and born again. Like every living being has been your mother, father, child, sibling, lover or a sworn enemy at least once in some lifetime. Like there is no pleasure or suffering you can imagine that you have not experienced somewhere in asome lifetime. The length of samsara is said to be unfathomable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>the Buddha thought men were closer to Nirvana because women were too emotional and volatile\n\n\r  \nThis is false. Buddha specifically said women are equally capable of reaching enlightenment as men.\r  \n\r  \nBuddha's hesitance in establishing the nun's order was not because women were \"emotional and volatile\", but because of the prevailing social constraints in India at the time. Buddha was revolutionary in that era in admitting women's equal ability in spiritual advancement as men.\r  \n\r  \n\n\n>To this day, the Sangha (the body of Buddhist clergy) debates whether or not nuns are truly sacred\n\n\r  \nNuns are part of the Sangha community as much as monks. No one debates how venerable nuns are. Buddha's list of greatest disciples includes nuns as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>the Buddha died from food poisoning after eating spoiled pork.\r  \n\r\n\nThis is a misconception. Buddha was sick for some time before with dysentery with evacuation of blood (lohita-pakkandika). Three months earlier he had declared that he would be passing away in three months. The last meal did not cause Buddha's demise. He specifically assured the man who offered him the meal that it was not the case.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Nirvana is when your soul is not reincarnated at all\n\nBuddhism rejects the concept of a permanent soul.",

The heir thought it ate her so he killed it and stabbed himself, spraying blood all over a bush. She came back because she didn\u2019t want to miss seeing him and saw him dead. She took his sword and did the same thing. Their blood ended up permanently staining the berries on the bush red as blood. Also the warring families reconciled.\n\nAka the plot of Romeo and Juliet but with less lions.",

I wonder why I've never realized that before.\"\n\nMaybe, just *MAYBE,* there's another reason people across the planet could share similar shades of skin?  Like UV exposure?

There are no statues or paintings of the Buddha when he would have been alive. These statues are an artists rendition of him based on the Buddhist literature. They were made centuries after he would have been alive. Coincidentally, the literature the artist based their statue from explicitly states that he shaved his head and snails crawled up there. There\u2019s no contention (like at all) about if he had curly hair or whatever in the Buddhist stories. This conversation we\u2019re having right now originated from someone who recently saw a picture of Bantu hair and a picture of a Buddha statue and (without knowing anything about the Buddha or Buddhism like at all) concluded they were the same.

So if someone is taking such an oath, you could imagine they'd tie back or braid their hair for convenience, and over time it would get matted. But unless your hair is thick and curly (which probably isn't the case for most people indigenous to Scandinavia) it's not gonna form into locks unless you deliberately treat it (usually done by back-combing, which obviously you can't do under the oath).\n\nAnd the fact that this oath was apparently a thing suggests that, if you're *not* taking such an oath, the norm was to keep your hair trimmed at a certain length and neatly combed.",

Even under the Bodhi tree, where he finds enlightenment, and where most photos of him are depicted, he was out of ascetism for quite some time. He also sat under that tree for 49 days, in which I doubt he shaved his head. He also never followed Hinduism, which at the time was the religion where monks shaved their heads. The only study I know of where he cuts his hair, is when he cuts his pony tail to abandon his elegant way of life. After that he is seen with a small bun on his head.",

The earlier written records date back to centuries after his death, when it comes to the history all we can do is speculate.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that he had very short hair. Monks are allowed to grow out their hair to couple knuckles\u2019 length. But all the monks I\u2019ve met keep their head shaven. And when they cut their hair it must be shaven completely.\n\nDespite the depictions in statues and art if you ask any Buddhist monk they will either tell you, yes the Buddha had a shaved, head or you should be focusing more the Buddha\u2019s teaching that the Buddha himself.",

And on the other side, if you were not a citizen and didn\u2019t speak Latin, you were a barbarian. No matter what skin color you had. TL;DR. These folks are using modern interpretations of race and applying them to a historical context when those interpretations didn\u2019t exist.",

But there are always certain artistic distinctions that make it very apparent that the art piece you are looking at is the original Buddha. Snail shell hair, top knot, elongated ears, forehead dimple, and very specific types of poses known as mudras that symbolize different philosophical teachings or historical events. \n\nObviously, Buddhism originated not in Ethiopia, but more likely what is modern day India. Since it was a very popular religion that traveled all across Asia and then some, it\u2019s equally not unlikely that there were practicing Buddhists in Ethiopia. Within every culture that practiced Buddhism, the artists would definitely depict the Buddha to look more like whatever ethnic/racial people that lived in the area i.e. Chinese Buddhists made him look Chinese, Indian Buddhists Indian, etc etc. \n\nIn the lore of Buddhism his top knot is actually not hair, but part of his skull to account for all of the extra brain he has, and the hair? 108 snails that crawled on his head and dried so that they could protect his delicate lopsided head from getting burnt in the sun",

While other pieces of the lineage, think Neanderthals,  Denesovins etc left before and are related to us, they\u2019re not Homo sapiens. All Homo sapiens were black and lived in Africa.

They've killed Egyptians before, as well as people from other groups they want to culturally appropriate.

Like Jesus!\n\nHowever, the assertion of the meme, that this hair style is some sort of definitive proof or indication that he was Ethiopian, is misleading at best. Humanity brought more than just cows, chickens and pigs when they left Africa; many cultural and behavioural practices came with them.\nThis hair style is common in ancient renderings as far as Japan, which is about as far from Africa as you can go while remaining in Asia.",

Arabs are a mixed group of people who have taken all kinds of people into their population. Where did Mohammed go when he sought refuge on one of his military campaigns?  Ethiopia.  He was of Ethiopian descent.  So all these biracial people you see running around.  They still have African roots.  There is a way to debate respectively with out name calling, I encourage you to practice that, and then you can be taken more seriously.",

It's just sad and depressing hearing this from an Egyptian, and I understand why Nubian people suffer and are denigrated.

People who have this kind of take are often the most heavily dependant on their preferred choice of media; be it 4chan, Reddit, Twitter, or Fox News. You'd shrivel and wither without your ability to be shitty to people from behind your little black screen.\n\n2) while media can influence attitudes and culture, the opposite can also be true. It's not a one way street and media often attempts to reflect the values of the culture. The fact you think media is an amalgamation of racial coding more reflects your own warped, narrow, and ignorant worldview more than it says anything about the media in question.\n\n3) get fucked you salty racist dipshit.\n\nEdit: one day old account and all they do is bitch and whine about identity politics. 99% sure this is some angry incel who's fresh off a previous ban. Would be a shame if his posts got reported and he was banned again... A reaaaaal shame.",
