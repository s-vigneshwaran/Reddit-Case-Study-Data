Or even after having a baby? You get leave through FMLA only if you work for a company with 50 employees or more. It's unpaid, so many mothers have to go back before they really get to heal or bond for financial reasons. Additionally, there is the pressure of having to get back because \"competition\", especially with men and other people who are not ready to have kids. My cousin got 3 weeks after a C section, and the 3rd week she was working from home or \"there are other people who can do what you do and we might eliminate your position\". \n\nThis last bit impacts women the most, because daycare is a necessity. Work rarely covers it. Fathers / another spouse /parent aren't always around. \n\nIt's infuriating and a sickness of our society.",

Jokes on me I already am for other stuff.\n\nYour plan sounds like what I would have liked to do if I didn't have extreme reactions to progesterone which I found out the hard way after getting the depo shot while I was on college.\n\nBut oh God I had something like that nightmare period you speak of once randomly. I don't know why. And at this point with how dismissive doctors have been about my menstrual issues I never bothered to go to the doctor for it.  It's probably fine \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\ude36\n\nI'd been really ill for months around that time and lost like 30 pounds despite eating the most lavishly I'd eaten in my entire life and actually not worrying about weight for once. So idk what I weighed when I had it happened but I was likely around 105lbs. \n\nThen it happened.\n\nI stayed up all night literally screaming and crying in my bed. But that's normal for me but idk it just somehow felt different. Plus I didn't have any ibuprofen and lived rurally enough that there was no way I was able to get any meds that night. But since that type of pain is normal I was just carrying on with getting ready for work when I go to the bathroom and notice I had literally sloughed off my entire uterine lining in one go. \n\nIt looked like a biological 3d printer had deposited a little printing of the negative space of a uterus onto my ultra heavy super flow overnight pad with wings (elaboration on the pad name for the humor but also if I could buy something that big/absorbent I would. Shit I've thought about buying depends and seeing if they work for periods).\n\nOk weird but I gotta get to work.\n\nWas pale and sweaty and in the same amount of pain when I got to work and my department manager looked at me and was like \"dude.... Go. Home. Now.  You have so much ppto banked up and I'm here so we'll be staffed and even if I wasn't here you definitely shouldn't be here. Let me know if you need me to help you figure out a ride home if you can't drive. Go see a fucking doctor!\"\n\nI ended up, at 30 years old, calling my mom to get me from work because of the weirdest menstrual cycle of my life.\n\nNo, it wasn't miscarriage because I weren't fucking for a few years around then. \n\nI did some light googling and found out that endometrial casts are a thing. And they're fucked. I used to wish I could just get it out all at once. Welp I got what I wished for and it was a nightmare. Let's not do that again, please.\n\nFor pain reference, I have really huge kidney stones (6+mm) but took forever to diagnose them because I \"wasn't in enough pain\" (often misdiagnosed as pyelonephritis/kidney infection because I have a history of that) but I base my pain meter off menstruation pain levels so if it hurts less or equal to a period it's fine and if it hurts more maybe I'll think about seeing a doctor but likely pass because I don't want to spend the time or money being dismissed about my health concerns. In fact, for a while I just assumed kidney stone pain was non-crampy menstrual pain so I mostly ignored it because I have a bad reaction to certain hormonal birth controls and that's the only thing my female doctors ever recommend when I have gone in about my menstrual issues.\n\nWe have a history of endometriosis and PCOS in my family but the doctors won't even consider looking into if I have those. My current doctor was like \"have you read about anything online lately that you're concerned about? Go see a psychiatrist because you have a history of anxiety and depression.\". It's probably fine. Lol rip\n\n\nBut, really, if I could within reason (and affordably) do it I'd nix this shit ASAP and just never reproduce because fuck this.",

We were graded based on whether or not we wrote a full page for the journal prompts she gave us, which were often completely unrelated to health. I think she just wanted *something* to grade us on so that she could pretend she was teaching, because she clearly didn't read them (I know, because nobody ever got into any trouble for the awful things we wrote about her in our journals).\n\nThen I got to high school and our health curriculum assumed we had at least a bare-minimum level of sex ed in middle school, and so it never covered things like basic reproductive anatomy.",

Satire was a potential seed of doubt that had the power to make people question their opinion or belief long enough to perhaps change their mind or at least be able to justify it better in future discourse.\n\nI feel like today the ones being made fun of can\u2019t even tell that\u2019s the case and may even get a sense of validation from the satire. Those on the other side want to think it\u2019s a joke and have a therapeutic laugh with a likeminded person but they can\u2019t be sure if it\u2019s satire or one of the many morons that can and do believe absolutely nutty shit.\n\nSo at best satire just adds to the barrage of useless noise we all sift through every day.

When that doesn't happen, hormones tell it to break down and it bleeds out through the vagina - that's what a period is.\"\n\n(Most guys either know or accept this first part without issue, but it's essential knowledge to have when describing endometriosis).\n\n>\"The problem is, I have endometrial cells outside the uterus; they are in other parts of my body, and on my organs. These cells also respond to the hormones, so when it comes time for the period to happen, they also break down and bleed, but there's *nowhere for the blood to exit* and so I just end up **bleeding interally**. The blood has nowhere to go except into my body cavity, where it's not supposed to be. That's why it hurts so much.\"\n\n(If they inquire further, I'll add this next bit).\n\n>\"The blood gets cleared eventually, but it irritates my organs and causes scarring which can cause them to eventually get sutured together with scar tissue. That's one reason endometriosis can cause problems with fertility. It really sucks.\"\n\nThe look of horror on my male friends' faces has been honestly shocking to me, so I think it does a good job of describing the severity of the problem. They know I don't die from it, but \"I pass out/vomit from pain because I'm bleeding into my body cavity\" makes more sense to them than \"I pass out/vomit from pain because of my period (which lots of other women have with no issue), and here is a long confusing word for my brand of gross period weakness.\"",

That's why I mentioned disabled people, a leg  amputee will sure have problems as a delivery guy, that doesn't mean he can't be a successful painter or a programmer. Even this guy can admit his mistake and end up being a successful leader.\n\nIdk what people is understanding from this... I believe success is being proficient at what you do, I'll leave that clear, if I'm wrong let me know why. My main point was that even stupid people deserves some success. Moving on:\n\nNon-proficiency doesn't absolutely leads to genocide, I exposed the case where this guy showed aptitude at painting but being denied the opportunity deprived him from any deserved success he could have and I think that's bad (I just showed a worse case scenario).\n\nNow, out of the nutshell, I believe everybody has at least some aptitudes that makes one good at something, being stupid is super subjective and every stupid person is a genius in other fields. Because you're good at something there's now somewhere where you do deserve to be successfull, because if that's not true then your life is done; that jump of logic you're quoting is me saying that if you're undeserving of any success in your life, then you'll end up useless to the world. Everybody deserves to be successful somewhere.\n\nDon't try to insult me, you don't even know me, insult what I'm saying, let's see if you can come up with an intelligent one. If I'm wrong, and if I consider you to be stupid are you absolutely doomed to not achieve success anywhere?",

A lot of people suffer from PCOS or Endometriosis and getting diagnosed can be difficult because the tests for these can get pretty expensive or you're told from childhood that the pain you're experiencing is normal.\n\nI went in a couple of years ago to get tested for Endo. Blood tests alone would cost anywhere from 150-300, ultrasound was going to cost me roughly 500. With insurance. That is just not affordable to many people. I have had extremely debilitating and painful periods so bad I vomit sometimes since I first got my period. I told my mom how painful it was when I was a teenager, and she said, \"well, that happens to everyone\".\n\nA lot of people do attempt diagnosis and are refused/dismissed, are told it is normal to be in that much pain, or realize how expensive it actually is to get diagnosed. A lot of people are told that being in that amount of pain is actually normal from a young age. It can actually be pretty difficult to get a proper diagnosis because a lot of health issues related to women do not get taken very seriously, generally speaking. [W](https://www.healthywomen.org/condition/pain-gap-womens-pain-undertreated)[omen's pain is treated as being less severe than men's](https://www.healthywomen.org/condition/pain-gap-womens-pain-undertreated), which makes it much more difficult to discuss chronic pain as it relates to women's health.\n\nAdd to all of this that despite being pervasive chronic pain disorders, Endo and PCOS are not considered disabilities. So, even if you were to not work due to the potential severity of pain from these, there is nothing protect you from getting fired for missing work even with doctor's notes. I have seen a few women with either of these be unable to hold jobs or get fired on more than one occasion due to the pain. So sometimes, even if you are diagnosed it does not matter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit to add: Not trying to argue, but just provide a bit more context and examples to further your point.",

And I support paid maternity leave - this supports both men & women. \n\nBut I really can't support a difference in paid sick leave between males and females.

      "text": "You know as a woman I'm not offended by that. I do believe people should respect each other 100%. People should be nice and pleasant to one another and professional in their workplace. Now let's just address the little issue of menstrual leave,  since when is this a thing? Sounds to me like somebody needs to put their big girl panties on and suck it up. And I am a person who has a painful time of the month and when I say painful, if you've ever given birth you know what pain is. \nNow I can't get on to my sisters without getting onto my brothers now men hear this .... you should truly, truly respect something that can bleed for 7 days and not die. Until you have experienced true pain AKA childbirth shut up about menstruation ,just shut up about it. You have absolutely no clue what you're even talking about because you know what you haven't ever experienced it. Most women do not suffer horribly with it ,but there are some women out there the first few days it is so painful all you can do is lay in the bathtub & nothing touches the pain no amount of MIDOL you take ,no amount of  heavy hitting painkillers IS going to help you .So, until you've actually experienced it (I wish this entire world would put their selves in another person's shoes for 2 minutes because I guarantee you ,you'd have a different approach it's called empathy) SHUT YOUR MOUTH ABOUT SOMETHING YOU KNOW NOT ONE THING ABOUT. No ,I don't believe this should be used as a way to just sit at home during your period . Grow the hell up . Some  women truly do suffer and I'm one of them so I can say this to you. Stop being whiny tits, stop trying to get something for nothing and be an adult. I have felt like I was going to die and I still had to chase after my kids make lunch I might have been laying down in between but I still had to do for another human being. This is the problem in society. We like to point our fingers ,we like to judge ,we like to be plain out shitty to one another and we think we have the right to because of social media platforms. YOU 100% DO NOT HAVE THAT RIGHT! I hate to tell you ,but you are supposed to treat other people the way you want to be treated ,not the way you feel like treating them. Let me put it a little more in context for you .Say you are fortunate enough to have a maid or a housekeeper ,you should treat that person the way you want to be treated. Do you want to be treated with respect I'm fairly sure you do and that's vice versa. If you are a maid or a housekeeper you should treat your employer with the same respect you want to be treated with. WE ARE AN ENTITLED SOCIETY. We think we have the right to treat people the way we want to treat them. a WE BELIEVE WE HAVE THE RIGHTS TO say whatever we want to them because we have freedom of speech. YOU KNOW SOMETIMES FREEDOM OF SPEECH meanS SHUTTING THE HELL UP! RANT OVER MIC DROP",

If you're unwilling to accommodate then you're not providing equality opportunity.\n\nA person in a wheelchair doesn't have equal opportunity if they have to climb stairs, so we accommodate them with ramps and wheelchair accessible bathroom stalls. I don't see you complaining about that.\n\nWomen, with their unique needs, do not have equal opportunity if we deny them leave for maternity, and yes, even for cases of complications with mensuration. Relatively few women experience excessive pain during mensuration, it's not even particularly common, so why not accommodate it?\n\nAnyway, your opinion is nothing more than sexist, which of course is the opposite of equality. Let me put it to you this way. If 5% - 10% of  penises cramped up for three days each month to the point you couldn't walk and it was literally making you throw up, we'd have accommodation for those men. Hell, it would probably be burned into the constitution!",

However if the pain is too bad there should be a system in place for them to take some additional time off if need be, I mean it's not exactly something they could help, and it does happen monthly. \n\nAnd in general I just think sick leave should be paid at most jobs. If I am gonna dedicate 40 hours of my life a week, or 1/2 of my free time out side of sleeping for a company, then I don't paid sick leave is unfair. Sick days shouldn't something that people are unable to take if they need too, but so many can't because they simply can't afford it and that's wrong. Either that or just up the pay so that way missing one day isn't as significant of a financial blow but businesses have already shown the aren't willing to even do that",
