Like, you might have an undefeated 'season', but there isn't like a top game or anything.  At least not that I remember. \n\nIt wasn't until I was ~12 and playing on a travelling team in a league (soccer) that we won an actual trophy, prior to that it was participation trophies because the league wasn't set up to have winners or losers, not in a PC \"we are all winners\" kind of way, more of just kids those ages don't really understand or care about that kind of thing, and it's a social/exercise effort more than anything.  \n\nAlso, a cheap ass trophy to commemorate the season in your life is generally part of the end of the season \"pizza party\" the team has.  It  never made me feel like I deserved a trophy for just participating, but, at the same time, it's a small lesson in 'work'.   You work for the season, you get a shitty piece of compensation for your time/effort.  \n\nI'm in my mid 30s, I'm sure I still have some of those trophies, but the things I enjoy holding onto are the team pictures from the time more than the pictures, as I'm still friends with a number of people I played with at that age.  And even then it's not like I go back to look at them, I stumble upon them while looking for a specific charger through boxes at my parents house or something and might snap a picture and send it to a friend, and that's like, maximum effort, usually I don't even look at it.  \n\nLike, I grew up as a kid through the 90s, it was generally a prosperous economic time, where my parents biggest expectation for me in my life was going to college, because if I got a college degree I would be set for a successful life.  Well, I got a bachelors in 2008, and, at that point it didn't really matter if I had a degree or not, there weren't any jobs.  Hell, I went and did a PhD, and even then it theoretically means I can get a high paying long lasting job, I guess, but the reality isn't quite that.  All of my siblings have at least a bachelors, as well as either a graduate degree or accreditation.  I'm the only one doing anything close to what my degrees are in, and to that extent it's basically relevant because of my experience in scientific publishing, like, specifically publishing, not the actual science or getting the data, that is irrelevant to what I do, basically it's knowing how to format documents in Word/Excel, which, I really don't need a PhD to do.  Like, there isn't really any specific cross over from any of my education to what I do now, outside of the pandemic.",
