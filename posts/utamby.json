One of my co-workers came to my desk and asked me if I was aware of what my picture was on whatsapp. I use whatsapp very rarely, mostly with friends if we are not using other apps available i.e. Snapchat. I had to check as I had not been on whatsapp in a while. So I open whatsapp to check my picture and felt like throwing up.\n\nSo the story behind my whatsapp profile picture is that I saw it on Twitter, showed it to my friends because I thought it was hilarious. One of them said I wouldn't set it at my profile picture, and I said bet. So I set it on an app I never use and completely forgot about it. The picture is a very detailed and pornographic image of Iron Man and Captain America having sex. Picture Attached: [WhatsApp Picture (NSFW)](https://imgur.com/a/MzTNCpr)\n\nOnce I saw it, I immediately changed it to the most professional picture of me I could find. As I'm panicking and not knowing what to do, wanting to change my identity - a co-worker comes up to me who usually chats with me and is very friendly with me could not even look me in the eyes. My boss saw this picture, all my co-workers saw this picture, I feel like I have scarred these older people for life.\n\nTomorrow I have to go back to work and I don't know what to expect or what to do.\n\nTL;DR\n\nMy co-workers saw a pornographic image which was set as my profile picture on whatsapp.\n\nUpdate: [https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/uu5g8o/tifu\\_by\\_joining\\_my\\_work\\_groupchat\\_and\\_now\\_i\\_feel/](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/uu5g8o/tifu_by_joining_my_work_groupchat_and_now_i_feel/)\n\nHere is a link to me telling the friends mentioned about the whole situation for anyone wondering of the aftermath: [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1490361790](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1490361790)",

MN always ranks high on the list of states to live.\n\nYea at least we're not Wisconsin I guess.",

Talk about it like a funny story. Tell people what you told us - that it was a bet/dare/joke. Laugh at yourself for doing something stupid (your coworkers are all adults, and they\u2019ve *all* made embarrassing mistakes). Be self-deprecating but upbeat. Make light of the situation, instead of letting it fester and become something people are awkwardly silent about.\n\nSome people will still be too uncomfortable to laugh. That\u2019s okay, too. Sincerely apologize to anyone who needs to hear it.\n\nEven once you\u2019ve already decided what to do, go to your boss first thing in the morning and ask their advice. What they say isn\u2019t really the point, though. The simple act of asking is itself the point. Bosses *love* being asked to share their thoughts, and just by doing so, you\u2019ll show that you\u2019re thoughtful, concerned, and appreciate their input. You might even come out of this looking better than you did at the start of the week. \n\nI don\u2019t think anyone is judging you as harshly as you are yourself. I wish you the best!\n\nEdit: this is crazy! I\u2019ve never gotten anywhere near this many awards! Thanks, everyone!",

It\u2019s how you *handle* that mistake that people remember.\n\nLying, dodging responsibility, and half-assed attempts at a solution don\u2019t work in the long term. Facing a problem directly, owning up to what you did, (maybe) taking some shit for it, and helping solve it matters more than people realize. It shows that you have integrity, humility, and a sense of responsibility. As a bonus, people are a lot more likely to say \u201cwell, accidents happen\u201d than carry a grudge. That\u2019s especially important in a work environment like OPs.",

Retirement/nursing homes are full of old ass people doing the nasty all the time and giving each other communicable diseases. Seriously, it's a problem. The visiting nurse (I work with) told me that she would bring handfuls of condoms to the old folks residences. There is no age limit to being passionate, to feeling sexy and sexual & want to look at porno or hang erotic images or gods forbid fuck the dentures right out of someone, to be pleasured or to pleasure a lover.

I only mentioned that demographic because the age range of 40s & 50s was brought up in the post. \n\nI said it tongue in cheek, but that obviously didn't come across in text. \n\nHaving been on forums of women going through peri menopause or in menopause, looking for advice on getting doctors to treat you, I've seen that there are plenty of women in this age bracket who are fed up with the life they feel stuck in with unsupportive husbands. Also, just as many heterosexual men find sex between two women to be exciting, many heterosexual women enjoy sex scenes on TV between two men (I do).\n\nSorry my comment wasn't clear in it's intent to be humorous. I've always had a high sex drive and I expect to still have it into old age. \n\nI'm a bit confused by your assumption that looking at an erotic image *isn't* sexy or stimulating. Why you'd assume that we'd lose our sex drive but desire to look at erotic images? Personally I've always loved sex, and it's only got better as I've aged and learned about my body and what works.",

Religion probably plays a big part in it too for you Americans. \n\nI think it's a generalisation young people have about older people that they are all prudish and strict about this stuff.

One day, my coworker gets called into the principal\u2019s office because her daughter was looking up some very, *very* NSFW stuff on her school account. The principal showed her the time stamp, which was on a Saturday afternoon that past weekend. She said she turned bright red, muttered something about talking to her daughter, and left the room without meeting our boss\u2019s eye.\n\nI got the full story that afternoon. Her kids were gone for the weekend but apparently her daughter had logged into the school account on their home computer to do some homework before leaving on Friday, and never logged out. Since she and her husband had the house to themselves, they were looking at some *adult stuff* and enjoying their alone time.\n\nMy coworker\u2019s pretty sure our boss knew it was her/her husband because apparently the stuff she was looking up wasn\u2019t exactly anything an 8-year-old would know about. \n\nWhen she told me this story, I promptly gave her a lesson in how to use incognito mode.",

If you happen to be on a more comfortable basis with one or two people, you may be able to tell them the story and let them disdiminate it around the office for you, instrad of making a big deal about it. If your boss was in the group, you may wish to start there. Without knowing these people personally, it us teally hard to tell exactly what would be the best course of action.",

Immediately apologize for any discomfort or offense it may have caused.  Tell them exactly what you told us. I wouldn't address sexuality or pornography directly. Emphasize that you RARELY use WhatsApp. You only had it for a friend group international excursion that was being planned.  You could even go so far in saying that you deleted the app awhile ago (*AS LONG AS YOU ACTUALLY HAVE NOT USED IT IN A LONG TIME & DEFINITELY HAVE NOT COMMUNICATED WITH ANYONE FROM WORK OR ANYONE EVEN REMOTELY CONNECTED TO YOUR EMPLOYMENT) and only downloaded and signed in again because of this WORK RELATED conversation. Simply state it was an image that was shared on a superhero themed forum or something similar. State that you shared a conversation, comment.. whatever.. anything other than THAT image and that your friend, who was reading said conversation or comment had your phone and changed your avatar without your knowledge. Depending on the coworkers, if alcohol is an acceptable vice among them, it might be more sympathetic if you mention that played a role. Re-emphasize that you rarely use that app and forgot all about it. \n\nApologize, again,  profusely for any offense or discomfort it may have caused anyone involved. \n\nGo through any & all apps that have even the slightest possibility of being seen by and or used for company related anything and get rid of all things  remotely *offensive\" and set every single social media account to to secret. \n\nLet everyone involved know that you have replaced the image with a more professional one and, again,  apologize for your oversight and assure them you won't let anything like this happen in the future. (Don't say again.. say it won't happen in the future.. it just sounds less like your a habitual fuck up when eliminating the word *again*.)",

You hold your coworkers in esteem, are horribly embarrassed by it, and hope that we all can get past this.\n\nIf anyone heard about it, acknowledge how offensive it is, and give brief explanation along the same lines.\n\nHead on damage control is the very best, most effective way, if you ever want them to look at you again.  No other way of dealing will be remotely effective.\n\nHopefully they'll give you credit for having the guts to face it, condemn it too, and apologize.",

We are now entering a new age of humanity when employers WILL check your social media\u2026. And so will co-workers. \n\nTread lightly my friends",

Sorry to laugh at your misery but that image is golden.\n\nAlso the fact that our generation has the capability to traumatize older folks is hilarious to me. It's usually the older people who traumatize the younger ones, but our generation is somehow more fucked up then our elders. I had a similar situation where my mom found my porn on my phone when I was 16. I gave her my phone to make a phone call and back then smart phones were very new and touch wasn't very good nor accurate (it was a Nokia XM 5800), not to mention she wasn't tech savvy, so after she was done with the call she accidentally clicked on the gallery and found my porn. When she gave me back the phone she was shaking and I saw the porn on my screen. She didn't look me in the eye and looked terrified, and just walked away quickly without a word. I felt so bad back then not to mention embarrassed af, because my mom was such a pure person and was quite devout and religious, but now I find it hilarious.",

She is also extremely embarrassed but ultimately it\u2019s my account and I should have paid attention when I opened WhatsApp and made sure my account was accurate and up to date. I understand social media this is not how I normally do things. I am extremely sorry if I offended anyone. I know going forward many of you will get a good laugh at my expense and I deserve that. But I also hope you grant me some forgiveness for which going forward I plan on earning.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the standard take the responsibility. Then casually blame someone else, again take responsibility for something you didn\u2019t do, you just lacked diligence. Then fall on sword.

An early career female coworker of mine made a comment about young people and porn these days (the conversation was about social media and dangers for young people, and it came up), and after that I swear like half the guys we work with saw her in a different way. Like, she made a perfectly professional comment about it, but OMG SHE KNOWS WHAT PORN IS! I SHOULD TELL HER I ALSO LIKE PORN! MAYBE WE CAN MAKE SOME!",

Apologize for the inappropriate image, explain just as you did here that this was a joke with friends from a long time ago that you had forgotten about, and move on.  Best to be proactive about it, a simple email or even message in said group chat should suffice.  \n\nSomething like, \"I want to sincerely apologize for the incident yesterday in which everyone was exposed to an explicit image on my Whatsapp account.  This was the product of a joke with friends from some time ago; as it is an app I rarely use, I had forgotten about this picture and did not realize it was still there.  However, I understand this does not change that it was extremely inappropriate in the workplace, and please be assured that I will take every action to ensure nothing like this happens again.  I have learned a very tough lesson in professional vigilance, am extremely embarrassed, and hope you can all accept my apology and move on from the event.\"  Edit as needed to fit your tone and work environment.\n\nIt's best to be proactive with this and admit you made a mistake and take action to correct it BEFORE someone complains, the boss/HR gets involved, etc.  Even if it wouldn't escalate to that point, you still don't want to let it just fester and become the super awkward elephant in the room that forever ruins your relationship with coworkers and reputation at work.  To err is human; everyone is gonna fuck up at some points in their life.  But when you do, you gotta take responsibility for it.",

It was an after hours like 3am call and we had been on it for about 8 hours so got pretty comfortable with each other, he asked me if I bathed in Maple syrup, I asked him if he'd been to any good school shootings recently some good cross border banter as we slowly go insane on too much coffee and command line. \n\n\nAnyway the official file share was being a PITA so I was like look bro, here's a link to my personal Dropbox, I've got a good chunk of gigglebytes free because I was one of those people that profited massively when they ran the free storage for recommends whatever let's bypass the corp firewall and just use that. Cool cool cool. \n\nHis Dropbox name was Dick Tingle. The picture was the most homoerotic picture I'd ever seen. I was fucking dying. He was embarrased at first but took it in good faith, told me Dick Tingle was a sex author and we got very homoerotic over the phonecall. I wasn't even sure if he was gay or not and he wasn't about me either so it was stupidly funny. \n\nThat's fun and all bros talking shit who cares? Where it got hysterical was thanks to my in appropriate colleague in another time zone that knew I was doing after-hours work and decided to discreetly start a VC with the room I was in. Because the day was just starting there he wasn't alone in his office but apparently  had *his entire leadership* huddled around his monitor ready to shout BOO or some shit and scare me over the speakers. Instead they heard me (not vendor bro I had a headset on) saying exactly what my pleasure canal was going to do to his veiny love sausage. My tired brain saw the display come on and I thought, that's weird, even as I'm moaning and making slobbering noises into my mic. And then suddenly, as I'm watching the tv over my shoulder staring right into the room camera, I see my colleague, his manager, his managers manager and a couple of directors faces frozen in confused embarrassed horror. I just remember screaming no over and over apparently I looked like I was about to puke. Colleague started howling with laughter and the managers kinda disappeared. They were good sports as far as I can tell word didn't get back to my team from them but after telling the whole story I found a lot of emails would start with \n\nHi Mr Tingle,\n\nThe asshole kept changing my exchange name to Richard Tingle!\n\n\nGood times.",

She didn't take it into consideration before messaging me on Hangouts/Google Chat.  \n\nNeedless to say we've never really \"discussed\" that sort of stuff 'cause it's obviously embarrassing, but IDGAF, her interests are her own.  \n\nShe did find out her dad knows what Yaoi, ecchi, yuri, and all those other \"hentai\" subgenres are that day though.  \n\nGranted it's not exactly the same, but it happens to the best of us. At least you changed it as soon as you realized and didn't say something like \"Don't worry, I'm not actually having an animated fling with two hot-ass superheros\" like that \"Cat-Lawyer\" guy did xD.",

Can't change any of that now... probably not worth worrying over too much.\n\nThere aren't a lot of safeguards protecting our personal online identities from getting muddied up with our professional digital identities - but as a rule of thumb - don't use PERSONAL accounts for professional things - and that will go a long way to avoiding these kind of unpleasant experiences.\n\nMy personal accounts, registered through my personal e-mail, are mine.\n\nIf a company wants me to use an app or service or whatever - I've got a company e-mail... I register a new account with that e-mail, and I use that. Once I leave the company, I leave all of those accounts. They're basically burner accounts. Keep your personal digital life completely separate from your professional one.\n\nRecently I was working for a temp agency, and they initiated contact with me through my contract via my personal e-mail. This caused problems later when both the contractor who hired me and the temp agency staff would send me e-mail with deadlines on my PERSONAL e-mail. When they complained about me not responding, I explained, \"You sent this to my personal e-mail. I asked you to send any correspondence to the work e-mail I was assigned during this job, as I don't check personal accounts during the day when I'm on the clock, often even during breaks or lunch.\" You can't really get upset at an employee for going, \"I didn't get that because I only use work related tools when I'm on the clock and you sent it to my personal account.\"\n\nMake this a religious habit - and you'll never have THIS problem again.  \n\n\nAlso, an an IT engineer - I have HUGE insight into what you do on any device connected through any company service, device, network. I see the e-mails you send to your boyfriend... and your husband, minutes apart. I can get logs of your chat sessions with other employees, I can monitor all the traffic on your company provided internet connection, I can listen in on your phone calls - I probably have all kinds of control over your company provided cell phone. It isn't that I creep on you - but part of my job is to actually audit things - and in auditing - I'll see subject lines or other information that tells me MORE ABOUT YOU than I'd like to know. I have access to everything on your shared drive - I have to in order to back it up, and so those spring break pictures of you passed out topless in your hotel room in a puddle of your own puke - yup... everyone in the IT department has seen them. Mostly because we were trying to figure out what was taking up so much space on the backups, realized it was the shared drives, and then found that everyone was storing their camera images and music collections on the company shares.   \n\n\nThis kind of thing happens all the time. Keep your personal stuff personal - including not using your company laptop for personal use. Have your OWN laptop and just use the company laptop for company business. Have your OWN cellphone and just use the company cell phone for company business. I even go so far as to have my company put in a separate Internet Service provider's service that I use ONLY for company related things - and I maintain my own regular ISP for internet, TV, gaming, whatever personal things I do.",

Sorry but as someone who this has happened to I find this hilarious, hopefully you will too someday.\n\nMy story: I owned a daycare and preschool, but not just a regular one. I took in kids who had been kicked out of \"normal\" daycares for behavior problems. I charged a lot and did not offer subsidies, ie: the families I served were typically well off. \nPart of my programming was \"Mom's Night\" were I would host an evening out, usually some event followed by a drink. One night it was drinks. I of course stayed relatively sober, but a couple moms had a bit more than I.\n\nOne of the moms grabbed my phone and changed my BBM (Blackberry Messenger, this was a few years ago) user name to \"Tits McGee\". I saw it right away and we all had a giggle, then I forgot about it.\n\nA few weeks later I had a couple spots open up and started messaging families from my waitlist, all through BBM. Three families passed, which I thought was strange as they had been waiting for a while. The fourth accepted immediately so I didn't think much of it and invited them over to finalize plans and contracts. \n\nThe kids went outside to play and we sat down at the table, but both parents were acting a bit strange. I saw them trading glances and odd looks. Finally the mom brings out her phone and says \"before we move further I'd like to ask about your nickname meaning\". I look at her phone and see our previous conversation with Tits McGee across the top of the screen. I  explained and we all had a laugh. The mom said she hoped it was something like that because it  showed we were \"their kind of people\", the husband was worried I had a side business not conducive to child care. Crisis averted.\n\nThat mom became a very close friend, the one who changed my name is now my sister-in-law.",

Immediately apologize for any discomfort or offense it may have caused.  Tell them exactly what you told us. I wouldn't address sexuality or pornography directly. Emphasize that you RARELY use WhatsApp. You only had it for a friend group international excursion that was being planned.  You could even go so far in saying that you deleted the app awhile ago (*AS LONG AS YOU ACTUALLY HAVE NOT USED IT IN A LONG TIME & DEFINITELY HAVE NOT COMMUNICATED WITH ANYONE FROM WORK OR ANYONE EVEN REMOTELY CONNECTED TO YOUR EMPLOYMENT) and only downloaded and signed in again because of this WORK RELATED conversation. Simply state it was an image that was shared on a superhero themed forum or something similar. State that you shared a conversation, comment.. whatever.. anything other than THAT image and that your friend, who was reading said conversation or comment had your phone and changed your avatar without your knowledge. Depending on the coworkers, if alcohol is an acceptable vice among them, it might be more sympathetic if you mention that played a role. Re-emphasize that you rarely use that app and forgot all about it. \n\nApologize, again,  profusely for any offense or discomfort it may have caused anyone involved. \n\nGo through any & all apps that have even the slightest possibility of being seen by and or used for company related anything and get rid of all things  remotely *offensive\" and set every single social media account to to secret. \n\nLet everyone involved know that you have replaced the image with a more professional one and, again,  apologize for your oversight and assure them you won't let anything like this happen in the future. (Don't say again.. say it won't happen in the future.. it just sounds less like your a habitual fuck up when eliminating the word *again*.)",

When he was in his early 20s his boss wanted everyone to log into some group chat through Google, so he did and then A) got reminded exactly what his email was B) realized all his coworkers could see it. He was also the youngest person on the job, like you. He got through it by going, \"Oh shit sorry everybody I had a dumb sense of humor as a kid\" and moving along. His boss teased him about it a bit but it wasn't the end of the world.",

I then texted it to the coworker, or so I thought, but I accidentally sent the dirty audio file without even realizing it existed.

My phone had saved each in the same format with similar names.\n\nI remember panicking for a few minutes before I just texted the coworker and asked them to not listen to it and delete it b/c it was personal. I then sent them the correct voicemail I had originally meant to send.\n\nThey said they hadn't listened to it and deleted it, and I trust them, but part me of course always wonders if they just listened to it out of curiosity.",
