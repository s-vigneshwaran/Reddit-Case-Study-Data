I mean, that strategy achieved more or less every GQP goal over the past 40 years of my life. Time and again, we've capitulated to them, hoping that there was some Vaderesque core of good in them, but in the end they were Palpatine all along.\n\nThe current GOP, as it is, consists of perhaps 3 individuals---Romney, ~~McCain~~Cheney, Kinzinger----who are redeemable. The rest would be better off out of office, regardless of how that happened.\n\nAt a certain point, when you have power, you use it, and completely, without mercy or consideration for the other side. We do need more progressives to vote, preferably before the vote no longer matters due to GQP fully realizing their strategy, because after that nothing short of armed conflict or a complete work stoppage would fix the problem. When we do have that power, you enact it completely, no matter what crying and moaning comes from the other side. You crush them totally and enact your vision; if you are wrong, then your vision will be destroyed in the same way. If you're right, no one will be upset of your victory.\n\nThis is how the GOP operates. It is very effective. We might have to start playing the game that \\*IS being played, versus the way we wish it were played, or should be played.\n\nVoting is by far the preferred way for change, but not the only way, as history has shown many times. Shit, just a year and a half ago, the dumbest Americans tried it. I'm just glad they sucked at it.",

Every Madison Cawthorn sign I have seen lasts about 12 minutes before being run over.\n\nThere is a vast hunting group in Madison County. If there is one Republican view that Madison republicans lean on, it's guns. They see Cawthorn using them as toys and cries for attention. The bravery they thought he had regarding his car accident turned out to be a lie. His time in the military turned out to be a lie. Everyone sees him as a fraud now. I've seen a lot of republican favor in Chuck Edwards here. I've also seen Republicans not even running against him have multiple political ads against him, such as Ted Budd.\n\nThere is a disturbing website full of whacky, pro-russian, pro-trump, Qanon garbage conspiracy theories called savemadisoncounty.org. They claim that Democrats are slaughtering babies for fun, spend an awful lot of time accusing a sheriff of covering a rape and then burning down the police department, despite the building's small fire causing it to be up again in like two weeks, and says Putin is out fighting Obama's Deep State in Ukraine. And yet EVEN THEY hate Cawthorn. Multiple articles bashing him.\n\nDemocrats hate Cawthorn. Republicans hate Cawthorn. QAnon hates Cawthorn.\n\nI don't see him winning, but god don't let this comment end up on r/agedlikemilk.",

Plus as you admitted, he did say any white supremacists were bad. First it\u2019s \u201che said white supremacists were fine people and refused to condemn them\u201d then when people start throwing the clip of him saying they are bad people start doubling down with \u201cyeah well he didn\u2019t condemn them hard enough\u201d. \n\nHe literally said \u201ci\u2019m not talking about the bro nazis or the white nationalists because they should be condemned totally, but you had many other people in that group also who were not now nazis or white supremacists but the media treated them unfairly. In the other group also, you had fine people but you also had trouble makers\u2026.\u201d. Pretty clear cut but people still acting like \u201coh he supports neo nazis\u201d. \n\nThis whole thing reeks of bias and a wanting to interpret his words and intentions a certain way because you don\u2019t like him. \n\nHis whole point was that both sides had a part of the blame for the violence because the media was spinning a narrative of nazis and white supremacists running around attacking people and trump calling them fine people. The political bias and selective perception in this country is too damn high. The man could say X is good and they\u2019ll somehow spin it into \u201che implied Y is bad!\u201d",

For pretty much anyone employed by the VA it is just a government job. \n\nThe independent contractors that work with the VA is another story.  Personal experience we had to buy about $300k of medical equipment. We had the quotes lined up and ready to buy it direct from the manufacturer. Then some company down in Texas found out we were in the market and contacts us.  He is an authorized seller of the same equipment.  He also informs us that the VA has an obligation to buy the equipment through him as he is a veteran.  Turns out there is some policy with the VA that they have to give contracts to veteran owned businesses as long as they are within 20% of the lowest bid or something like that.  This guy marked his prices up exactly within the amount he could to still win the bid.  He got paid like $60,000 just to place an order after we had already done the work with the regular manufacturer.  It cost the VA extra and this dude made a fat check to do no work and just be an asshole.",

Also, most of the reason that Dems CANT do anything right now is they don't have 51 votes in the Senate.  The Senate is locked up and nobody can do anything because of R obstruction.

Republicans -despite their 'small government rhetoric- cause more debt [spending](https://www.propublica.org/article/national-debt-trump) & rack up [bigger deficits](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/jul/29/tweets/republican-presidents-democrats-contribute-deficit/). Obama & Clinton lowered the deficit (Clinton even managed a surplus) while all the Republicans of this era created massive deficits. The several trillions printed during Trump's tenure, the artificially low interest rates & his bungling of covid response are a direct cause of the high inflation we see now.\n\nIf Republican policies are so great, why do they [only control 30%](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2020/11/09/biden-voting-counties-equal-70-of-americas-economy-what-does-this-mean-for-the-nations-political-economic-divide/) of the US economy & [nearly 100% of the poorest areas of the country](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2014/jul/29/facebook-posts/are-97-nations-100-poorest-counties-red-states/)? When Republicans get their wet dream of policies enacted, it devastates the economy as we saw in Kansas in whats known as the [Kansas experiment.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_experiment) Wisconsin vs Minnesota is another great case study in R vs D policy over 10 years, showing Democrat policy outperforming Republicans' in [nearly every measure of quality of life](https://www.epi.org/publication/as-wisconsins-and-minnesotas-lawmakers-took-divergent-paths-so-did-their-economies-since-2010-minnesotas-economy-has-performed-far-better-for-working-families-than-wisconsin/). \n\nRepublicans have gone off the deep end. The last great Republican - Dwight Eisenhower - had policies much more in line with today's democrats. He supported strong labor laws, high minimum wage, top marginal tax rates far higher than anything dems have proposed, asylum for refugees, strong unemployment benefits, & social security for the elderly. By contrast, modern republicans have fought against all these things, including trying to repeal workers' right to a weekend. By contrast, modern radical republicans are closer to the short-lived nativist Know Nothing party of the 1800s.",

Most of us stand by you, but the minority can be very loud.  Just don't let these uninformed bigots ruin your day <3\n\nOC: Literally nobody is pushing sexuality and GRS on children.  We just want children to not be afraid if they aren't straight and want people to be who they are without having to fear how others treat them.  Nobody is forcing sexual knowledge on children, we just want kids to understand they're still normal if they're a boy that likes boys or a girl that likes girls.  Do you honestly think we're out here teaching children how to have sex?  No, we just want kids to understand that it's okay to feel the way they feel.\n\nAs far as your GRS comment, NOBODY is giving GRS to children.  The ONLY gender related care children get is therapy and sometimes hormone blockers, which are 100% safe, reversible, and also used in cis children for issues such as early puberty onset.  Teenagers can sometimes get hormones at like age 16, but this is after YEARS of therapy, blockers, and jumping through every hoop imaginable to absolutely ensure they know what they're doing.\n\nYou really should actually look into these things and research them instead of blindly assuming that people are coming to turn your kids gay and change their genitals.  Right wing media lies about anything to do with gender or sexuality to force you to think that someone is \"forcing\" sexuality and gender on kids when that does NOT happen.  If you spend 15 minutes looking at unbiased sources, you can almost immediately debunk right wing talking points about this shit.",

By contrast, modern republicans have fought against all these things, including trying to repeal workers' right to a weekend. By contrast, modern republicans have radicalized & are closer to the short-lived nativist Know Nothing party of the 1800s.\n\nIf you prefer a study that uses the term 'conservative' rather than \"right wing authoritarian,\" consider this one that concludes [\"Conservatives \\[are\\] more susceptible to believing falsehoods\"](https://news.osu.edu/conservatives-more-susceptible-to-believing-falsehoods)",

While you're probably going to argue she was \"still a kid\", she had been on testosterone blockers and estrogen for years, as well as having known she's trans her entire life.  She knew for over 10 years, her GRS was not some knee jerk reaction and it was not forced on her.\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/time.com/4350574/jazz-jennings-transgender/%3famp=true\n\nI agree that 8 year olds or 12 year olds shouldn't get GRS, but 17 year olds who have been well informed, have lived their entire life as their gender, and who always knew they were trans, should be able to if that's what they want.\n\nPeople are not getting surprise GRS or getting GRS a day after coming out.  In this case, she was extremely well informed and it was obvious that she wanted GRS and that it wasn't being forced on her.\n\nDo you not see that this is a complex issue that cannot be solved by just saying \"nobody under 18 can get any gender affirming care\"?\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.popsugar.com/celebrity/fascinating-facts-about-jazz-jennings-47309868/amp\n\n\"Though labeled as a boy at birth, Jazz identified as a girl by the age of 2 and was diagnosed with gender dysphoria by the age of 5. With her parents' approval, she started using hormone blockers when she was 11 and taking estrogen in high school, and she believes that made all the difference in her self-esteem.\n\n\"I have no regrets because it allowed me to prevent myself from going through male puberty,\" she told ABC News in October 2018. \"I feel like that's why my dysphoria hasn't been so bad is because I look in the mirror, and I see the girl that I am on the inside. But not every transgender person has the opportunity to do that.\"\"\n\nI agree that uninformed people should not get GRS, but on the other hand, it would be wrong to deny someone GRS, even if they're 17, when they have been informed and know what they want.  17 year olds are not slaves to their parents will and are capable of making decisions, believe it or not.",

Got dumped off and forgot about and spent his entire adult life addicted to heroin because doctors considered him a junky because the military didn\u2019t do shit for him when he came home so he got on opiates.   He asked if we could find him some \u2018hash that\u2019s not too strong\u2019 because he hated heroin but it was the easiest to find.\nI\u2019ll never forget Crazy Larry and how he wasn\u2019t crazy at all.  He gave everything and didn\u2019t get anything in return except for a few shit ass kids decades later finding hash for him and watching him practice calligraphy in his shitty house that was a renovated 1 car garage.\n\nI don\u2019t know why your post made me think of Larry, but I do think that \u2018scrap heap\u2019 is pulling punches when it comes to what we do to vets.",
