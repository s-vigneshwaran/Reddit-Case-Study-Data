  "text": "If you are an Atheist you should start attending Sunday services at tax-exempt Churches, so that you can be an IRS spy and make sure they aren't being political. Also look out for churches being political if you are a child that has to go (yes, even you can report them, and anonymously too).\nAs we all know, Churches have too much influence politically, yet they still remain tax-exempt. Well, news flash, tax-exempt Churches and Pastors are not allowed to directly or indirectly- endorse, contribute to, intervene in, or participate in any political campaign activity. IF THEY DO, you can report them here [https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/irs-complaint-process-tax-exempt-organizations](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/irs-complaint-process-tax-exempt-organizations) This will have a chance to take away their tax-exempt status and could help our cause a lot",

                              "text": "We started out members of a little known denomination called Open Bible. Later the senior pastor concluded the church was big enough it could sustain itself without the protections of the denomination, and he would be able to dramatically increase his own salary if the church no longer sent the standard 10% tithe up the chain. We separated, and became an officially non-denominational church; while maintaining the same overall philosophy.\n\nI'm summarizing. Before we could leave the denomination, the church had to hold a vote. Of course most of us knew very little about what it meant to be part of a denomination, and what it would mean to be separate from one. The senior staff assured us nothing would change, except the church would be more free to steer its own destiny. In hindsight, I'm sure it must have been obvious to some. \n\nRegardless most people voted the way the senior pastor did. Maybe 200 of us stayed after service to vote. 200 of the pastor's most loyal followers. Those of us most involved in church affairs. People who trusted his advice, and wisdom almost implicitly. It's not like healthy distrust of authority is a tenent of the Christian faith.\n\nWithin a few short years we transitioned from being a small community church to an amphitheater church. The senior leadership all bought giant tracks of land upon which they built palatial homes. All the while the church bulletin would solicit free labor from the congregation to dig drainage, or build fences on their land.\n\nI'd like to say this was one of the main drivers to me ultimately questioning my faith, but prosperity doctrine is insidious. It's only in hindsight that I realized what they were doing was wrong.",

Gender dysphoria isn't the only condition they suffer from typically and all need to be treated as a mental illness. \n\nAside from the extremely rare cases of children with gender dysphoria, I believe there exists a social contagion of children and parents who want to be special for the sake of being special. Social media access and consumption is definitely influencing parents to push (probably subconsciously, but possibly consciously) their children into being confused about their gender. But older children definitely want to fit in with the special crowd where they are given more attention. It's no secret that generation Z is the generation with the largest LGBT+ aligning population. \n\nThat's my beliefs and a large number of people in the US believe similarly. I know many of them are conservatives, but there are many people like me who don't fit into a political label too.\n\nI also want to point out that everything I typed is not hateful in any way. But reddit admins believe it is. Reddit mods believe it is. That's the sad reality of this movement. If I don't accept faulty science, I'm a bigot.",

I myself am transgender and nonbinary, meaning I am not a man nor a woman, just a person, and my pronouns are they/them. My sex is my personal medical information that I am not required to share with anyone other than my health care professionals.\n\nFirstly, being transgender (or trans) means one feels a persistent disconnect with their internal sense of self (gender identity) and their sex. One's sex generally corresponds to their assigned gender at birth, or AGAB, with the exception of many intersex people. This sense of incongruity is called gender dysphoria and generally begins in childhood. Gender identity typically develops in stages:\n\n- **Around age two**:\u00a0Children become conscious of the physical differences between boys and girls.\n- **Before their third birthday**:\u00a0Most children can easily label themselves as either a boy or a girl.\n- **By age four**:\u00a0Most children have a stable sense of their gender identity ([Source.](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/gradeschool/Pages/Gender-Identity-and-Gender-Confusion-In-Children.aspx#:~:text=Gender%20identity%20typically%20develops%20in,sense%20of%20their%20gender%20identity.)).\n\nFeelings of gender dysphoria generally become more poignant during puberty when differences between the sexes develop and gender stereotypes become more rigid. It also [does not go away](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gender-dysphoria/in-depth/pubertal-blockers/art-20459075).\n\nWhen people say trans women are women or trans men are men, they mean that although they were born/assigned either male or female at birth, their internal sense of self is dictated by the individual themselves. They are discussing their gender (man/woman/nonbinary), *not* their biological sex (male/female/intersex), when making these statements. There are cis and trans women that look masculine or have lower voices, but that does not mean they are not women. There are cis and trans men that are feminine or that have breasts (including from gynecomastia, many of whom get them removed), but that does not mean they are not men. When you say that you don't believe trans people are the gender they say they are, you are saying you know their mind and their lived experience better than they do.\n\nSecondly, one does not \"become transgender,\" rather they realize they are transgender and sometimes take steps to transition. There is social transitioning, including clothing, name, and pronoun changes, and medical transitioning, including puberty blockers, hormone replacement therapy (hrt), and gender reassignment surgeries which include removal of the breasts (top surgery), vaginoplasty and phalloplasty (bottom surgery). I will say right now that top surgery is **not done** on people under 16, and bottom surgery is **not done** on anyone under the age of 18 and no one is trying to change that.\n\nThere is no medical intervention for pre-pubescent children, as there is no hormonal difference between the sexes. Before medical transition can occur, children need to be diagnosed with gender dysphoria by a medical professional to establish that gender-affirming care would improve their quality of life. This is not a mental illness, but rather a name for a treatable discomfort and distress with one's body due to their gender not aligning with their body's sex. Puberty blockers delay the onset of puberty and allow the child up to two additional years to come to terms with their gender identity and decide what they want to do. The effects of puberty blockers are reversible once the medication is stopped. These medications have been used for decades to treat early-onset puberty in cisgender children.\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy can be a good tool for reducing the symptoms of anxiety and depression, which can appear as a result of gender dysphoria.  However it does not treat the root cause of gender dysphoria, so symptoms persist. Gender-affirming care has been ***clinically proven*** by dozens of studies over the last decade to improve mental health outcomes. A study of trans and gender-diverse teens and young adults published in 2022 \"found that those who had access to puberty blockers or gender-affirming hormones were\u00a060 percent less likely\u00a0to experience moderate to severe depression. And those with access to the medical treatments were 73 percent less likely to contemplate self-harm or suicide\" ([Source](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-the-science-on-gender-affirming-care-for-transgender-kids-really-shows/)).\n\nFinally, no one comes out as trans for attention. All most LGBTQ+ people want is to live their lives and be left alone. With the amount of bullying and harassment my community faces, we actively work to prevent child suicide through organizations like The Trevor Project because we *have seen and lived through* the hate that they face. That \"special attention\" you mention includes verbal and emotional abuse, interpersonal and institutional discrimination, and physical and sexual violence.\n\nAs someone else already said, there are more LGBTQ+ identifying individuals in younger generations because society is more accepting and there are more protections for us now. Many older members of the LGBTQ+ community describe people being attacked, arrested, and killed regularly for 'sexual deviancy' and nonconformity to gender norms.\n\nStill, there is a disproportionate danger for LGBTQ+ individuals even in America today. From a [2020 FBI report](https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-releases-2020-hate-crime-statistics), 17% of hate crimes committed in 2020 were because of a person's perceived sexual or gender identity (additional [source](https://www.glaad.org/reference/hate-crime) ). There are still LGBTQ+ panic defenses used in court to argue that a person's sexual or gender identity is to blame for the defendant's violent reaction, including murder. As recently as 2018, this defense was used to [mitigate a murder charge](https://lgbtqbar.org/programs/advocacy/gay-trans-panic-defense/). Only 16 states and D.C. have legislatively banned the use of this defense, all but three of those in the last 3 years.\n\n\nWith all this in mind, please remember that behind all of the rhetoric in society right now, there are individual adults and children who just want to be happy and comfortable in their bodies. A person's medical decisions should be between themselves, their family if they are a minor, and their healthcare professional. Since someone picking up their prescribed medication at a pharmacy is not affecting those around them, I see no reason for people to demand they stop.",

My point is that if trans people say something is transphobic, it means you should understand that if you are not trans, you may not have the full picture on how it can be harmful. And you need to realize, that what you are saying IS harmful!\n\nI have to go now, so I'm leaving you with these:\n\nhttps://www.hrc.org/resources/the-lies-and-dangers-of-reparative-therapy\n\nhttps://www.apa.org/topics/lgbtq/transgender",

During the late 1970s, the term\u00a0conversion therapy\u00a0began to be used for the process of attempting to turn gay people straight. Its synonym,\u00a0reparative therapy\u00a0came a bit later, in the 1990s. At this time, it was used exclusively to refer to attempts to change the sexual orientation of gay and lesbian people. Starting in the mid- to late 2000s, both transgender and bisexual people began to receive more recognition, and so the term became associated with them too.\n\n>Reparative therapy\u00a0and\u00a0conversion therapy\u00a0have both been used. However, there appears to be greater interest in\u00a0conversion therapy\u00a0in recent years. Two major incidents may have sparked this. __In 2014, a transgender teen, Leelah Alcorn committed suicide, explicitly citing\u00a0conversion therapy\u00a0as a motivating factor.__ The circumstances behind her suicide caused outrage across the country, which then-President Obama addressed.\u00a0Conversion therapy\u00a0was also linked to Vice President Mike Pence during the 2016 election, as he was accused of funding its continuation with federal dollars.\n\nhttps://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/conversion-therapy/\n\n\n>__Conversion therapy (or \u2018cure\u2019 therapy or reparative therapy) refers to any form of treatment or psychotherapy which aims to change a person\u2019s sexual orientation or to suppress a person\u2019s gender identity.__ It is based on an assumption that being lesbian, gay, bi or trans is a mental illness that can be \u2018cured\u2019. These therapies are both unethical and harmful.\n\n>__In the UK, all major counselling and psychotherapy bodies, as well as the NHS, have concluded that conversion therapy is dangerous and have condemned it by signing a\u00a0Memorandum of Understanding (PDF). We are working to make sure that this covers gender identity too.__\u00a0\u00a0\n\nhttps://www.stonewall.org.uk/campaign-groups/conversion-therapy\n\n\n\nConversion therapy on kids has been outlawed in Germany because it is TORTURE and it obviously doesn't work.

This typically involved showing patients pictures of naked men while giving them electric shocks or drugs to make them vomit, and, once they could no longer bear it, showing them pictures of naked women or sending them out on a \"date\" with a young nurse. Needless to say, these cruel and degrading methods proved entirely ineffective.!<\n\n>First published in 1968, DSM-II (the second edition of the American classiifcation of mental disorders) listed homosexuality as a mental disorder. ...\n\n>...Not until 1987 did homosexuality completely fall out of the DSM.\n\n>Meanwhile, the World Health Organization (WHO) only removed homosexuality from its ICD classification with the publication of ICD-10 in 1992...\n\nhttps://www.google.de/amp/s/www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/hide-and-seek/201509/when-homosexuality-stopped-being-mental-disorder%3famp?espv=1\n\nI'm done with this argument.

It was so successful it is still working to this very day. \n\n\"Constantine saw with his own eyes the trophy of a cross of light in the heavens, above the sun, and bearing this inscription: conquer by this. At the sight, he himself was struck with amazement and his whole army also.\u201d\n\nPeople who wear a cross literally are wearing the symbol of the new (well it was new in like the year 350) holy Roman empire.

There was probably indirect influence, but there is no evidence that he was that involved. Early church fathers like Iraneus and Origen for example are clearly influencial in Nicene creed.\n\nIndeed, the church doctrine was autonomical enough to oppose imperial authority from early on. Ambrose of Milan is an early example. Surely Constantine would have made the church clearly a subject of the emperor, if he had had a very direct influence on the Nicean council.",

He was literally charged with treason\u2026 He was sentenced to death at birth for treason against King Herod, causing his parents to flee to Bethlehem, then he illegally immigrated back to Judea at the fringe of the empire, where he was charged with treason for claiming to be the King of the Jews, an inscription Pilate had placed above his head at crucifixion and above his tomb according to mythology. Your narrative is what? Roman Empire extra-judisciously killed a guy for blasphemy because the Sanhedrin asked them to nicely? That just simply isn\u2019t the case in the Bible, and historically the only thing we know for certain is that Pilate was a real person who was a prefect under Tiberius.\n\n\nAs for the last bit, mythologically earth is seen as the domain of Satan. That\u2019s why Satan is able to offer Jesus the Kingdom when tempting him in the desert. The exchange about the taxes starts with Jesus asking whose face is on the coin, they say Cesar, and he says \u201cThen it is Cesar\u2019s\u201d The mythological counterpoint here being that \u201chumans are made in God\u2019s image\u201d thus, bearing his image in the same way the coins bear the image of Cesar, and like taxes, ought to be used for the improvement of God\u2019s Kingdom, whatever that means to the reader mythologically. But to read this message through the text, this isn\u2019t a platonic division between earth and heaven, this is very real and political work that ought to echo the emancipation of the Hebrews from Egypt, so it ought to focus on social justice, governmental power dynamics, and neighborliness. So this isn\u2019t just a split between church and state, this, it\u2019s a allegory that\u2019s says \u201cin the same way money goes to work for the Roman Empire, to build aqueducts, roads, cities, etc.\u201d those who bear God\u2019s image ought to go to work for a Godly kingdom. \n\nIt\u2019s impossible to do things like securing food for the needy, housing, healthcare, and other things that make human life viable without actually getting politically involved. Handing out sandwiches doesn\u2019t solve the systemic issue of hunger/poverty. The work the grand mythology of the Bible calls for is a deeply political work and anyone who says Christians are prohibited from getting involved in politics mistakes the modern practice for the mythology. I get that the Western Christian church is all we really have in regards to Christianity, but their own mythology is drastically divergent from their narrative, and there\u2019s plenty of space for coalitions that aren\u2019t abhorrent. The Modern Christian Church in the West is an extension of the Republican Party, and has been since Nixon. The marriage is wrong from both sides of the aisle (the Christian and Governmental side) for varying reasons, but that doesn\u2019t mean Christians are mythologically prohibited from being involved in local politics. It\u2019s actually the opposite.",

I\u2019m not saying handing out sandwiches is bad. I\u2019m saying it doesn\u2019t solve the issue on a societal level.\n\nI\u2019m not suggesting Republican Christians do much of anything except fuck entirely off. I\u2019m merely pointing out that in the Bible, God frees slaves and sets up literally an entire government and eventually nation of people. To call this apolitical is laughable. The entire mythology is drenched in politics, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s drenched in US Republican politics. \n\nThe problems society and the US have require people with different goals to collaborate when their goals align. Whether it\u2019s through meeting immediate needs like food or clothing, or through systemically addressing issues via political movements, it\u2019s lazy to go \u201cChristian=Bad\u201d when there are Christian sects out there that are radically opposed to even moderately conservative politics.\n\nChristian, Agnostic, Anarchist, Bhuddist, doesn\u2019t matter when we\u2019re all coming together on something to make the world a better place. If you disagree with the methodology then that\u2019s fine, I\u2019m not here to debate that, but just wanting the Bible to be this big easy boogieman to take down with straw men doesn\u2019t make it that. It\u2019s a lot more complex and complicated, and to your point originally, not even just related to the IRS classifications, but if people really cared about their \u201cproclaimed faith\u201d they\u2019d be the first ones doing shit about the \u201cbad apples\u201d in their bunch. But they (meaning Western US Christians) don\u2019t do anything because the whole thing is a patriotic LARP for them.\n\nBut also respectfully, please don\u2019t say made up premises from the Bible and then be like \u201cOh who cares what the Bible has to say\u201d. Clearly you care enough to tell other people what you think it says, and I care enough to provide other perspective.",

Ancap has hunger as a \"distribution of goods\" market anomaly (and NOT \"lack of capital\" for purchasing), and it might be argued that states imposing \"national interests\" have used guns to prevent the free flow of goods in a *truly free* market.  If it wasn't for the guns and the squabbles of men, we wouldn't need \"UN Peacekeepers\" to send food to Afghanistan (enduring a horrible famine, thanks Taliban), and it's not rocket surgery, I could send a Door Dash but *it wouldn't get there because of wannabe statists*.\n\nSo yes, in my local town I have bought food for random people, there's a soup kitchen as we get a lot of \"displaced\" people, yet in practical terms I spend most of my time negotiating squabbles between the Oracle and the Architect, two would be opposites who enjoy their jobs, on behalf of \"humanity's interests\" in my divine reflection, and \"post-statism\" is a theory that bears many interesting children.\n\n> To call this apolitical is laughable.\n\nFair, and maybe what men think a \"nation\" is is a bit skewed by their sins from what the code actually defines.\n\n> The problems society and the US have require\n\nI am \"an anarchist\" as derived from first principles and accepting the evidences in the collapsed wave function - \"king\" presupposes \"rank\" and \"force\", whereas \"leader\" only implies a future I choose - and I usually say \"rational anarchist\" meaning I can explain it to anyone honest.  In *rational* terms, lol, it would be unwise to dismantle the state(s) any time soon - I like Milley and Garlard where I Got 'em - but it is wise to impose, via the apparatus (singular, the law as written) of the state, a recalibration of \"representitive\", \"justice\", and \"executive officer\" that FIRMLY prohibits \"kings\" and hopefully embraces leaders.\n\nThis is to say: what men say|think|do about religion has almost no economic relationship to actual sandwiches in hands, unless it's an actual sandwich, and this is true whether or not a \"state\" (\"cops and soldiers\") get involved, and when they get involved history shows they sinned in gluttony at the expense of not just foreigners but their own people, and MORE people went hungry.  Despite a few successes including Biden doing about as well as one can considering the various wavefunctions, hunger is best solved locally, criminals are best caught early, wars are always bloody, and by now all the aid workers say the problem isn't lack of money or charity, it's politics.\n\nPete Buttigieg is a homosexual legally married with adopted kids... see me clutching my pearls?  Cz I am, seriously.  I got yer pearls riiight here.  He is also a great SecTrans by any standard and has worked insane hours for more than a year now.  As rational an anarchism as the world can afford is good enough for tomorrow, for me.\n\n> It\u2019s a lot more complex and complicated\n\nIt is!  It's a masterpiece of divine comedy, Leela, Samsara, and merely the shadow on the wall of my 7th dimension, it is ONE story, in ONE squared infinity of stories about just one form of intelligence on your planet... and it *is* the only book titled \"the book\".  I also know who wrote it and *why*, who can edit it and why and *how*, and for my promise to \"try not to f\\*\\*\\* it up too much\" I have found a way to \"save everyone\" who \"obeys the Spirit\" (whether they obey any man), and will reward those with whom I am pleased in both Spirit and worldly things, for I AM made in His \"what love actually *implies*\" image, and that'sa how teh game is rigged, pal.  One side always wins, there is only one side, and the rest is people figuring it out or preferring the lie and that's not the side that wins.\n\nIt wasn't the election that was rigged, it isn't about the nation nor the kingdom - no offense intended - in my humble opinion and honest statement, based on what I think is your/our/my best interests.\n\nMay your summer be warm *but not too hot*. :)",

Not much of that going on here in New England anyway, where most people don't even go to church, many have closed, and the ones there are often function as the religious/social space for an immigrant group or are liberal do-gooders. Since Covid started one of the nearby churches developed a massive weekly food give away that attracts a huge line of people on Saturday mornings. Every time I walk by during the week they're unloading huge deliveries of different kinds of foodstuffs. You can tell it's a major effort and I'm assuming no one is getting paid, so you have to respect it. They're too busy for politics.

Go look at it and say it is totally fair that any group of atheists should have a religious person monitoring it in case they plan on breaking the law.\n\nI swear i am always astounded by some people.\n\nI do not believe in a god. Any god. I doubt their is anything at death besides cessation of life \n\nThats it. I do not have faith and i do not share a belief with people that follow religon.  \n\nI do however believe these people have a right to think and feel whatever they want. There are laws i feel should be more enforced. I hope that you are smart enough to realise that if you endorse them being monitored,byou endorse you and i being monitored...\n\nMaybe this is because i come from Catholic ireland and lived there during the troubles.

Ive noticed that while Ave Maria advertises itself as a catholic university, the names of the conservative heavyweights in its heavily marketed \"distinguished speakers\" series show a clear and obvious bias towards Republican ideas. \n\nI would urge caution about being critical of Ave Maria. The last person i knew of that went and complained about how undemocratic things were in Ave Maria was Steven Narcisso who worked in real estate and loved the idea of a catholic community....until he was excommunicated for speaking his mind about how the Ave Maria Grammar and Prep School sold out to a donor. Now its know as the Donahue Academy. While its obvious that Ave Maria is biased and benefits greatly from its tax exempt status, one can complain to the IRS but the legal language in the religious tax exempt section of the tax code is very broad and allows for a lot of leeway in allowing crooked churches while seemingly being compliant with the law in reality many churches and schools violate the spirit the law intended.",

Probably be best if you came and spied on us for about six months or so, just to make sure.\n\nBE WARNED: if you come back more than four times, you might get asked if you'd like to provide some snacks for Fellowship Hour yourself...\n\nEDIT: Oh, I almost forgot. They'll be \"nice\" to you, but they won't get all up in your face. They're German, and they don't like that overly emotional pushy stuff. I'm frankly surprised they've put up with me for 12 years.",

They sometimes get frustrated when I don't preach politics. The Democrats get pretty excited when I start calling for the church to support the poor (an often Democratic plank). They then start to squirm a bit when I say that means that WE, as a local congregation, should support our Food Pantry with more than just money - that we should actually feed the hungry.\n\nThe Republicans like it when I mention that the Bible teaches that charity isn't a government's job... but they get ***really*** squirmy when I tell them that the Bible is clear that it's OUR job to look after orphans and widows in their distress, that it's OUR job to provide jobs for the poor so they can feed themselves.\n\nBoth issues are \"seen\" as political... but both are simply expressions of what's ACTUALLY in the Text. Sadly, not very many people who claim Christianity are that interested in emulating the life of Jesus on a regular basis.\n\nSo, there you go. Service is at 11am on Sundays.",
