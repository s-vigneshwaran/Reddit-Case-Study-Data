  "text": "TIFU by telling a woman at our first date that her pepper spray is useless.\nSo this actually happened today. A few hours ago.\n\nSo a friend set me up with this woman because she thought we have similar hobbies and a similar dark humor. We met today the first time for a coffee/tea. We were actually having a good time, or at least I thought so. We clicked right away and had a lot to talk and laugh about.\n\nAfter like an hour she suggested to pay our drinks and go somewhere else for launch and I happily agreed. As we were about to pay our drinks she started searching her purse for her wallet and put various objects on the counter because she seemed like to have a bit of a mess in her purse. One of these objects was a pepper spray. I casually mentioned after leaving the coffee \"Id consider getting a different pepper spray if you plan to defend yourself. This one is quite useless.\"\n\n*For a bit of context: I used to test various of pepper sprays and tear gas in the military. We were stupid and young but it was also kind of thrilling. And the product she had was by far the worst/weakest we tested. I just recognized the bottle because it was so bad and thought I should let her know that this is probably not the best option to go with. But she obviously didnt know about that because, well, we just met an hour ago.*\n\nAfter this comment our conversation kind of died and she suddenly had a work emergency and had to go. I took me a few minutes until I realized that my comment was beyond creepy without any context. I am definitely not used to meet new people. I hope Ive not traumatized her.\n\nTLDR: Creeped out a woman Ive only met an hour before by telling her her pepper spray would be not very effective if she intended to defend herself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Its all good. She called me, she apologized for running off, I apologized for my weird comment and we are going out again. Yey. Ill try to not do any weird comments about her precautions again.\n\nEdit2: Thanks for blowing this up. She found the post and now we are sending each other screenshots of weird/funny comments. Thanks for the entertainment.\n\nEdit3: I am not an expert for defense spray. We were just some bored soldiers with some examples. And this one was outstanding mild/bad, that is why I have recognized it. So dont ask me for pepper spray advice.",

You have ninety degrees of angle both vertically and horizonallty you can safely shoot, as opposed to the average range which probably has five degrees of angle to shoot in.",

I did not get attacked, and was na\u00efvely disappointed that I didn\u2019t get to try the BACK OFF.\n\nI remember the man saying that it was the good stuff, for dogs.

While yes, hollow points are just better for law enforcement for the very reason you mentioned, they also wound the target a lot more than a bullet just passing through. For military conflicts that has quite a few advantages because a badly wounded enemy soldier is a lot more valuable than a dead one. They need to get him off the battlefield and treat his wounds which requires multiple people for each wounded soldier. In military conflicts they don't care about not shooting the guy behind the target but about downing the target and occuping multiple enemy soldiers with saving the wounded.",

That's where M855 in .556 and M80/M62 in 7.62x51mm come in. These rounds are illegal for a citizen to possess. Thus it's more important for law enforcement to have their rounds break apart when striking anything but their target, and their targets are rarely if ever wearing armor. I don't think law enforcement is really after inflicting as much flesh damage as possible when selecting their rounds.",

In fact, if you search round testing, those that break apart regularly are rated extremely low because of it. You want a round to stay together, but expand as much as possible.\n\nNow as far as armor. Armor is rated for any bullet type up to the caliber it's intended for. The less it expands, the more likely it is to defeat the armor. 3A is intended for handgun calibers. Throw a FMJ 193 at it and it'll go right through. Class IV armor is rated for rifle rounds.",

Way way way way more than regular bullets do.\n  \nWith regular bullets there's a good chance it'll pass through the target's body and hit someone standing behind them.\n  \nHollow points are designed to ***NOT*** do that, so that they're much much much less dangerous to shoot when there's a crowd of people behind the target. Because 99% of the time they stay in the target's body and don't blow out of their back. That's what they're designed to do.\n  \nBoy, you've been watching too many bad and cheesy cop movies. It's a common trope to claim in a movie that hollow points are somehow super dangerous. When the entire reason for their existence is that they'd much much much safer for law enforcement to use. Because if someone is behind the target, you can't shoot them with a regular bullet, cos of the danger of hitting the person behind. That's why hollow points were invented, so that they'd be much safer. And they are.\n  \nOf course there's still sometimes accidents because law enforcement in the US are fucking untrained morons. There's too many examples of them shooting at a far away target when there's people behind, and because their accuracy is trash because they only had 6 months of training before becoming a cop, they miss the target and hit people behind\n  \nBut that's got nothing to do with whether hollow points are safer or not. The fact is, they are much safer. Cops in the US are dangerous regardless of what they use because they're all either sociopaths or sociopath-enablers.\n  \nStop watching stuff like the Bad Boys movies and thinking they're real life.",

For larger animals, ideally the bullet will not exit, meaning it has done the max amount of damage possible (as in, given the same energy, a bullet that can mushroom more while still staying intact is better. This is measured by diameter and remaining weight after picking the bullet out of ballistic gel or a carcass). \n\nIf you use FMJ you get neither pelt nor meat, just a few drops of blood and a ruined trip. The difference between a 7.62mm diameter hole in a lung and a 20+ mm diameter hole is huge.\nNow, how about arrows then? Well, training arrow tips have a point, while hunting arrow tips have a flat cutting edge, making a much larger hole. So same idea, really.\nI use TSX, which is a hollow point all copper bullet (lead free, to avoid contaminating the meat). Really impressive stuff. Unfortunately they seem to have stopped making the middle weight in my caliber, and my gun doesn't really \"like\" the heaviest, while the lightest weight bullet really is too light for what I wanted to hunt post covid-19. 20? 21? 22? Has it really been that long?",

Most european police forces are allowed to aim for knees or arms if the situation permits it. \nThis still falls under lethal force but it\u2019s up to the officer if he deems a direct kill shot necessary vs. trying to wound the suspect.\n\nSame for warning shots, perfectly legal for a police officer.\n\nYes I know there\u2019s a 90% chance you\u2019ll think it\u2019s dumb or whatever but we don\u2019t have cops getting shot by the dozens thanks to them aiming for a leg, we do have suspects surviving thanks to these tactics, and nobody dies from bullets from the sky as warning shots have to be aimed at the ground. (No, not from richocheting bullets either)\n\nIf the above doesn\u2019t apply to you then sorry, I\u2019m just tired of people acting like the USA rules are worldwide and everyone doing something different is a complete moron.",

If you spray it at a person they're going to be a lot closer to you. There have been a couple articles about it because people started bringing it to protests in the United States last year and causing pretty bad injuries. It's a highly pressurized noxious aerosol. It isn't meant to be shot directly at anybody (including bears).",

A stun gun isn't designed to do either of those things; it causes pain and a very small area of neuromuscular incapacitation (the muscle it is used on will seize; a hand will grip hard or release, a bicep will draw that arm up, the stomach will probably bend them forward, a thigh will draw that leg up and away or maybe tip them over).\n\nWhen trained to use a Taser police over here are very specifically told that the drive stun mode - using it as a contact stun gun, rather than probe deployment at range - has very limited usage and will as likely make an attacker more aggressive than it will subdue them. It's very painful and could be used as a push tool, as people instinctively try and get away from a source of pain, but anyone aggressive it is used on will just as likely instinctively grab or punch you instead.\n\nI've had both, and I'd never carry a contact stun device over a good PAVA spray.",

If you come out with unsolicited advice about locks, you sound pretentious. But if I tell a story about why I have a lockpicking hobby (used to work with guys that did it; I even use the story of how they handcuffed me behind my back right before lunch my first day there and would put locks on my desk drawers) , they're more receptive.\n\nPeople aren't in your head. They don't know where your advice is coming from.",

              "text": "Tell her in a text. Just be like \"hey I realized after you left that without context my comment about your pepper spray might have come off as creepy or odd, sorry about that. In the past I was assigned by the military to actually test various brands of pepper spray and report how effective they were... it wasn't my favorite job. I remembered the brand you pulled out of your purse because it was the weakest one I tried. I had a good time on our date, but I understand if my comment made you uncomfortable and you aren't interested in seeing me again. I just wanted to clarify why I made the comment about your pepper spray because safety is important and if you were to use the one you have in an emergency, well I worry it wouldn't have the effect you'd need it to.\"\n\nShe'll likely message your friend and ask \"hey did OP really have a job testing pepper spray?\" if your friend can confirm with something like \"Yeah. And I thought my job sucked, lmfao\" you probably have a decent chance (well if she enjoyed the date other than that comment you made).\n\nEdit to add: My mom got pepper spray from the police station when she got a restraining order. That shit was the worst. I once played with it as a young teen (like 13 or 14) because I was curious if it actually smelled like pepper (it does!) I sprayed a small amount on my finger and took a whiff. First off just smelling it (my finger did not touch my nose) the smell alone made the inside of my nose burn pretty bad. After I thoroughly washed my hands (I scrubbed with soap for like 5 mins) before taking a shower. I got out of the shower and as I was drying off I rubbed my eye for some reason. Holy shit the burning, I thought I must have permanently fucked up my eye for how much it hurt. And that was just from the faint residue left on my hand after washing my hands and showering! I can't even imagine getting hit full in the face with that shit, shit is brutal. Your job sucked.\n\nI've never tested other brands but I did once spray wasp killing spray in my eye (I was trying to kill a wasp nest but accidentally aimed the bottle the wrong way). That small amount of pepper spray residue I got in my eyes hurt way worse than a direct hit from the wasp killer.\n\nThe spray itself looked [like this](https://www.amazon.com/Mace-PepperGard-Personal-Strength-Detection/dp/B07VWB96C4), but I can't say for sure it's the same brand (it's been 10 years). My mom got it from an actual police station though, so maybe it was stronger than stuff you can buy online? Like \"police grade\" vs. \"civilian grade\"? Idk. Also, it didn't fire in \"bursts\" as some say they do. It fired out a thin powerful stream (I'd say it could easily hit someone 10-12 feet away in windless conditions), and if you held down the trigger it kept spraying with force until the cannister ran empty. Theoretically, you could just hold down the trigger continuously and empty the entire cannister in your assailant's eyes.",

There's a dip at 5000 Hz, so songs with like whistling or high pitched vocals might sound off?\n\nI'm noticing user reviews on the sound are lower than site reviews, which - users TBH have more experience.

But that matters a lot to some people and not at all to others.\n\nNow would be a really good idea to buy some Sennheisers. I'm hesitant to recommend them in the future, because they just got bought by a holding company, but for now they're still quality. It sounds like you want something comfortable, and they're super comfortable.

Excellent headphones. Not a lot to say about them really, worth every penny. \n\n- Audio-Technica ATH-M50 - $150, generally highly recommended, solid value for the price, the go-to close backs for anyone who enjoys boomy bass as opposed to the flatter/neutral curve typical of studio headphones\n\n- Beyerdynamic DT-770 Pros - $160, my personal favorite of the 3 in terms of comfort & sound. Be mindful of model details if/when ordering - the 32 ohm & in most cases the 80 ohm models can be used without an amp plugged directly into a source, the 250ohm version really needs to be amped tho. \n\n\n-------\n\nMy personal favorites (currently)\n\nMeze 99 classics - $309, little pricier but worth every penny, insanely good build quality and the most comfortable headphones I've even owned. The sound rivals some highly regarded open backs imo... I've used them pretty much exclusively since getting them & would be my choice if I could only have 1 pair of headphones hands down.",

Shit half my friends called me the R word for buying another jeep. But they at least expressed their opinions.\n\nShe honestly couldn't know the spray she got is ineffective. Letting her know what she bought isn't criticism of *her*. It's criticism of a product. The fact that she had it says she's concerned about her safety. With context, she probably would have appreciated knowing that there's better products on the market.\n\nPersonally, if I were OP, I'd buy the better product (Pepper spray isn't that expensive) and ask the friend to give it to her but include a hand written note explaining that they didn't mean to be creepy, they tested Pepper sprays and gasses in the military and the product they were sending to her was incredibly effective. State you had a good time and you'd love to see her again, but leave it so she could arrange the time and place.",

You need to be pretty close to the person to use it, I think the max range is 10 feet. Whereas bear spray has more volume and more propellant (that's why the caniser is bigger). It can shoot like 30 feet away and for a longer period of time, the idea being to stop the bear from coming any closer. If you have to wait until the bear is within a couple feet of you to spray it, you'll just piss it off and it could attack you. Also, using more concentrated spray is cruel. If you read the instructions that come with bear spray, it's more of a deterrent to get them to avoid you, it's not designed to seriously injure the bear, which a more concentrated spray might. Bottom line is, what you really want out of bear spray is distance/propellant, which you don't get from people spray.",

I told her that she needs a gun or something because pepper spray won't do jack shit to someone who is seriously trying to harm her. She called my bluff and handed it to me. I thought I was going to prove her wrong and sprayed myself right in the face.... Boy was I fucking wrong.\n\nThat was one of the most agonizing hours of my life. First instinct was to rub eyes, that made it works. Second was to pour water on my face, that just spread it around. So then I poured a bowl of milk and just put my face in it. I stayed there for a good 20 minutes.\n\nNeedless to say, I went out and bought my mom, and sister a little thing of pepper spray.",

I know it\u2019s not for everybody and some people are even scared of it so I hope my personal experiences can help alleviate some of that. \n\nTo your question; it depends on a lot of factors for me personally. I do know people who treat it like you would a cell phone. A good holster makes it easier. I won\u2019t say you can forget it\u2019s there or something because at the end of the day it is a bulky hunk of metal/plastic pressing into you and you do notice it. I go AIWB (appendix, inside waistband) which is essentially 12-1 o\u2019clock. They make holsters for my gun (Glock 19) that allow you to carry an extra mag but I don\u2019t have one. It already holds 15+1. An extra mag would be another 15/17 plus the bulk and weight that comes along with it. I don\u2019t mind the bulk. I edc a normal folding knife, a mini flashlight, and there\u2019s a Swiss Army knife on my keys so there\u2019s already a lot of bulk lol. I guess I have just gotten used to it over time. \n\nHope that helps answer some questions. Feel free to ask more, I don\u2019t mind. Shooting is a big hobby of mine and I enjoy trying to help inform more people/remove some fear or stigma surrounding it.",

In other words, they preemptively attempt to appease the abuser by agreeing, answering what they know the parent wants to hear, or by ignoring their personal feelings and desires and do anything and everything to prevent the abuse.*\n\nIt\u2019s a fear response to run, freeze etc but now there\u2019s this one too.

You have to know how to use a stun-gun and that particular stun-gun too, they're a very vast family of things that range from Radio Shack homebrew specials to multi-shot dart-throwers and everything in between including elaborately concealed devices.  Does it have prongs to pierce clothing?  Will it only work reliably on bare skin?  Does it incapacitate or only induce pain?  It's not useless if it only induces pain but if you apply it expecting one thing and get another this can spell the end of your advantage.  With sprays this means sacrificing a can or two to see how it comes out, how far it can reach and what angle you have to hold it at for a given distance.  (While you're at it, pick up a disposable painter's suit from the hardware store for everyone participating in this little exercise!)  \n\nKnowing how to use a weapon rightly is critical, I've seen film of a girl, pick up an unfamiliar rifle (she knew how to shoot in general) and proceed to begin to disassemble it instead of making it ready to fire, so just *having* a potent weapon does precisely diddley-shit if you don't know how to apply it.  Like, that's the real meaning behind the flashy martial arts board-breaking business, it shows you that you can make a strong strike with just your hands and feet, which everybody has, but you've got to know how to do it.  And there's a difference between breaking a piece of dimensional lumber and those charlatans who make demonstrations with specially prepared things like blocks of ice or concrete blocks, anyone who knows even a little about materials science knows how those things can seem very strong but be broken with surprisingly little force under the correct conditions -which somehow always end up existing at those demonstrations.",

Also the number of women that keep them long after expiration is disappointing.  I used to tell people,  but it's just not worth it.  It seems that's one place where you can't try to keep someone safe without being a creep. I'm pretty sure recommending spray to someone is taken worse than recommending someone get training and buy a pistol.",

We chatted about hobbies/interests, he started offering me rides home (I know, I\u2019m stupid), and we ended up going to see a Japanese movie called Midnight Eagle (2007) together. A theme that I enjoyed was the main character\u2019s ability to take vivid photographs of the night sky, and it turned out my classmate also liked photography, but I unfortunately forgot this exchange pretty quickly. \n\nA couple weeks later he announced that he had a \u201csurprise\u201d for me while he was driving me home at 10pm. He pulled over by a lake, had me get out while still refusing to tell me what the \u201csurprise\u201d was. He led me to a dark/secluded area in silence. I was super freaked out, realizing I didn\u2019t know much about him, I hadn\u2019t told my parents about him the entire semester so they didn\u2019t know who I was with, none of my classmates were aware he was giving me rides either so thought I was going to be raped or killed and no one ever would know. \n\nThen he pulls out some camera equipment that I\u2019d totally missed seeing him grab from the backseat, and he tells me the surprise is that he\u2019s going to teach me how to take night photos. Needless to say, I didn\u2019t remember any of the tips he gave me that night with my adrenaline pumping. I unfortunately never quite trusted him again over my misunderstanding his actions that were honestly super thoughtful. It\u2019s been over a decade and I still cringe at the memory.",

          "text": "Absolutely not. Women live in a world where they are surrounded by people who are physically larger and stronger than they are; people who could potentially hurt, kill or rape them if angered. Most women grow up and have to deal with sexually aggressive men as they mature. I have never been raped; but have  had a variety of non-consensual sexual encounters in the form of being groped and/or flashed from an early age. \n\nThe first time I ever saw an erect adult male penis, I was playing frisbee in the street with my friends on a hot summer day. A car came by and the guy driving rolled down his window and asked for directions. Turns out all he really wanted was to touch himself and display himself to me. I was shocked and screamed. He drove off. I was eleven years old. \n\nThat same year, I started going to school in a different part of the city and had to take the subway to get there. Spent that year regularly getting groped on the subway, when the car was jam packed and we were all squished together like sardines. And then I would feel that hand start to creep up my thighs and onto my ass, but couldn't tell who it was and couldn't squirm away. \n\nAt age 12, I was walking my father's dog and a man was crouched down on the sidewalk, watering the plants in front of his house with a hose. He said \"Hello\" and I turned to say hello only to see that he was wearing very short shorts and his fully erect penis was sticking out of one leg, on full display for me to see. \n\nAt age 13, I was walking down the street and chewing bubble gum. I blew a bubble with the gum and a man leaned in and whispered in my ear, \"I'll give you something to blow.\" \n\nAt age 16, I was walking to school in full daylight at 8 am. The most direct route for me to take was to cut across Central Park, so that's how I went. I was walking on the path and there next to the path in the bushes is a completely naked adult male, gyrating his pelvis at me, his hands in the air over his head. \n\nAlso at age 16, I was walking home from my swim team, it was twilight but not full dark, and a man was leaning against the base of a statue, and he asked me for a light. I said I didn't have one and kept walking, ignoring him. No one else was around. He detached himself from the base of the statue and came towards me, asking where I was going and why didn't I stay awhile. He came up behind me and grabbed my ass. I had been taking martial arts and whipped around and punched him in the sternum. (A dumb place to punch someone. I should have gone for his eyes, his knees, his throat, or his balls. Those are the vulnerable places.) But the punch was enough to startle him. I walked away and nothing worse happened to me. But it could have ended way worse for me. \n\nThese are just a few stories. I could tell more, but I'll stop there.\n\nIn case you think these stories are anomalies, ask the women in your life if they've ever experienced similar events. I can pretty much guarantee you they have. And once you have experienced these types of events, it colors your world a bit. You see the world with different eyes than a man might. Men are secure in the world in a way that women aren't. \n\nTo you, as a man, a comment about pepper spray being ineffective may seem innocuous. As a woman, I can completely understand a comment like that to be perceived as threatening and unsettling.",

Maybe he's a chill guy maybe he isn't.\n\nI don't date anymore now that I'm married with kids but I tell you though if I got out there on the dating scene and a person blows me off over a comment like that I'd just say \"okay whatever\" and move on. Some people just don't click and that's fine. I'd probably be happy it didn't work out because I like down to earth people with level heads.

I'm sure both the OP and the woman he saw are great people and it just didn't click. What makes me think this in particular is how the person setting them up said they had such matching traits such as a dark sense of humor.\n\nYou'd be surprised at how bad compatibility is between couples who are *too* similar. It actually can lead to stagnation and a boring relationship because nobody is trying anything new. Others here have pointed out she might have used the pepper spray as an excuse to leave since the OP didn't buy the drinks (which is a valid point because most women, bar the very wealthy or independent ones, like to see a man capable of supporting them financially)",

I know my statement may have been brash, and it's been like 11 hours since I posted. It just seemed amazing at the time how many people are claiming the OP is creepy or had pervert vibes and it just got me kind like, wow really?\n\nAt the end of the day I'd like to just think they are both people who didn't really click. You'd be surprised actually, the OP stated the person set them up did so because \"they both had matching traits like a dark sense of humor\", which leads me to believe two things:\n\n1. The girl used the pepper spray as an excuse to leave because he didn't buy the drinks (because this whole time I've been thinking man why didn't you buy the drinks during that time instead, that is what a lot of ladies like to see, a financially stable man)\n\n2. They were *too* similar. This might sound weird but relationship compatibility goes down by a lot when two people have a very long list of things in common. I think this is largely because they aren't discussing anything exciting they don't already know about and it becomes boring since nobody is talking about/experiencing anything new. Maybe the OP was stoked the entire time but she found the whole ordeal boring. (Most people will try to act interested at least slightly out of social respect anyway)\n\nLike I said, all just speculation at the end of the day. I'm sure they are both great people and I wasn't trying to upset anyone here.\n\nEdit: Saw the OP's edited post and it seemed to work out, so happy ending!",

A creepy comment will not illicit the same fear response as someone verbally threatening you or showing a weapon. I'm not going to speculate her reasons for leaving, for all I know she got forced into that situation when she had no interest to date in the first place. What I will say, however, is that if someone is single and actively looking for a partner, and they find someone they vibe with (again I don't know her situation , maybe the OP vibed with her but secretly she was hating it) I would find it a bit unreasonable to cut the date and burn all bridges over a single comment.\n\nIf someone is walking into a date with such primal pre-existing fear that someone is going to assault them or something, they should probably go to counseling and sort out those issues before trying to start a life with someone.\n\n>I also very much doubt that would lead into trust issues for working late, etc. This and that don't seem related like, at all.\n\nYou would be surprised what behaviors can reveal about people. I don't claim to be a psychologist or anything, but I've seen some red flags that lead into nasty and abusive relationships. Jumping to conclusions over a simple comment is one of them (again I will reiterate that I don't know this woman's situation, I'm sure she had her own reasons to leave and I can't argue with or against her since I don't know her side of the story. I'm just working off what the OP posted, and for all we know he could be sugar coating the fact he's an extreme creep)\n\nEdit: comment posted twice for some reason",

Often they aren't. \n\nThe hallmark of creeps is more often being unaware of how their actions and words come across, or even just not caring.\n\nAnd if you say something that can be interpreted as creepy, and you don't realize it, then... you're already triggering one of those quite-reasonable alarms. You're coming across as unaware, out-of-touch, about her safety and sense of safety, and that's not a great sign.",

Might be better to save it for later.\n\n\nSeeing as you managed to score a second date anyway, maybe making alternative recommendations would be the play here? You probably have some great recommendations for things that women can use to protect themselves, and sharing that kind of thing might be kind of a green flag?\n(I've often told people about things like location sharing before first dates- both as a way to help find each other and with a suggestion that they use it with someone they trust as a safety measure. You might think you're a safe person to be around, but she doesn't know that yet.)",

The burn is what impairs vision and drives focus away from being a threat and towards seeking relief, so the hotter the peppers extracted and the more synthetic capsaicin extracts used the better. It's not your responsibility to care about a potential threat's long term vision and sinus health, especially if they're an active threat to your person.

THAT was interesting. (I was maybe 7 or 8? Cousin in question has 15 years on me.) I read through it (yes, THAT was my initial introduction to sex) and put it back in her purse. \n\nThen I found the pepper spray. Thought it was perfume. Sprayed it right in my face. Knew I would get in trouble for being in cousin's purse, so I didn't scream or cry for help. I just laid there and cried it out quietly.",

I thought everyone else was doing everything wrong. They dont the deserve to be happy if I am not happy. But other people dont like bitter and negative persons. They start to avoid you and it can get quite lonely. Dont let it come this far.  \n\nInstead of looking for mistakes in everyone else maybe try to reflect on yourself once. Is there something you can improve on yourself? Dont get me wrong, your ex is most likely a huge asshole. But that doesnt mean everyone else is as well. \n\nI hope youre doing better soon.
