The regulations not only cover disabilities like loss of sight, but also cognitive issues.  Meaning, content should be clear, and readable to assistive technologies, like screen readers.\n\nThe other commenter talking about iPhones is correct.  Every popular OS (phone or computer) contains accessibility features, and has for a very long time.  There is also dedicated software and hardware that many people use.\n\nThe coding language that's used to display websites and apps can also translate what's being displayed to speech.  It's pretty simple, and the majority of my job is getting people to adhere to long-existing code and design standards, because accessibility is already well integrated into most common code bases.",

But, even if Reddit fixes the design issues, people are never going to put proper alt-text on images, or subtitle videos.  There are some bots that transcribe text overlays, like on memes, and post them them in the comments.  That's pretty cool.  Reddit could also automate that feature, but they don't.  Nobody cares unless they have to, and even then it's a struggle.",
