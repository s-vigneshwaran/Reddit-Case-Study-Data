Basically karma is in the realm of self accountability because no matter what, we learned what was good and bad in our hearts as children. So when we do something bad, no matter how hard we try to block it out, we regret it, which carries stress, which does THAT. That stress can cause someone who does genocide to a marginalized group of people to end their lives before they get to see their own consequences.\n\nMeanwhile, being born again (not as people declare that they are but by a true rebirth of the spirit) means to revert your mindset so it aligns with the heart. If you can't do that, well, your ending may not be what you desire it to be.\n\nBut ultimately we're all children in adult Mechs. The sooner we accept that and become open minded, open hearted and vulnerable, the sooner we fix this world.",

If the crazies get into power, they can subvert the will of the people's vote within each state and elect who they want. Slippery Don is in a bind because of J6 so he thinks that by announcing his candidacy, he can use the committee to his advantage among his base to get out of the trouble he's in. He's already going with the line about how \"they\" aren't coming after him, they are coming after his followers but he's standing in the way. He's rallying the people. However, the RNC, I believe, is sick of his shit so they don't want him to run or at least not say he's going to run yet. November is really important and I think we may be in a pickle because people don't vote on principles, they typically vote with their wallet. The GOP put us in a bind with all of their rich boy tax cuts, as usual, and when you add in global factors we have a lot of families struggling. The GOP blames the current administration and the people vote them into power. I know I'm stating the obvious about this tactic.",

The GOP establishment clearly does not want him at the helm again. Not because they feel bad or respect the institutions Trump et al defiled, but because Trump is an idiot who talks too much and too stupidly, and when you\u2019re trying to permanently take power over a nation or outright dismantle it, those kinds of people\u2014Trumpiscopalians if you will\u2014are huge liabilities.\n\n>I've met plenty of progressives that are infuriated with what they see from the Biden presidency, and this leads to talk of \"not voting for him\" or \"refusing to vote at all for centrist Dems\". This talk could very well lead to a loss the same way it did in 2016.\n\nMy anecdote ends on the opposite: I know a lot of progressives and, while they definitely do not believe Biden is some heroic bellwether of human progress, they recognize that having \u201cBidens\u201d or centrist dems in charge would be way better for the well-being and vitality of the American people than giving GOP fascists the reigns by not voting. I hope your friends soon come to understand that a nation with \u201cBidens\u201d at the helm would at least allow for opportunities for meaningful progress without needless violence (albeit the pace of such progress is truly painstaking). Such a process will be impossible in a Christofascist theocracy.",
