They don\u2019t care about vocal fry, or upspeak, or tone, or an emotional response. Those are simply excuses to change the subject from criticism lobbied against them. They are bigots, and bigots are bullies. Bullies seeing someone like them be an obnoxious asshole and \u201cwin\u201d against college students or whatever feeds their hierarchal power fantasy. That\u2019s all this shit is.\n\nSo yeah, when they see someone who looks like them be a shithead or obnoxious or loud towards someone they do not like (minorities and women) they *legitimately* interpret it as a good thing.",
