But if you are serious about the relationship, you should communicate more or less everything. Lack of communication is what destroys relationships. \n\nIf you are having a night out with the bois or the girls, you don't have to ask/tell your partner. BUT you should talk to them about it. \"Hey, I was gonna go out with my friends tomorrow. You didn't have anything planned, did you?\" And then you TALK about it.",

I do also understand that she didn't want to tell anyone until she was ready. But I believe that is a bad decision to not talk about it with your partner of 8 years. \n\nNow we don't have any other perspectives of the relationship, so we can only guess. Which isn't the best thing to do. I'm sure there is a ton of other stuff we are missing. Maybe her actions before telling everyone. Like maybe he would have wanted her to talk to him first before sharing in a group. Or their conversation after she came out. But we will never know.\n\nAll i do know is that, she did keep this big thing from him. Why, I dont know. Maybe she thought he'd react badly, so maybe the relationship should've ended way sooner. Or maybe he was mad that she didn't trust him to share this with him sooner, and he was deeply hurt by that. We have no idea though. \n\nSo I just fall back on she was in the wrong to keep that info from him, if she truly wanted to thrive in that relationship. But who really knows, I am not apart of their relationship.",

          "text": "> And why would you come out as bi if you planned to be in a monogamous relationship with a guy and get married? Why not keep it to yourself if you were functionally going to be in a straight relationship?\n\nIf you're looking for a genuine answer, it's the same reason why a person would be open and honest about any other emotions or experiences they might have; It's an innate desire of being human. Communication, honesty, and acceptance of identity are all incredibly important to *any* relationship. If someone feels like they need to hide part of who they are, regardless of the context, that's not healthy!\n\nThe *real* question is why do you think that's a reasonable thing to suggest? Why should she have to hide a part of herself from her would-be husband? Do you think her sexuality is completely irrelevant outside of literal sex? It still carries with it a whole host of feelings that she should feel comfortable to express openly, *particularly* with her partner, regardless of the sexual \"functionality\" of their relationship. In actuality, it's the *repression* those feelings that would likely result in a failed marriage; Being able to talk through those feelings with your partner is paramount to a lasting relationship.\n\n> Sounds like he made the right choice because you were probably going to cheat.\n\nWhat are you basing this on? Being attracted to women as well as men doesn't make her any more likely to cheat, nor does being open about her sexuality. That's one *hell* of a leap to be making, and I can only assume it's based on some pretty shitty stereotyping.\n\nFor context, you're not gonna run out and cheat on your partner whenever you find someone else attractive, are you? I sure hope not! So why would that be any different for her? Hair color, body type, etc - We all have a lengthy list of attributes that we find to be sexy and that exist among a wide range of people. Yet most of us are still plenty capable of committed, monogamous relationships. That's not any different for bisexuals.\n\nNot intending to detract from the roasting, she really do be as butch as a hung steer and twice as beefy.",

AND YOU WERE GETTING MARRIED IN A COUPLE MONTHS. Shows how much you actually gave a fuck about him. Can only imagine how he started second guessing his time with you. What a silly thing to keep hidden, and if you kept that locked up - what else are you hiding?",

To some, that isn't rock bottom. To others, that's more than they could ever possibly handle. I certainly hit rock bottom last year, with my adopted family being so cruel and mentally abusive, that they drove me into running away and almost k1lling myself. I ended up in a mental hospital for a month, and then a homeless shelter for a month after they un-adopted me, and I'd been with them for 15 years. Now that might sound lower than what you described, and maybe not. But your rock bottom is your rock bottom, even if someone else says they could handle it.",
