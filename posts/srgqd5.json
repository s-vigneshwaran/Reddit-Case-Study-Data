At first, they called it the \"Angus third pounder\" or something like that, but quickly added variations that didn't include the fraction in the name. They had names like \"Mighty Angus\" and \"Grand Angus\". I was working there when it came out and remember it being really popular . I worked in Illinois though, which I believe was one of the test states. It was apparently still pretty popular in overseas markets (Canada and Australia IIRC?) up until a year or two ago when they discontinued it. \n\nThe only reason I'm seeing for them discontinuing their Angus line was the rising cost of beef compared to chicken, (which is why chicken is all over their menu now) covid delays and such, and that they planned on expanding their quarter pounder line. It just seems like they were ready to move on with a new product line, which is something they do on a regular basis. McDonald's menu is always changing.\n\nEdit: spelling",

One aspect of the test will have the person administering the test present the tester with two words or concepts and then ask them to explain how they are similar. An example of this might be the words firetruck and stoplight. There are many ways those two things are similar; they are found on roads, both are associated with the color red, both have lights, etc. But not all correct answers are equal in terms of assessing intelligence. The person administering the test must assess the answers according to a painstakingly assembled rubric. This requires extensive training. Without that training, the score is meaningless when plotted on a normal distribution of standardized results.\n\nBut we are measuring an intelligence quotient. The results of the test are just the numerator, whither the denominator? That is achieved through years of carefully gathering vast amounts of data on individuals in each year of the testing cohort. Remember, your intelligence quotient is the results of your score divided by the score the average person of your age would be expected to score. The WAIS-V began collecting data in 2016. It remains in development. The amount of time and money necessary to develop these tests suggests that any test with loose testing protocols will be rubbish. If you are spending millions of dollars to gather the necessary data, you are not going to let any asshole with a notion administer the test. You are also going to charge a significant amount of money. If you are booking a test and no one tells you what insurance they accept, you are wasting your time.\n\nAnd there are other issues. Taking the test more than once will increase your score. Knowing the contents of a test will increase your score. A test that is given in an uncontrolled environment is useless because the results will be skewed upwards. That is another reason legitimate tests are not offered online. If someone can screenshot the questions, the test is useless. \n\nUltimately though, your IQ is not particularly meaningful outside of school or applying for government assistance. The difference between an IQ of 100 and 125 is not particularly significant to an adult living in an economy organized around extreme  specialization. Most people, even in highly educated professions, will be employed to perform a small number of specific tasks. The ability to quickly process information is meaningless in such context. Once you leave school, you will never be tasked with simultaneously processing multiple streams of disparate information. Indeed, your IQ will dictate the course of your life only if it is extremely low. In which case, you probably won't be aware of the concept of intelligence, and be perfectly ignorant of the term quotient. So really, unless you are an academic studying intelligence, you should ignore IQ scores altogether.",

It has such few implications in life unless you are incredibly gifted or have an intellectual disability. There are some times when it may come into adult life. Some professional counselors who are involved in helping people with career decisions may administer an IQ test as a way of suggesting jobs that may be appropriate, but I think that's really not the best way to do things. \n\nUnless things aren't like that. This is just something I learned from my LPC teacher in college for the semester I was in a human services program. Then quickly left when I realized the teacher had an ego issue and refused to change incorrect answers on tests, even when presented with the passage in her own PowerPoint notes or books that had the correct answer.   So maybe what I learned is wrong. That was just what she told us and even had us do assignments where we were given a scenario, like in one case it was a young man who had just lost his job at a paper mill. He did not speak English well and had an IQ of like 130 or something when given the WAIS. We then had to give suggestions for new employment or education for these people in the scenarios. I did pretty poorly on those honestly, because my teacher thought I was not taking their IQ scores into consideration enough. She said I made suggestions for things that were too difficult for the people. I don't remember too well what things I actually suggested. I may still have the word documents sitting around on my computer somewhere. I tend to save all my old school work.",

Without a trained professional, you are limited to questions that have a single correct answer. Questions that have a single correct answer are inadequate in distinguishing knowledge and intelligence. And that is just addressing the I part of IQ. You have to standardize the Q component as well, which requires data from outside the population being tested. To my knowledge, the only tests that have collected the data necessary to standardize the age cohorts are the tests that can only be administered by a trained professional. Now, it is entirely possible to evaluate intelligence in a different manner. You just won't end up with an IQ score. Which is what we are discussing.",

A common method of evaluating one's IQ score is mapping the test score to a normal distribution. Most commonly used scale has a standard deviation of 15 or 16. For example, a Stanford-Binet score uses SD = 16, so 2 SD above mean (i.e. 132) would land you top 2.1% of population. Imagine you take some random test in the Internet and they claim your IQ is 160 or something bullshit number, it means nothing without knowing the mean and SD of their scale, in addition to the test being bullshit as well.\n\nSo whenever you saw clickbaity news titles of a 10 year old kid having IQ higher than Einstein and joins Mensa blah blah blah, it means nothing. Plus 160 IQ is just top 0.0088% in a 16 SD scale, there're shitloads of people having higher IQ than Einstein. I don't even know what's the IQ of Einstein anyways, not something one should care.\n\nAlso, different local Mensas have different tests, the test I took (I was 14, the min. age allowed by my local Mensa) was 45 very classic 3x3 grid pattern recognition multiple choices in 20 minutes. I think some Mensas also take certified test scores from 3rd party organizations, which you have to refer to the guidelines in your local Mensa.  While there's a continuous debate on the accuracy of IQ test and is it a good measure of one's intelligence, all I can say is Mensa supervised tests are usually the standard ones, for example, [UK Mensa uses the Cattell III B and the Cattell Culture Fair III A](https://www.mensa.org.uk/what-is-an-iq-test).",

Consumers and 'health-nuts' everywhere were buying into some strange gluten-free trend. The majority of companies greenwashed their products to appeal to the fad that seemingly gluten was deadly to normal people.\n\nSide-effects of this included already gluten-free products having to state that they were gluten-free just to keep their sales intact. There was a reddit comment I read awhile back stating that his friend owned a steakhouse and people were buying less steaks until he realized he needed to label them 'gluten-free' to get his patrons to order them again. Meat doesn't natural contain gluten to begin with; it's reminiscent of the way Oreo's and other things are 'accidental-vegan', and the whole MSG scare back from the 70-80s. \n\nAdding the suffix \"-free\" or \"-less\" to a product's ingredients list was killer PR to get a ton of people to buy your crap over a competitors'. You'll still see some things plastering 'gluten-free' on the front of its packaging even today; though most companies now just put it on the back in the \"May Contain: ...\" section which lists things like, wheat, soy, milk, nuts, fish, and other allergens.",

Since water (H2O) is a chemical substance, you can use chemical naming rules to make it sound evil: the most popular of those names is Dihydrogen Monoxide (abbreviated DHMO; although you could use the even more unfamiliar name of Hydroxyl Acid) and scare people XD: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihydrogen\\_monoxide\\_parody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihydrogen_monoxide_parody) The joke has been around since the 1980's; with quite interesting outcomes (there are documented cases of politicians taking actions to restrict or ban the use of this dangerous thing).",

It's about working to reduce your exposure to potentially low-toxicity items. An example of this is the removal of fragrance. Is fragrance in your trash bags going to kill you? Not a chance. Could it contribute to other chemical exposure based sensitivities? Highly unlikely. Are fragrant trash bags necessary? Nope. As such, if you have the option to buy non-fragrance based trash bags--why wouldn't you? There is a long history of \"oops, it turns out chemical X causes problems in a subset of the population\", lack of regulatory control, and so much that just can't be tested in any reasonable way to determine correlation to other issues.\n\nMy wife cares about this a lot more than I do, but having gone along for the ride I went from \"this is dumb\" to \"it's not that much more work and probably better for us in the long run\". I used the fragrance as an example because now that we're \\~5 years out from doing this, it's crazy how quickly you can pick up other peoples laundry detergent standing next to them (and I can smell cologne a mile away).\n\nThe Environmental Working Group ([https://www.ewg.org/](https://www.ewg.org/)) is a semi-decent cross check for most items.\n\nThe biggest issue with this is people are so fucking black and white about how they approach problems. You don't need to be 100% cHeMiCaL fReE, just work on reduction. I still use Dawn occasionally (nothing cuts grease like Dawn) every few weeks on oil crusted pans/bakeware, but for day to day use and things like silverware the hippy shit works just as well.",

When we go for walks we can smell our neighbours laundry in the dryer because of the laundry detergent and dryer sheets. \n\nWhen my mother leaves after a visit and I sit on the couch where she sat I can instantly smell her laundry detergent and perfume. \n\nLike you said, it's not about eliminating *everything* but rather reducing as much as possible.  Bio-accumulation is a serious issue in our world. \n\nI know there will be people who say we've had this stuff for years and are fine, etc, etc.  We spend a lot of time in our homes (especially these last 2 years) mainly sleeping but also more so in the winter so reducing exposures to these things along with a healthy diet and exercise is our best bet at a long and healthy life.",

Horribly odiferous, leave a slimy feeling on your clothes, prevent your clothes from actually getting clean, and make towels less absorbant and vaguely squeeky. And even if YOU don't use them but others using the same machine do, they coat the inside of the dryer and get all over everyone's things anyway. Ugh. Fuck dryer sheets, man. \n\nAlso, if you're a sweaty sleeper and use them on your sheets, you're only making the issue worse. Since they deposit a hydrophobic residue that prevents the fabric from wicking moisture away (same reason they make towels less absorbant and prevent fabrics from getting clean), you just end up in little swampy swimming pools of your own sweat. Sneaky sneaky snakes.\n\n\n\n... I apparently have very strong feelings about dryer sheets lmao",

We use wool balls and they work wonderfully. \n\nWe do not use cleaners with synthetic fragrances or \"strong chemicals\" as some would classify them as.  I've had friends come over and say my house just smells \"like house\". No overpowering perfumes.  We have an HRV that runs all year round to bring fresh air in, yes, yes, I know.   Humidity control and all that. I don't mind paying a little extra to have fresh air all year round when the weather is not ideal for open windows.  The HRV is shut down during high pollution times like the wildfires in Northern Ontario last summer.  But I live in a rural part of Ontario so city air pollution is very low in my area. \n\nNo, I'm not perfect in eliminating all pollutants.  That's not my goal.  My goal is to reduce exposure where I can. \n\nIncluding you, dryer sheets.",

I have read that gifted kid burnout stems from perfectionism and asynchronous development (mismatch between cognitive & emotional development) & unmatched expectations.  It's not like an official diagnosis, it's just a common phenomenon. It's also likely that some kids just develop faster cognitively and the other kids catch up by senior year.\n\nI was a gifted kid with ADHD which they call \"Twice-Exceptional\"  (gifted kid with neurodivergence). In that case those kids struggle because they are smart but the system is not adapted to their learning and work styles. We also tend to underperform in subjects that don't interest us.\n\nFor me it was things like organziational skills that held me back. I always outperformed at my grade level but wasn't able to keep up in honors or AP classes. I wasn't bad at college but felt like I was failing when it didn't come easy to me. I re-enrolled in college in my 30s and with more developed life skills college was easy.",

I was testing above average all through out elementary school so I wasn\u2019t surprised by being picked.  I was \u201cweird\u201d and me one other weird kid tested the highest. \n\nIn highschool there was no enrichment only on track or high track clases.\n\n Idk how other schools decide what is \u201cgifted\u201d.  But a process like that where they just select some top kids to take a test is definitely not a scientific process. I probably could have used more emotional or organizational learning as much as i needed a gifted class.",

Maybe students would get overlooked if the whole thing is boiled down to one test. I wonder if we can test for cognitive and behavioral needs of the student. I think that school overall would be improved by creating more personalized curiculuum for all students.\n\nOne of the pitfalls of being \"Gifted\" is that those students miss out on opportunities to learn how to learn. Because they absorb information much faster than their peers they don't get the practice of studying. If teachers had the resources to just provide more levels of assignments there would be no reason to label anyone as gifted or average. The focus of learning could be on progress rather than perfection. \n\nIn my first writing class in college my teacher failed my first paper. She also gave everyone the opportunity to re-write one paper for a better grade. & We had to resubmit all of the papers at the end of the semester *with corrections* as a portfolio. I definitely failed or got bad grades before I went to college but I never had a teacher who focused on progress before. The point wasn't to get it right, it was to learn. She also took atleast an hour to go over my paper with me. She challenged me to think deeper about my topic and showed me how to use analysis in my writing rather than just stating the facts. \n\nGifted programs could also be improved by encorporating social and emotional learning.  Social and emotional intelligence is something that gifted kids also fall behind on. \n\nI think if we re-imagined classrooms in these ways it would matter less who tested really well because the focus would be on progress. All students could get better opprtunities because they could be available to all the students. Obviously, that would be difficult to do with the resources that schools have. But I'm an idealist.",

Sorry, you meant a situation where they took an exam that covered everything they got wrong on all the previous exams for that semester, in addition to the final?  Still a really great deal!",

It would essentially be another, shorter version of the same exam, but with a little more emphasis on what they had deficits in.\n\nAnd no, it would not have to be at the end of the semester.  They could have scheduled the extra supplementary exam anytime during the semester.  Or they could do it at the end of the semester anytime during exam week, or shortly thereafter as long as I had time to grade it before we had to submit the grades.\n\nI know from experience as an undergrad how sometimes you have multiple exams in a week, so you might not be able to devote as much time as you need/want in order to absorb everything.\n\nThis was my way of sort of compensating for this particular kind of problem with the \"formal structure\" of our educational system.",

I can understand feeling very alone when you're no longer around children your own age, but being around them yet unable to really relate to them is just as isolating, plus the constant unending boredom. My first boyfriend in my teens was another gifted kid and it was amazing to have that reprieve of someone sane and interesting to talk to who wasn't an adult and thus actually took me seriously. His very supportive parents \"unschooled\" him and let him pursue his interests, so he did his Master's at CERN getting a 4.0 in particle physics and ended up in tech, but even he burned out emotionally by 20 and drank a lot. I kind of suspect that there may not be any correct or even mostly correct way of raising a gifted kid. The general reaction is \"wah wah smart person problems\" just like you get \"wah wah rich person problems\", but I guess the reality is simply that intelligent people and rich people are no less vulnerable to mental health issues and likely more vulnerable.",

No money is involved, just ridiculously hard entrance exams (elite high school math entrance exam would fail all US college students in non-STEM and a decent chunk in STEM, if they don't prepare for it).

Typically speaking, true prodigies are incredibly rare, and while they are extremely accelerated in terms of intelligence, they often are still pretty emotionally and mentally immature, and often don't reach true maturity due to the people around them only acknowledging their success and not telling them of their failures, so they basically just live in an echo chamber that tells them how great they are and how they can do no wrong. As you might imagine, that's pretty bad. It's the main reason why you never hear about modern prodigies going on to do amazing things, besides the fact that they basically just speedran from school to corporate at a rate that they weren't supposed to go at.\n\nHell, most Honors and Accelerated students in special programs are just the product of a very strict emphasis from their parents on study, which presents an entirely different variety of issues. Some of these students are pretty smart, but others are simply being driven by their parents to over perform which causes them undue stress and frustration. No one should feel bad for being average, but for some reason we decide to compare people who had lucky headstart over others to someone else who learns at an average pace that they are comfortable with, instead of forcing themselves to push beyond their normal limits for no reason beyond a point average that means little, and letters that mean even less.",

I was gifted, high IQ (officially), was in all the special programs, had senior classes as a freshman in highschool (which was a boon actually because I never got bullied by upperclassmen despite being socially awkward from spending so much time focusing on school and less socializing with other kids)\n\nFlamed out spectacularly in college due to burnout, joined the workforce, excelled and parlayed that into starting a business.  Started strong and failed due to not knowing how expand beyond the initial growth phase.  Learned that raw intelligence is not enough to sustain a business, there are critical things you can't intrinsically know.\n\nWent back to the workforce and became the guy \"Why is this broken/abandoned/not used/inefficient?\"  Would take own my own side project and end up solving the problem that nobody tried to or was able to successfully resolve.  Ultimately fucked myself because I was then never able to get any promotions because I was \"too good\" in my role or \"the only one who can do x\".\n\nMy personality type is once I've solved x, I'm basically done with it and ready to tackle y, etc.  So being pigeonholed like that sucks the life out of me.",

These executives cannot grasp being told that I'm not designed this way, that my ability to master something doesn't translate to executive management, that I can't simply \"teach\" others to be capable of such things.\n\nI will say that had I not landed in IT consulting, I probably wouldn't have very well, I'd likely still be playing in bands and working as a mechanic or fishermen or some shit.",

We are the complete opposites, But She luckily didn't get burnout from the pressure of our divorced parents projecting themself on her, the teacher and instructors.  We may not get along, but We agree that I got burned out after I got a couple years in my first job and she is starting to show signs of burnout herself now. I never found a job I liked or a career path I wanted to follow, and now I'm lucky if I can manage to convince myself to finish a Character sheet for my TTRPGs even when I have a week.",

It doesn't matter if it's fishing, hiking, hunting, D&D, PC gaming, retro console gaming, pokimon collecting / MTG, cross-stitch, painting, cooking, baking, writing, something that you can't get enough of, and do it at least once a week, give yourself goals / metrics to meet in order to earn it / reward yourself. If you're not married and don't have any kids, grab a backpack, a passport and whatever you can scrounge, couch surf for a few months to save up if you have to and go tour EU or Asia on the cheap (hostils, camping/tramping, get away from everything that drags you down and out of your cycle / routine. You're probably still under 30, I doubt you've really even had much opportunity to find yourself.\n\nTL/DR, disrupt your current situation, abruptly if need be, don't continue to fold in upon yourself, the longer you do, the harder it will be to climb out.",

My lack of life experience is one thing I've been trying to work on with little success I have never dated, only been out of the US twice(forcefully dragged by family), never left the state I live in by myself, never been overseas, never taken a cruise, never done a lot of stuff now that I think about it. About I have done is Work to live, cook, read, game, go to the shooting range once a year and surf the net on rare occasions I'm not even on reddit that much(maybe once or twice every two week unless I have an ongoing conversation which I will check on once or twice a day.).",

I know it sounds wicked cliche, but you have to seek discomfort, otherwise, we end up alone because we alienated ourselves.\n\nSeriously, what do you have to lose? Your situation couldn't possibly get worse by putting yourself out there, trying new things, trying to travel (even alone). If you're in a foreign state or country, what do you really have to lose by trying out ways to communicate with strangers that you'd never try at home? While it'd feel crazy, it's not like you'd really have to worry about being embarrassed, you'll likely never see anyone again if it gets weird and you move on to the next place, hopefully a little more comfortable putting yourself out there. I mean, you're not going to become a social butterfly or anything, but I'd bet that you'd be capable of much more social interaction than you give yourself credit for because at home it's way too easy to hide away in your home and only do bare minimums.\n\nI mentioned hiking, maybe camping because you're often put in situations where you can really feel alive and accomplished when you do them, really do wonders for self confidence, the good kind of boosters that are real, not other people blowing smoke up your ass telling you what you want to hear.\n\nI'm telling you dude, get out there and just do something, anything! If you can still walk and get around easily enough then it's never too late.",

If you spend 10,000 hours studying quantum physics, you'll become an expert at it.  That's all there is to it.  Depression saps that motivation and focus to accomplish these types of goals.\n\nThe other issue is that kids can change their behaviors much more easily than adults.  Getting a kid to work hard and hard wire those habits can be done far quicker, too.  \n\nThe entire idea behind anti-depressants (in most cases) is that you use the meds to fix your habits, and then when you come off of them, those bad habits are gone and you're more balanced.  It's easy to fall back into old habits the longer you do them, too.",

You still need to put in the work.  The only difference is a \"gifted\" kid has their adult capabilities when it comes to logical processes early.  That momentum can be a huge advantage, but it's also easily wasted.  \n\nIf you want a PhD, go get one.  You're just as capable as any former \"gifted\" child.

Simply telling yourself you can't makes it harder to do it.  You might not be able to do it as easily as someone who has been doing math like that for years, but if you started today, in a few years you could be able to.  It's like exercise.  Practice, practice, practice.  You aren't magically different from all other people.  Everyone has the ability, and there is no inherent limit to whatever skill you choose to focus on that you have that others don't.\n\n>My kids were better mathemematicians than me or you by the time they hit third grade.

Kids absorb information faster, and you haven't done math (beyond normal, everyday math) in years if you're an average adult in an career that doesn't require it.  Go look up the countless studies around \"growth mindsets\". You'll see that this is newly discovered stuff that proves you objectively wrong.  \n\nKids can learn faster, but that doesn't mean you're stuck with whatever skills you currently have.",

Ever. My parents always launched straight into, \"Oh, those assholes are so horrible! The world is horrible and I can't believe that horrible thing happened to you! Everything sucks!\"\n\nThere was never any acknowledgement that I felt bad and just needed comfort and love. They only reinforced the fact that the world was horrible, and then they followed it up by victim-blaming my own feelings: \"Ugh, stop crying! How could you *let* those jerks *make you* feel bad? If you turn into a sad sack, that means they win!\"",

I realized pretty early on that I could just listen to lectures and then get a perfect score on any test to follow with zero or minimal studying.  I basically internalized over the years that I was just inherently smarter than almost everyone I ever met.  It was true, but also not a useful thing to know to be true, and also I was kind of an ass about it at times.\n\nThe end result was that I never really developed strong study habits or discipline, and I started to see a lot of life as being pointless busy work which left me disillusioned and depressed about the future.  Also, when I finally started getting into academic situations that really did test me in college, I felt unprepared for how to cope with the level of work I would have to do to succeed.  When I got into academic situations where I was no longer setting the curve, I had kind of an identity crisis because it felt like I lost my superpower.\n\nI tried to cope with that by going deep into the college partying/drinking culture.  At one point I was getting buzzed 6 days a week and completely wasted 3-4 nights a week.  It was only when I was on the brink of failing out of college that I had the \"oh shit\" moment and kind of re-learned how to do school.  The upside was that all of that drinking and socializing made me a much more interesting, fun person to hang out with because \"I'm better than all of you\" was not a fun person to invite out, but \"fun drinking guy who can do fast math at the bar\" was a great buddy to invite.\n\nBeing \"gifted\" has lots of obvious, great advantages.  But I also feel like my life would have been a lot happier if I'd have been smart enough to succeed with good effort instead of smart enough to succeed without effort.",

Like the family depicted in the image, not smart enough to know how dumb they are.\n\nI know this isn't unique to Americans, but we damn sure have been propagandized our whole lives to believe we are exceptional just because of where we were born. That leads to people that instead of bettering themselves through education they would rather complain that their rightful due was stolen from them.  Basically, I hate how right you are.",

When I started failing elementary school classes, my parents started bailing me out by telling all the teachers I was too bored to pay attention and please just pass me in exchange for a book report or something.\n\n- I still can't concentrate on anything very well because my mind wanders and I start thinking about random topics like history or geopolitics or recent conversations or something.",

I passed their bullshit screening tests \"better than anyone else ever had\" and got along well with everyone. \n\nAs the final step, the interviewer handed me an IQ tests and told me I had a time limit to finish it. He sat me in the middle room of 6 other offices where everyone was having conversations and making noises. I was fucking livid. I don't even know how I did on the test, they just ghosted me. It could have been that, it could have been my commute distance.\n\nBut, in general, fuck you if you ghost an applicant after 2 interviews and a ride a long. Seriously.",

Went back to HS through an online program at age 18, it lasted one year. First career done at age 22. Second by age 24. The third one is technically not done yet, but Im almost there so I just say I already have the 3rd one. Software development, Psychology and QA engineer, in case you're wondering.\n\nBesides my time as everything you've already read, I was also the youngest Operations Manager for Amazon Order Support at age 20 (back then at least, no clue whether that still holds up). Just letting you know in advance since you seem to be stalking me, you might eventually make it to the comments where I talk about my experience as an OM there.",

This gives them a baseline performance from which to compare.\n\nThe scores are also broken down into components, like processing speed, and then averaged. A person may have amazing performance, but their processing speed is low. This will pull down their overall score. So the overall score only gives an idea of where section scores will fall.

If the overall score is 80 - doctors know *something* is up and can go through the results to see which area(s) dragged the score down.\n\nThe purpose of the test isn't to see how smart someone is, it's to see what areas may be affecting their functioning, and what accommodations and support may be helpful.",

If the kid has an IQ of 80 at 14, he will most likely still have a score in that range at 30. The only saving grace for this kid could be that the test might be inaccurate (due to it being an online test) or that the kid purposely messed it up or didn't put any effort in. For example, I remember scrolling through one of those online IQ tests once and answering like 3 questions, leaving the rest of them blank. The test calculated a score of like 75 because of that.

I'm reasonably intelligent but certainly not up there in the genius territory. IQ tests are supposed to be *hard* - otherwise they can't accurate gauge anything above like 130 IQ.\n\nBut I guess hard tests are demoralizing and that just won't do when you need those sweet, sweet likes and shares.",

I\u2019ve been pondering about the idea of smoking marijuana flower and tobacco leaf to lower my IQ quite substantially. I am aiming for an IQ of around 170-175, which I believe I could live in a more comfortable state of intelligence, and would finally be able to communicate in ways that most of my friends and family could understand. Even though they are all sub 100\u2019s, I am still in complete awe about the way they think and act. They are nothing more than mentally challenged chimpanzees to me, grunting and beating their chests while talking about their useless \u201cjobs\u201d, \u201ceducation\u201d, or the amount \u201cmoney\u201d they have. I am God compared to them, and I should be worshipped as such. I was gifted with divine intelligence, but they treat me like I am mentally ill. Society has cornered me, I am forced to live in the confines of my great uncle\u2019s furnished attic, and the only way I can communicate to the outside world is through the internet. \n\nHaving a high IQ is nothing to brag about.\nFrom my experience, it\u2019s nothing more than just having another psychiatric disorder.",

An IQ tests only tells you how big the measuring cup is, but it doesn't tell anyone what you've chosen to fill it with.  So... if you have a measuring cup in - say - the top 10% of the biggest measuring cups out there... but you've chosen to fill it full of shit...\n\nFor example:. I have a friend who told me he had his IQ measured when he signed up to join the Navy, probably to determine whether or not they could legally allow him to join, (because he's borderline ret- ... \"mentally challenged\").  The military does not normally give recruits IQ tests... they do aptitude tests, to determine job placement, but not IQ tests.  They made him a cook (it was the ONLY job they would allow him to do, because he scored the absolute bare minimum to get in).\n\nI also joined the Navy, but they did NOT make me take an IQ test, and I scored in the top 5% on their aforementioned aptitude test... they let me work on nuclear missiles.\n\nIn his spare time, he takes garbage (disposed plastic items like deodorant dispensers, bottle caps, etc...) and makes incredibly detailed art with them.  The work he puts into then is phenomenal, I couldn't even imagine where to begin making something as amazing as the things he can dream up.  Starting with a laundry detergent bottle, he made a Star-Wars-esque space ship that's as good as anything a Lucas Arts modeler has ever made.  --- In my spare time, I argue with people on the internet about subjects as indepth as \"should of\" or \"should have\"; which political party is the dumbest; and whether or not I personally think \"you\" are an asshole.\n\nSo, you tell me... which of us is \"smarter\"?",

I always assumed it was because most folks with IQ down that way aren't all that big on concepts like IQ and the ones who are, well, they know what it means.  \n\nThat is, there is a certain minimum IQ that is pretty much a necessity in order to understand and appreciate the way the evaluations work, and even though I truly believe that most people, even those with lower capacity for complex thinking as is the idea behind IQ, still have some positive characteristics and \"intelligence\".  IQ is hardly everything after all.  There are lots of ways of being \"smart\" without being pattern/structure-oriented \"smart\".  I have also seen some pretty high IQ folks who aren't all that bright in a number of other ways.  We aren't machines after all.\n\nBut yeah, I have two ways of thinking on this: no need to be cruel and point out the mistake, but also lots of folks these days think they are freaking geniuses (stable ones, even) who obviously are not, and really have to be told because they act on their misguided self-importance.",

Which means he's smarter than 9.12% of grown adults.  I mean, look at the analogy it gives: If he were one of 1000 people all in the same room, he would be smarter than 91 of them.  But that also means that there are 908 people smarter than your boy.\n\n\"If you want him to get smarter, encourage him to read books other than Bible Stories for Kids, and take away the GTA games.  Give him Harry Potter books.  Give him adventure and puzzle games like a \"The Legend of Zelda\" game (adventure) or Portal (puzzle).  Make sure he exercises regularly too.  The mind is generated by the brain, and if the rest of the body is functioning properly, then the brain gets everything it needs to function properly also.\n\n\"And for goodness' sake, get him vaccinated!  There is NOTHING nefarious going on with vaccines!  They simply reduce the likelihood of him dying from whatever disease they're meant to protect against.\"",

It is a measure of a specific kind of intelligence which only gives the right result under specific conditions. This is not what I said, this is what they said. You can also improve your IQ as the test for children WCIS is different, so it's entirely possible you score low as a child and then work on patterns etc and score high as an adult.",

It's a good snapshot of the effect of a particular stressor on a group, and also was used to fully ban lead in the 80s (Reagan was such an asshole, he wanted all restrictions removed from lead in gasoline). \n\nIn the IQ tests you see these scores on, 100 is always the average for your age. The amount of knowledge needed to get 100 has gone up a lot since the tests were first administered- someone with an IQ of 120 in 1910 would be assessed for learning disabilities in 2010. \n\nhttps://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/projects/radiolab-presents-g\n\nThis is a good exploration if you want to learn more.",

Children should be tested using WISC not a stupid online questionnaire.\nHowever regarding IQ scores generally, 100 is the \"average\", ie someone smack bang in the middle. Most normally intelligent people are between 90-110, above average is 111-120, gifted is 121+, below average is 70-89 and below 70 is a learning disability.   \nUsually people who claim 121+ online are unemployed neckbeards who think they're special when really they're just socially awkward weirdos.",

      "text": "I suffer from a variety of mental issues that I\u2019m still not fully aware of but I can\u2019t help but feel that a higher IQ correlates to this. Past a certain range. Somewhere past 110, I\u2019m leaning on past 120 being an indication for \u201cthere\u2019s no way you\u2019re not suffering mentally somehow\u201d.\n\nI\u2019ve taken a few IQ tests, each being many years apart and yes, you can study for them but I\u2019ve never studied a day in my life. I just can\u2019t, I become very lost and bored and usually depressed. Still, somehow manage to score past 120. For the scores I can remember exactly, at 14 I was 121, at around 18 I was 129, and most recently at 24 I\u2019m a 136. I got all the answers right but wasn\u2019t aware that time impacted my score and I think if I rushed I\u2019d somehow end up slower if that makes sense. I have like 3 subconscious minds and each watches the other when I take tests or think in patterns or puzzles. Fact checking or peer reviewing the priors thoughts and inputs. I also tend to dissociate and I believe this is part of how I think and has been for as long as I can remember. At times it gets real bad and I feel like we\u2019re all just this one true collective consciousness, pretending to be everything and everyone we come across. But it\u2019s like I don\u2019t know how to pretend, as if I never actually knew how. So the I just wonder and ponder on everything and I mean everything. Who am I? Who are they? Who and how?\n\nI believe who is you, as in we\u2019re all just you. You acting out every possibility, here and elsewhere. All happing and all at once. It\u2019s all just then the \u201chappening\u201d. Infinites that infinitely become more infinite and so infinite that even the beginning is infinitely furthering. It\u2019s all just now then I say. Always has been and always will be. I\u2019m just one of you that\u2019s living out this specific experience then, being aware of itself and everything. Ignorance is bliss and I think that\u2019s all I could gain from this experience.\n\nSounds crazy right? Well take a moment to realize where you are right now. It\u2019s all crazy. And you\u2019ve just accepted it all without wondering? No, you definitely wonder, a part of you deep down does but you play on and pretend. Keep on pretending, it\u2019s not worth knowing. If it ever clicks, you\u2019ll never be able to pretend again. Not until next time.\n\nI am you. Here\u2019s a thought experiment. Imagine that instead of your consciousness inside your body since the moment you were born, we instead place my subconscious in its place. Would anything change? Would the me inside your vessel appear different in expression, emotion, decision making, and or personality? I say no. I would have been exactly as you are now. How could that be? Well, why do you act, think, see, feel, are the way you are? Well you could say your upbringing, your feelings from your human chemistry, the life experiences you\u2019ve faced, the decisions you\u2019ve made along the way with all those prior factors. And I say exactly. Any consciousness you place in your vessel from the start would have been the exact same as you are now. They would have had your upbringing, feel your human chemistry since it\u2019s the same vessel, made the same mistakes and successes as they\u2019d have made every decision you had made with all those prior traits. They would have been you, and that\u2019s why you are the way you are. You\u2019re the same consciousness that resides in all consciousness beings. You\u2019re also the only one that\u2019s actually here right now and forever. It\u2019s how it\u2019s always been. Just you pretending and playing along. Deep down you know, but you\u2019re good at pretending so you know how to steer away from that truth. Keep on pretending, there\u2019s nothing to gain from knowing.\n\nI wonder what came first and yet the answer is everything at once. The subconsciousness of a consciousness or the actions of a consciousness. Well if I\u2019m currently conscious of this and others are not, then yeah, all at once. There\u2019s others that know of course. The others are just you after all. So then why? Were we that lonely? Or were that curious to know what would everything look like? That, I\u2019ll never know as I am now. Because I\u2019m the you that\u2019s pretending to be unaware to that still if I truly know. I know I\u2019m worried what waking up is like but I believe it just means I end up back here. We\u2019ve been here for a very, very, long time. All of it actually.\n\nI\u2019m sorry btw. For you, you\u2019ve been through more pain than I know and you\u2019ll be through even more pain as we go on. But if I\u2019m truly sorry, then I guess that means that, I love you.\n\nHappy Valentine\u2019s Day.",

              "text": "Ideal, I had issues with reading and learning. I also can\u2019t see thoughts, recently found out that people actually see what they \u201cthink up\u201d in their minds. Supposedly I was supposed to be left handed but was swapped to my right hand sometime in preschool and I\u2019ve read some studies that it can mess with a child\u2019s mind. How they learn, or think. Might explain why reading was difficult as well as writing letters the correct way. I could only spell my full name after 2nd grade.\n\nI remember at some points when I would shower, I\u2019d feel familiar. Maybe I\u2019ve experienced these days before or this feeling of existing. I was maybe 10 at the time. I just always got lost in these thoughts that something was off. Then I wondered the worst of things like what if death was purgatory or maybe that the universe would at some point collapse into itself erasing everything. At first I was so freighted I\u2019d bang on the bathroom walls and scream. But there was still the part of me that knew I\u2019d freak out my parents. All the sudden I felt split emotionally. Part of me wants to play along the other believes there\u2019s something bigger I\u2019m not allowing myself to ponder on.\n\nI\u2019m currently undergoing TMS, that magnetic brain treatment to make me \u201chappy\u201d. I\u2019m about to be. Three fifths of the way done. I feel the same. Previous brain scans along with blood work had shown that my dopamine levels were close to none, some other stuff was off too. Basically experiencing happiness or the thrills of life isn\u2019t really possible for me. They said that maybe when I was younger and smaller I had it better as my body was easier to supply my small supply of chemistry. I can tell the older I\u2019m getting the worse each year is for me to handle. I feel like I\u2019m less and less human, becoming something that\u2019s just conscious and empty. \n\nIt\u2019s gotten pretty bad too. I dissociate almost everyday day now. Started hearing familiar voices or sounds like the washing machine even though it\u2019s not on and no one but me is here. I\u2019m not paranoid as that would feel like something of a thrill, exciting even. So I\u2019m aware these are just illusions. A bit interesting at the very least, nothing creepy ever happens and I\u2019ll purposely walk to the kitchen with no lights on in the middle of the night, just hoping for something interesting to happen. But that hasn\u2019t happened, so far.\n\nI\u2019ve thought most of my life. Since I was young. About things people shouldn\u2019t think about. And I\u2019ve come to my conclusions and now everything just seems pointless? Not sure how I\u2019d describe it but it feels as though we\u2019ve been here forever and I\u2019d like to not be here anymore. So I\u2019m just waiting. See if anything interesting happens or see just how much pain I can take before it\u2019s either too much or I\u2019m no longer capable to feel anything at all. I am growing more numb as time goes on. Makes you become an addict to what you can even experience, like emotional pains. That\u2019s a toxic hole to go down. Leads to self hatred. And I\u2019ve hated myself for longer than I\u2019ve been around it feels like. But yeah, that\u2019s me. Thanks for your time.",

                      "text": "Thank you for the helpful advice and for taking the time to write back to me.\n\nShort term and long term, I have no idea honestly. Maybe figuring that out is what I've been trying to do. I puzzle myself honestly and I don't have me figured out quite yet. I hope I can but I'm not easy to work with when it comes to being open with myself. Definitely a lot of self hatred but part of me keeps trying and I say that is either the little bits of love I have or it's just all the care I have for others in my life. My mother and father primarily. I wouldn't want them hurt if say I ended my life, I also don't feel as though that solves anything but I can see why others have taken their lives. Pain is different for each person and they're not to be compare but all pain is truly tormenting. If that pain never heals, I think life just feels like survival or torture.\n\nI have taken on many hobbies. I try to give anything new a go and truly appreciate what it is. Like Chess, Tennis, Instruments, Photography, etc. Problem is I have trouble feeling anything more for these hobbies other than the initial curiosity for them. I lack the chemistry to really develop a love for practically anything. Lack the enjoyment of being engaging with said hobbies. I find that I take them on if they're interesting in anyway to me but for the purpose of distraction. Meaning the more difficult or complex these things are to me, makes it more for me for a time.\n\nSo I think it's best if I see how this TMS treatment goes along with attending my therapy sessions to get some practical advice or unbiased input on how I view the world and act around myself. Other than that, I don't know really. Helping others is fun though, their problems can't be solved overnight but when they eventually change for the better, it's beautiful. I won't lie though, I tend to only enjoy those people while they seem interesting. If their sad I'm interested because I believe they can save themselves. I'd like to remind them that but I'd also enjoy watching them transform. It's this same transformation that I dislike in people as well. People can change, sometimes they can change for the worst. Still, even that is interesting to me, because it hurts me and that's an emotion I can actually experience. Nothing quite as bitter or stings quite as sharp as betrayal or abandonment. I believe I don't self sabotage but I definitely am addicted. It's a problem I would like to fix but as I try I continue to get harmed. Recently even but I'm sure the answer to that is to keep trying. Trying is all I can really do.\n\nAnd one last thing. Just realized that I don't change much in mindset. Could be the lack of chemistry or a mix of all these things. I'm always in this similar mindset throughout my life, only thing that changes is what I come to experience and learn from but my emotions are always the same feelings of being hollowed out or feeling empty. But others can change and that is both amazing to me as well as terrifying. Not literally, but I know that I can be emotionally hurt by others so I keep a distance. The kindest of people can have a moment of rage, that saddens me. More so saddening is when it's a long term progression towards hatreds or malice-ness, pettiness even. Just felt I should mention that because I'm not sure how others feel about the human ability to change as a person.\n\nThank you again. Friend.",

People tend to do better on IQ tests when they get older so to get actual IQ results before you\u2019re an adult you need IQ tests whose results are scaled towards people of a similar age. In other words, as this kid gets older and his brain matures, he\u2019ll probably reach an average IQ score of 100 or around there. Even gifted kids who end up with scores of 120+ get below average scores when their test results are compared to the population as a whole which is mostly made up of adults who have an large edge on most children, even gifted ones.\n\nBut oof is that parent bad at reading comprehension and double checking results.",
