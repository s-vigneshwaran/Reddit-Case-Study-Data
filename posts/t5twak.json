It\u2019s fucking bullshit but I have to deal with it because my wife gets the single garage-spot at our apartment. Shit pisses me off just thinking about it. Someone can literally do whatever they want to your property and you have to pay for the repairs yourself.\n\nI wish they\u2019d just steal it and wrap it around a tree so I could at least get a new car.",

Meanwhile, Sweden is among the best, with universal easily accessible healthcare, and 18 months of parental leave, for example.\n\nEdit: sorry, just realised you said Germany, not Sweden.

It's also why the US power grid seems outdated: we got it first (widespread) and *didn't* get it bombed-and-replaced.\n\nThe world has changed a *lot* in human memory.

The KJV was just re-codifying Anglican beliefs and making it accessible to those who were literate at the time (which was many more than prior to this time period, although still reserved for the upper classes). Previously most versions of the Bible were in Latin and reserved for religious scholars. In some ways it's a unification of the Arthurian legend, Christian beliefs and contemporary pagan practices whilst trying to undermine the competitive power of religious leaders both inside and out of the country. The power is consolidated into the monarchy allowing for essentially a theocratic monarchy.\n\nThis is part of the reason why the US constitution specifies a separation of church and state.",

They would be able to live off the land, make their own weapons, and so on while they travelled. They started out around 1210 AD.\n\nThere were about 30,000 of them, and they just ... disappeared. Mainly into slavery in Russia, or buried all over the place. There are still villages in Central Europe with unexpected genetics who are probably their descendants.\n\nI have heard this is the basis of the Pied Piper of Hamlein, tempting the children away because he was not paid for leading all the rats out of the city.",

I know that the belief Catholics are not really Christians was extremely widespread and expected, but because my extended family was and is primarily Catholic, that wasn't something that was believed in our house. (My mom left the Catholic church when I was an infant because the priest refused to baptize me, declaring me a bastard because my parents had been married in city hall rather than the church. Unfortunately a couple years later, she and my \"new\" dad jumped on the Jesus Freak bandwagon of the late 70s and went off the deep end). My mom's ex-boyfriend was annoyingly very Christian, a young earth creationist raised by missionaries, and it really pissed my mom off when he would debate my Catholic grandmother about the validity of her Christianity and assert her lack of salvation. I do think it's odd that my mom obviously doesn't believe that but continues going to churches that make no secret their disdain for any other interpretations of Christianity, eating up everything else they preach as if it were literal gospel.\n\nShe also has several times made comments like \"They're so nice and they're not even Christians!\" as if it's some wacky incongruity, and conveniently ignoring all the horrible people who loudly profess their Christianity.",

If he was perfect, he wouldn't have doubted God. The other is when the Pharisees turn the temple into a market, and he makes a whip to drive them out. Second, I don't think the Saint are perfect. But they have already reached a very intimate connection with God, so we're asking them to help get our prayers to God. The same with Mary. I have never understood how recognizing someone's achievements is saying they are God",

They only started to split (officially) during those councils where Rome attempted to standardize and agree upon what constituted Christianity and how to practice it to keep warring factions and branching religions from tearing their empire apart.\n\nThere are over 40,000 different Christian denominations total. It's a fucking mess.",

They provide social services where the government fails. I\u2019ve had to send a few legal aid clients (more than 100% below the poverty line) to churches to get help because there was no where else to turn. They were never turned away. Those churches found housing for people. They provided rental assistance. They provided food. \n\nI grew up pretty secular, and my family didn\u2019t do shit for the community. We had no organization or faith practice pushing us to get involved. \n\nWe need institutions to organize us, but that means people have the opportunity to use those institutions for bad. The answer isn\u2019t to destroy the institutions. The answer is to make them transparent and accountable. You can deter wrong doing, and when a human being does inevitably fuck up, there are consequences. \n\nAll institutions, religious and civic, have suffered from old unquestioned hierarchies that prevent any kind of transparency or accountability. Even hierarchy (e.g. teacher and student) is possible as long as there is some kind of accountability and moral code of mutuality. Most institutions seem interested in reform. It is just a slow process.",

There is a reason there have been many reformations against the catholic church, the mist notable being the one that cemented Protestantism as a direction of Christianity with Martin Luther's ninety-five theses.\n\nWhilst there us a lot of confusing and contradictory stuff in the Bible, the stuff that Jesus Christ taught was far from opaque. The whole crux of Christianity is the following of a single god through the teaching of his human son Jesus Christ. So when a denomination of the Christian Church fails to do that very simple mission statement, based on their own holy book that they endorse, I call shenanigans.",

And the same with \"Africans\" (in the term \"African-American\"). Similar things happen for this side of the hemisphere where people commonly say \"North American\" or \"Latin American\", etc. Its utility depends on context, but that's a different matter.\n\nThe reason abbreviating \"United States of America\" to \"America\" is grammatically incorrect is because the \"of\" is used in the English sense of belonging (\"books of the library\"), not of constitution (\"library of books\"). Most other countries of the world are officially named with the \"of\" being used in the latter sense (e.g., \"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\"), but the US uses the former sense. In the former example, abbreviating it to \"library\" is incorrect because you're talking about the books, not where the place where those books are located. All of the names of the countries in this hemisphere could easily be extended with the \"of America\" label in order to make this clear: \"Canada of America\", \"the United Mexican States of America\", etc.\n\nOn a related point, this is why many people make the mistake of conjugating in the plural in cases like saying \"the set of books are great\" when it should be \"the set of books *is* great\" because you're talking about the set, which is singular; the set being made up of books is extra information that is unnecessary for the sentence to be complete.",

Use of the three terms is common in schools, government, and media.

Which is why I just don't get why people seem to be calling people out for calling people from USA Americans like they're wrong. I'm not saying its incorrect for a Brazilian to call themselves American. But American generally refers to people USA colloquially in everyday use when people are talking about where they're from. I just want people to stop acting like they're on some high horse when they point out that's there also continents called America. OK. Well done. It also very commonly means people from the USA, and everyone knows that, people are trying to be a smart arse for no reason. If someone calls people from USA \"American\", they're correct and shouldn't be downvoted or patronised when they do that like the replies that commenter got when asking if he meant Americans.",

The Dutch didn\u2019t colonise a lot, unless a lot of money could be made there. New Amsterdam was a nice trading station, but it also cost a lot of money. And the only trade was for pelts and stuff from the natives. Plus it needed soldiers and supplies. So all and all it wasn\u2019t really something Dutchies wanted to risk ships over to defend. Besides the English were claiming the land all around, and they already took it once before, but it was taken back by the Dutch. Which wasn\u2019t a very lucrative exercise. So Dutchies dropped the ball on garrisoning it properly and the English just kinda took it one day. And then they were like \u201cwe\u2019ll give you lads Suriname and we\u2019ll call it evens stevens\u201d. And the Dutch were like: \u201cyeah ok\u201d.",
