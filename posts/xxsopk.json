The experiences of an Asian person (just using Asian as an example, the same applies to African or Latin Americans) born in Asia are different from the experiences of someone of Asian descent born in foreign places like the US and Europe.\n\nThe US specially has this thing with ancestrality where they make a big fuss about where they are from when they are actually just Americans. You are born in America, you are American. You are born in the UK, you are british. That's it. You don't see this preocupation with ancestrality in places where these actual minorities are from. So people born in the US and Europe that are from any of these minoritites usually hold on so much to their ancestrality as a way to somehow connect to their parents/grandparents culture even though they don't actually experience those in the same way as someone who actually lives in those places. People that actual live in those places don't need to reaffirm at all times that they are from that culture so they are much more easily content in sharing it with others than someone whose whole sense of their culture lies in these few traditions/clothing.\n\nBack to Apu or Speedy Gonzalez, for example. A person from India/Mexico that sees Apu/Speedy might find it funny and appreciate it because they think it's a cool thing that their culture is being represented on a foreign media. While an American that is of descent of any of those cultures might find it offensive because they feel they are being mocked at because that's the only representation they are getting.  An Indian person doesn't care that much about representation on an american media because they already have their own form of representation in Bollywood. While for the American person they need it to feel connected to their ancestrality.\n\nThis youtuber explains a little better at 8:20.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNkZIJkXI6g&t=1079s",

The liberal perspective that we should be cautious not to offend ppl is a well and good attitude to keep in mind and I think we should be respectful of others, but banning speech or characters and limiting what we can do or say lest we offend someone is a step too far imo and it's a slippery slope to censoring anything ppl can be offended by, and 20th history books have plenty of case studies on how bad things can get when we start to censor everything ppl do or say.

They handed down the directive and Cartoon Network (who is Boomerang) fought it, but there was A LOT of internal discussion about the decision.  At the time, the network was being careful to scrutinize the racism in their legacy content. \n\nWhen you are showing content to children, you have to remember they don\u2019t have the context that adult viewers do.  We can understand the conventions that would have a character like the maid in *Tom and Jerry,* etc. \n\nBelieve it or not, at the time, CN really cared about representation and diversity. A lot of networks give lip service, but CN realized they weren\u2019t representing the demographics of their viewers and tried to do a better job. They actually were ahead of trends in this respect.\n\nI think this was an instance of a media company really trying to do the right thing.  WB miscalculated due to bad research. People often virtue signal and say what they think the researchers want to hear, when in reality, Speedy was based on stereotypes, but perhaps not harmfully so. CN had a gut check that the character shouldn\u2019t be censored and they were right.\n\nBeing able to pivot is the important thing.  \n\nThis is the network that gave us Steven Universe, Static Shot, Justice League, Teen Titans and Young Justice.  There was A LOT of internal considerations about kids of color being represented.  Believe it or not, it was not c-suite suits but the creatives at CN and DC really wanting to do right by their fans that moved the needle.\n\nIn the meantime, despite Steven Universe\u2019s success, the networks (Boom, CN and AS) could still do better with female and diversity representation. Especially Adult Swim, which has always had issues with misogyny.\n\nNow with Discovery taking control of WB and CN, the clowns are driving the car, so who knows?",

Dressing up in blackface used to be totally acceptable, but it\u2019s pretty clear that it\u2019s incredibly offensive to enough people that you really shouldn\u2019t do it. Same with putting on an indigenous American headdress like you\u2019re in some 50s cartoon. Also there are plenty of Latin Americans who are offended by the dude dressed up in a poncho and a mustache being a Mexican caricature, but obviously they\u2019re excluded from that clip he circulated. Do we focus on the people who are offended or the people that aren\u2019t? Do we consider *how* offended they are? I agree that cancel culture isn\u2019t really a great social trait, but I also don\u2019t think we should just do whatever we want even if it is offensive to others. There\u2019s a line that\u2019s difficult to draw, and everyone\u2019s line is a little different I\u2019d guess.",

It doesn't affect them so they assume it's an innocent attempt at participating in their culture. \n\nBut being a Mexican-American student surrounded by white kids that don't understand your culture is very different and those kids put up with a lot more abuse in their efforts to fit in with tone-deaf white students.\n\nSo yeah, white people often overreact in cringey and clueless ways, but dressing up as \"a Mexican for Halloween\" is racist and those students in the video have a good reason to feel uncomfortable around a white kid going \"I'm dressed Mexican!

In the video, you can notice the guy only seems to talk to non-Hispanic young people who disapprove but every old Hispanic person he talked to didn't seem to care. Seems quite selective and doesn't really pass the smell test for their \"see Hispanics don't care, the Left are being dumb\" narrative, especially when older generations are less inclined to care about cultural appropriation or racially stereotyping people. That isn't to say that misuse of the term \"cultural appropriation\" isn't a thing or getting offended on someone's behalf happens too often, but maybe citing a very obviously selective video from an intentionally dishonest source isn't great evidence of this.",

The minorities in town will 100% without fail always always always downplay racism that happens openly in public. They\u2019re not idiots, they know that calling it out can lead to retaliation, so they will put up with and laugh along with a lot of stuff that\u2019s not physically violent. \n\nThe last time I ever spoke to my ex-in-laws was at a restaurant one night. There was table of black people celebrating a high school graduation. Festive time. My in-laws made a fuck-ton of off the wall racist comments, including complaining to the waitress (a Hispanic) and using pretty much the entire book of racial epithets.\n\nI called them out on it and their justification was \u201cwe\u2019re just joking, even the waitress thought it was funny!\u201d But like \u2026 you could see that the waitress was wildly uncomfortable but wasn\u2019t going to say anything because she needed their tips.",

They live among Asian people, so harmful stereotypes being promoted don\u2019t necessarily bring violent consequences; other Asian people aren\u2019t going to assault them just for being Asian, eh? So you go to an Asian comic\u2019s show, attended by a principally Asian audience, and you will hear tons of jokes about eating bats and covid, about confusing various other Asians for being \u201cChinese\u201d, and they\u2019ll find this funny. Because to many of them, this isn\u2019t a matter that subjects them to discrimination or physical violence.\n\nBut you tell these same jokes to an Asian-American audience, and you might get a very, very different response. My Chinese-American wife and in-laws are _very_ sensitive to this topic because this stereotype has literally lead to people they know being assaulted while walking down the street, guilty of nothing worse than existing while Asian.\n\nYour line of thinking runs the risk of conflating these two groups as being the same.",

For example taking something from another culture and:\n\n* Transforming it to be suitable to your locale.\n* Improving it.\n* As you said being properly respectful and educational with it's use.\n\nAll whilst giving proper credit and/or being explicit in your non-association with said culture.\n\nAvatar the Last Airbender is cultural appropriation.   \nNew York Pizza is cultural appropriation  \nFireworks are cultural appropriation\n\nWithout cultural appropriation, culture stagnates.",

If you're going to call something *impressively* ignorant, you might want to first make sure you understand what was said. \n\nThey said that nonphysical things like culture cannot be *stolen*, not that they cannot be lost. American Indian cultural erasure was not white people stealing their culture, it was forcing them not to practice their culture (another way of saying that is forcing them to lose their culture.) But white people didn't in turn just claim that American Indian culture was their own culture. To *steal*, you have to have possession of the stolen thing for a time, no?\n\nNow, I disagree that things like culture *cannot ever* be stolen, but struggle to think of an example beyond a hypothetical. It would require one people to remove a culture from another people (prevent the other people from practicing their own culture) *and* use it as their own without giving credit to the originating people. Erasure is absolutely despicable, but being despicable alone does not equate it to stealing.",

That kind of bs is unacceptable, even if you assume that everyone else plays fast and loose with words too. I'm not missing the point you are making, some things that people do with other people's cultures is bad. Which is why I wrote the last part of my comment. But it's not semantics to say that one word obviously does not mean another word, when your entire argument was based on falsely misquoting someone where the difference in meaning between your false quote and what they said is operative. It is pointing out that you strawmanned them. \n\nThere's not anything inherently wrong with a lot of the examples you gave. I will give the positive versions, while recognizing that you mean when they are bad. Sometimes virtue signaling is done in response to actual disrespect; people can have multiple motives simultaneously. Treating others differently based on their culture can be cultural sensitivity, if you understand the culture. Cultures profit off of each other all the time; look at Japanese Jean companies replicating vintage American jeans for profit, for example. As an American, good for them. Downplaying historical events based on someone's culture can absolutely be valid: how much does the historical event affect that person given their culture and cultural history? I'm not about to lecture a Chinese businessman about the history of American Indians while in China. \n\nUsing another's culture for selfish gains is literally what cultural exchange often entails. See the jeans example. Otherwise, Hollywood is no longer allowed to make any movies about any non-Los Angeles cultures, ever. I'd be happy to give more examples, but you get the point.",

Originally it was overwhelmingly credited as being invented by white musicians when the reality is it was lifted directly from black musicians with no credit given to its actual cultural origins. It's not erasing the entirety of that element of the culture, but appropriating it and assigning new ownership. That's overwhelmingly been corrected and anyone looking into the history will undoubtedly stumbled upon that fact fairly quickly, but it's hard to quantify the damage something like that does in the mean time by trying to lessen the impact an individual culture has on the wider culture it is also a part of in a place like the US.\n\nAgain, I honestly don't think appropriation happens all that often in the modern day at the cultural level as it has in the past. It's much more often that we just see nominal cultural exchange that ends up integrating and hybridizing with each other. It's really not something I think most can truly get away with at scale due to the ease of historical information access. I also don't think it inherently benefits anything by trying to change that ownership in most cases in the modern context when we're so used to borrowing from so many cultures at this point where in the past the idea of participating in X culture may have been seen as a negative even if the element itself was enjoyed.",

IE- I come from Germanic people who settled in the Midwest- they have a subset of traditions that are unique. I don't call myself German though. I think it's asinine to. There is also heavy French influence in Louisiana.  America is full of cultural microcosms, more akin to multiple countries in Europe as opposed to one large culture/heritage. \n\nFrom the outside I can see how 4th of July seems to be the only American cultural day which is fucking sad because it's become, at least to many of us, a joke holiday and we enjoy exaggeratedly stereotyping the worst of us to celebrate it.

I then thank every Scottish people for not being offended by me wearing a kilt, otherwise I would have been cancelled several times.",

Based on the fact that 26 guys were in the class and no girls, a lot of dances were out (like English waltz) so we had a traditional Scottish dance (mixed up with some popular dances like pulp fiction and stuff) and  we were doing this in kilt and another clothes with tartan pattern.

I always wanted to wear the saris and was one of the few to do so, I would have it on the whole day while working with the children and they fucking loved it, would come and fix it up if they noticed parts slipping throughout the work day. \n\nOne of the women whose baby shower I was invited to asked me to please wear a sari because of it, she had family members visiting from India and would always reminisce even years on \u201cmy mum still talks about you, \u2018the nice girl looking beautiful in the sari\u2019 you know\u201c.",

In this case, she *was* Mexican-American, but it's still incredibly arrogant and wrong to tell someone they're wrong for feeling a way she didn't agree with, about his *own* fucking culture.\n  \nI definitely wasn't speaking *for* him, because he did a damn great job of explaining his feelings on it, but the hypocrisy of telling someone they're an idiot for disagreeing with you, when their feelings are every bit as valid (and maybe *more* so), is fucking *wrong* and shitty and bigoted.",

Almost all of the characters depicted in it were white, though, because of the *dramatis personae* the creators had available to work with. Criticizing it for the characters it depicts ignores the people \"behind the camera\" (as it were). Which brings up your other excellent point:\n\n> If you want to help marginalized people, hire them and pay them the same wages you pay white people.\n\nWhen MAD Magazine (while I'm thinking about comics and related media) hired Sergio Aragon\u00e9s, they didn't hire him as some sort of diversity human resources thing. That was years before that sort of thing even existed. They hired him because he was simply a brilliant cartoonist, and they'd have been stupid to ignore his massive talent.",

People overdo it all the time. Context is important and so is being balanced; not going too far in any one direction. \n\nI attribute it to a lack of critical thinking being appropriately taught throughout our formative school years.

I could be truly offended by the idea of someone dressing up as a skimpy nurse and making innuendo nurse jokes. That could be seen as mocking IMHO. \n\nHeck maybe I'm Celtic and I take offense to the idea that the Pope stole halloween into All Saints and doubly offended that now all these foreigners are turning my pagan cultural traditions into a festival of pumpkins, candy and skimpy outfits. \n\n\nNot saying 'sexy indian' doesn't feel wrong. Personally I'm kinda prudish and not a big fan of all the skimpy halloween costumes however offensive they are. If anything I'd say all of it feels wrong, but I'm not about to lose any sleep over how other people choose to dress least of all for a festivity.",

Dirndls, while starting as working outfits, eventually became vogue as festival getup in the 30s via a \"[trashy operetta](https://www.oktoberfest.de/en/traditional-fashion/the-dirndl-how-it-became-a-hot-fashion-accessory/amp)\", in a move I'm going to equate to \"flannel becoming a regular thing\" or \"jeans being considered decent and not manual labor clothes\". Sexy maids, that's just a power dynamic fantasy. \"Lacy outfit, and their job is to serve\"? That porno basically writes itself.\n\nLeprechauns, though. I have literally zero idea what to make of that one. On the one side, does anyone care? On the other, is the reason no one cares because of the English wiping Irish culture off the map? I'll let someone else figure it out. Incidentally, this wraps around to the point about Christianity eradicating pagan religions. Yes, it's okay to be upset your culture was erased, and then some dipshit walks around clowning on it. Why the fuck wouldn't it be?\n\nAnd professions? Well, seeing as my two professions get tend lampooned either as [this](https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/4.jpg_SKPCj7M.jpg/BROK/resize/1200x1200%3E/format/jpg/quality/70/4.jpg_SKPCj7M.jpg) \nor as [this](https://costispapatheodorou.art/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Soupla-Greta-40x30cm-Shush.jpg), it sucks and I know it. But, well, *I chose these things.* No one *made me* be an environmental researcher, I *did that* of my *own free will.* I also *chose* to be a neckbeard software guy. But you know what I *didn't* choose? I *didn't* choose to be *queer as absolute fuck.* Just how the hypothetical Celtic person *didn't choose* that. So when you're mocking things that people chose to do, it's kinda fair game. When you're mocking things that people were born into, you're being an ass.\n\nExample: calling me a tree-hugging hippy who needs to get a real job. Sure. I'll allow it. My fault I'm in this predicament. Calling me a bunch of slurs for my sexuality? No, that's not okay. That's a brickin'.",

A lot of our ancestors came over here because they were fleeing tough times in their original countries, but they kept their original cultures when they came here because they were proud of it, and passed it down to their kids and grandkids and so on.\n  \nLike, I'm an American of Polish descent. My last name is tied to a small, rural village over there in Southwest Poland. My great-grandparents came here between 1890 and 1915. My grandma was born here, the only one of her siblings to be so, but she had a Polish accent her whole life, because she grew up speaking it first, then English as a second language. Same with my grandpa. My parents, when they first moved into the Buffalo suburb I grew up in, most of our neighbors at that time spoke Polish first, English second. Buffalo has the world's biggest Dyngus Day celebration outside of Poland itself, because *so* many Polish people came here and kept strong ties to their original culture. And don't get me wrong, my family have all been proud as hell to be Americans, consider ourselves Americans first, but they also wanted us to remember where we came from, because they were proud of that, too.\n  \nEdit: Don't get me wrong, I'm prouder of coming from a family of awesome, loving people who are all good, kind, decent and hardworking people. I miss my grandma more because she was the sweetest, nicest woman alive. She made the best goddamn pies and desserts and food, and all she did was spread cheer and love to us all. My grandpa was a little gruff, but not mean, just not used to being open about his feelings. But he was a great guy from a farming background, fought the Nazis in WWII for the US as a combat engineer in the 82nd, and worked hard to make sure his kids and grandkids had better and more opportunities than he did, growing up.",

My Polish-American ancestry's more relevant since we know it better. I know where all of my great-grandparents on that side originated from in Poland, that some came into the US through Boston and the others through Ellis Island, and they kept up the memories and heritage and made sure their kids, and then us, knew where we came from. I'm still very much American, but I do love the old traditions my family passed down that they wanted to keep alive, too. \n  \nSo yeah, I guess you're right. My own ties are stronger *because* it was still recent, but also because my family kept those aspects of their heritage and culture alive for us, despite considering themselves proud Americans first.",

They didn't even give her a chance to correct, guilty by ignorance. I don't see a problem if they sourced the fabric from those cultures,  providing income for their designs. But mainly it's people using fabric designs from other cultures in their personal sews. It's appreciating the artistic designs that are original to somewhere else. God forbid someone uses an African tribal design on their shirt because it's beautiful and aren't obviously from there...doxxing deserved according to the policing forces. \n\nI thought we were supposed to be a melting pot.

In no way were the drow in D&D an attempt to mock black people or even remotely stated as such, but as you've stated, some people thought \"It might be blackface,\" and raised a stink about it, similar to the self-appointed culture guardian in OP's pic.

Damn near every depiction of Dark Elves, including Tolkien's himself, are based off the Norse  mythology's D\u00f6kk\u00e1lfar/Svart\u00e1lfar and Lj\u00f3s\u00e1lfar. Drow just go off the Svart\u00e1lfar's most surface description as literally black elves, rather than the possibilites that dark elves and black elves were distinct entities, that dark elves weren't black-skinned like black elves, or that both terms are actually just referring to dwarves.\n\nAll in all, I somehow doubt that any of the storytellers of Norse mythos were making some kind of racist statement about black people based on colonial tropes when they likely had little to no contact with Subsaharan Africans and the English didn't even control the British Isles yet, let alone colonized half the world. Hell, speaking of Tolkien as a racist, his work went with the interpretation that dark elves aren't even actually dark, but pale when he created the Moriquendi.",

In fact, he was a friggin hero. As were my favourite cricket all rounders if the time, Imran Khan and Kapil Dev - and Richard Hadlee, who was about as white as you can get.\n\nMy point is... I just thought they were pointing out he had a black face. Which he did. I didn't think it was bad, and had no idea what racism was.\n\n30 years Later, Kamahl said he felt insulted. \n\nFair call! \n\nBut, I will say...  As an 8 year old, I saw no disrespect, and had no issue with it: in fact I loved the songs he did. He just had a black face... And he was up there with Slim Dusty.",

BUT we also have to teach them the beauty in everyone.\n\n When a child asks why someone is different in public most parents shut them down out of embarrassment.  These moments should be used for teaching. I'm trying hard. My six year old recently saw her first really dark skinned poc. We live in the north so not a hugely diverse. The woman she was referring to is a gorgeous very dark skinned momma who sells handmade skin products locally. She glows healthy. Anyways,  my daughter said right in front of the woman,  \"wow, mommy\n, is she actually black?\"  Our neighbors are poc but are all on the lighter end. This allowed me to explain there are many regions/ countries that humans originate from and some people naturally have darker skin than others. Black doesn't mean literally but many shades of darker skin. She had recently learned similar when she found out her light dominant best friend is native, that not all their skin is the same. My daughter then commented on how pretty she was and we proceeded to look for  different shades of all the people around us. When we pay attention the variety and spectrum of all our skin is rather fascinating.",

By definition, culture has nothing to do with race. Culture is, \"The arts, beliefs, customs, institutions, and other products of human work and thought considered as a unit, especially with regard to a particular time or social group.\" There may be a predominant race in a culture but there is nothing in culture that mandates specific racial inclusion. For example, people like Eminem. White people that grew up participating in the arts, beliefs, and customs of predominantly Black areas. Or just look at Africa. Black Africans are not one homogenous group. There are countless ethnic groups within Africa and within individual countries in Africa and they all have their own distinct cultures. there is not one \"African Culture\" that they they all follow because they are Black. Culture is going to be things like arts, cuisine, fashion, etc., so it's the things they do and make together as a group that makes the culture. Culture is fluid and dynamic. It changes over time. Race does not. People are who they are and they learn the culture of the environment they grew up in regardless of race. \n\nSo, how does painting your face black show appreciation for Black culture if race isn't a requirement and even within Black people, there are vastly different cultures? It doesn't. It just makes a caricature.",

In fact, it's a big chunk of why he was viewed as such a threat to modest society while having a big African-American fandom in the early days of his career. \n\nSo why is it cultural appropriation? Because Elvis Presley is the \"King of Rock n Roll\" and is the best-selling solo artist of all time. Despite performing constantly with black artists and singers, and acknowledging he wasn't as talented as some of the black artists he looked up to, not a single one of them reached the heights of a white man doing the same exact style of music. Elvis said it himself; \"Rock 'n' roll has been around for many years. It used to be called rhythm and blues.\"\n\n> \"The colored folks been singing it and playing it just like I\u2019m doin' now, man, for more years than I know. They played it like that in their shanties and in their juke joints and nobody paid it no mind 'til I goosed it up. I got it from them. Down in Tupelo, Mississippi, I used to hear old Arthur Crudup bang his box the way I do now and I said if I ever got to a place I could feel all old Arthur felt, I'd be a music man like nobody ever saw.\"\n\nNow? Once you get past Elvis, rock is now viewed as a purely white genre that sells like mad for white artists. Shoot forward a bit, you now have The Rolling Stones, The Yardbirds, and The Animals getting famous off the blues rock sound (stemming from the \"Chicago blues\") and what is their fame lumped under? \"The British Invasion\". Mind you, this influence was prominent enough they literally toured with the blues artists they came from from during their early days, yet how many people are gonna recognize the names and impact of people like Sonny Boy Williamson II, Bo Diddley, Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, Willie Dixon, Jimmy Reed, Skip James, Howlin' Wolf etc. versus The Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Eric Clapton and Cream, CCR, The Doors, etc? Especially abroad.\n\nThe absolute goddamned foundation of the genre, and continuing influences/active performers during the 50s-80s, yet the only black rock artists your average rock fan can name are likely just Prince, Jimi Hendrix, and Chuck Berry if you're lucky. This is what cultural appropriation looks like on a seismic cultural level, where an art form springs up and creates an industry in the billions of dollars for a music genre society didn't give a shit about or even derided until white artists started playing it, while all those black artists are consigned to the history books.\n\n**TL;DR Rock music is the titular example of CA for good reason. The only difference between then and now is the ones who are actually affected have more of a voice to prevent being neglected by the cultural hegemony again.**",

There's a big difference between doing a Jesus or Pope dress up hour, and anti Catholic screeds. And then there are the people who can't separate good faith criticism or, you know, creativity (see: Scorcesi) from sectarian attacks. Those people cross a line into wanting the state to censor other's speech so they never have to feel uncomfortable, and that's not cool. We have separation of church and state for a reason. Pro-tip: it protects Catholics, not exactly the most popular religion around here when the country was founded.\n\nWhen I first encountered Christian symbolism in Japanese media honestly it was a bit of an uncomfortable feeling. It's weird to see your own culture reflected back at you through a cracked mirror. Especially that which is considered sacred. But in the end, Japanese people aren't in a position of power to define Christianity or how it's portrayed. So instead I wish it with curiosity instead of threat.\n\nFor minority groups in the US versus the majority, the power differential can be quite different.\n\nLet's take a less inflammatory example. Americans have a lot of stereotypes if Irish being drunken partiers. Because Irish Americans aren't barred from anything due to their heritage nowadays, the community has embraced these stereotypes in a joking manner. However there was an incident where this stuff was aired on Irish television after a tragedy in California and Irish media was very outraged.

There\u2019s practice and policy behind wearing the feathers that are steeped in religion and culture, that many natives aren\u2019t even allowed to wear eagle feathers.\n\nIf you just find a feather on the ground and put it in your hair, not imitating natives but because you think it\u2019s a pretty feather or something, I doubt many natives would care at all. Maybe they\u2019d say something if it was an eagle feather or something, but those are federally illegal to collect in America anyways (unless you\u2019re native)",

ESPECIALLY if you don\u2019t live in America. Nobody will ever say anything to you. Maybe in America, a native may say something to you depending on what type of feather you have. Especially considering it\u2019s **federally illegal** for any non native (hmmmm wonder why that may be?) to collect bald eagle feathers.\n\nBUT if you wore a full in eagle feather headdress, in an attempt to imitate a native person, that is seen as extremely disrespectful and like, the definition of cultural appropriation.\n\nInstead of understanding this point, you got weirdly emotional and launched into a racist, ignorant diatribe.",

So I would argue that wearing native american clothes for a costume party is not cultural appropriation because it doesn't imply in any way that it's your own culture's thing. In fact I would argue that it's the opposite because part of the whole thing of costume parties is to be something else so in a way it's more like a celebration of the culture from which the clothes come from.\n\nReal cultural appropriation would be to say that those are clothes that are just kinda part of the culture of all Americans, completely ignoring or even erasing the fact that it's specifically a native american thing. It's like the \"You made this? I made this.\" meme but in culture form.",

Are you then also claiming a Portugese and a Fin share the same culture because they have roughly the same skin tone?

Firstly, and most importantly, we never get to \u2018person still continuing\u2019 part, it becomes a massive pile on at the very sign of alleged \u2018cultural appropriation\u2019. Secondly, it also depends on something being cultural appropriation in the first place, which wearing a sodding dress just because you think it is pretty is not automatically just because it comes from a different culture. And that\u2019s the huge difference between you and me. I believe you can wear clothing from another culture without begging for approval from that culture, hence me saying that \u2018doing it in a mocking way\u2019 is that deciding factor.\n\nAnd as I said elsewhere, go to China. Wear a qipao. Be amazed by no one caring. This is all about white people being offended by proxy and <ethnic group>-Americans seeking to gatekeep a culture they are very far removed from as they are struggling with their loss of identity.",

Hooked cross. Call it that. How dare you call a sign of evil the Swastika. \n\nSwastika is not an English or European word. Hakenkreuz is. \n\nIt means Su Asthi or Good Fortune mark. It means nothing in German or English. \n\nChange it, and if whoever says they' won't is  just a fucking pig. The English took too much from India, we won't let them pervert our, and Asian civilizational symbols with your bullshit.\n\nPeople can no longer divert European origin things and put the negative blame on the Indic and Buddhist civilizations.\n\nYou don't get to use the word, not in this context. We will see to it.\n\nSwastika is also a common female name. People name their children this. The name will be the same in english. \n\nId like to see some Englishman name their child Swastika. They have No ownership of this word, and in this case it is clear cultural appropriation of the most horrendous kind.\n\nhttps://www.babycenter.com/baby-names/details/swastika-135175#:~:text=What%20does%20Swastika%20mean%3F,Hinduism%2C%20Buddhism%2C%20and%20Jainism.\n\nYou want to read more on it you can read here.\nhttps://cohna.org/swastika-is-not-hakenkreuz/\n\nFrom the coalition of Hindus in North America. \nThe Nazi Hakenkreuz is not the Indic Swastika and it should not be called that.",

Like when a white girl sports dreadlocks and is being harassed for it.\n\nAnd I specifically wrote \"as it is wielded\" because as alredy established, the term \"cultural appropriation\" should indeed be just a neutral term describing a cultural phenomenon without any valuation implied.

And I don't keep a folder on stupid people, so I don't have examples to show you at hand. All I know is people like from the OP show up sometimes. We have this thread right? That's one. The only other one I remember is the one about celebrating lunar new year. To have more examples I would have to be the reactionary you assumed I am, but I'm not.",

My response is, \"ah well you can get off the internet  and stop speaking English then because my country/race invented that and I'm deeply offended that you're using it\". I just meet their insane arguments with other insane nonsense arguments. Some of the comments here say it's only when you're doing it to be stereotypical intentionally to be offensive which is totally wrong yes, but that's not what \"cultural appropriation\" seems to mean or at least what it is weaponised to be used as, any time I've seen it online to mean \"you're doing something or wearing something or enjoying something from a culture that is not yours and that is offensive\" but if you're not Chinese and you wear a Chinese traditional dress because you appreciate it and think it's beautiful, how that's offensive to anyone (and it's definitely offensive to some people) on any level absolutely baffles me, when I went to NZ the M\u0101ori lads we met wanted all the tourists in their traditional dress and showed us how to do a form of haka and it was this nice moment of cultural RESPECT and appreciation, seems like it's being offended on other people's behalf, that or there's a chip on their shoulder so gigantic they can barely walk in a straight line.",

He even expressed that he's offended on my behalf.\n\nBelly dancing is Egyptian. I'm Tunisian. Sure, Egyptians and Tunisians can be lumped in together since we're north Africans but I wasn't offended. If anything I was a little tickled by the choice of music (they played remixes of Egyptian love songs from like the 70s and back that don't really match the vibe) And I definetly had some critiques to actual dancing chops of the dancer (she really had little elasticity if that's the word that a belly dancer should have). \n\nBut yeah, that was a weird experience lol.",

A mishmash of vaguely Native American things, some of which have ceremonial or spiritual significance, worn by a person who understands nothing about the culture. Look at the old Aladdin movie. It's a mix of Indian and Arabian stuff, full of offensive historical inaccuracies (e.g. cutting someone's hand off for theft, without an organized trial and formal sentencing), meant to feel exotic.\n\nThere are options between appreciating something and directly insulting something. Imagine if you'd gone to New Zealand dressed in half-assed vaguely Maori dress and tried doing a haka where you just beat your chest and screamed like an idiot. Do you think they'd care if you thought it was cool and weren't actually trying to insult them?",

                  "text": "> Out of curiosity, why did you go with Japanese tats?\n\nA kinda mix of reasons, to be honest.  At first, I wasn't the biggest fan of the traditional Japanese style.  But as I got more and more exposure, something about the art style started resonating with me.  It's simple, compared to something like photo-realism, but there's something that started to speak to me... beauty through simplicity.  Things do not have to be complicated or saturated with detail to be nice.\n\nThe flatter look, the simple palettes, telling more with less.  I dunno.  It just spoke to me.\n\nThen I started researching more on the history of Japanese tattoos, the dichotomy between this adornment of the body, but the need (and desire) to hide it, to keep it to yourself, both due to the stigma in the culture, but also the belief that the tattoos are for the self.  That you can have an entire body suit decorated, but hidden with clothes, and no one ever knows.  That also spoke to me.  I work in a professional environment and wear sleeves, and no one ever even knows.  And it's a fun sort of secret.\n\nThis research also led me into some interesting discoveries as far as Japanese philosophy and world views, religion, mythology, etc.  I wouldn't call myself a Japanophile in the sense that I worship their culture, but I've found they have a refreshing look at things that my western brain never considered, and while I don't agree with everything I read, it has given me some perspective and new ways of looking at the world.\n\nSo anyway, way more than you wanted to know, I'm sure, but there you go.  Thank you for attending my Ted Talk. :)",

When we see it today, we think of it as traditional Chinese clothing, but it's quite the opposite. When it first was popularized in Chinese culture, it was a statement AGAINST traditional women's clothing. It incorporated designs and materials that were part of traditional Chinese clothing, but the cut and fit of it was inspired by the clothes worn by upper class Western women. It was a fashion statement highlighting modernity and cosmopolitan ambitions at a time when China was undergoing seismic changes in its culture, economy, and government. Prior to the QiPao, traditional Chinese woman's clothing was lose and flowing, not tight and form fitting. Fast forward 100 years, and if a Western girl is seen wearing a QiPao, the culture SWAT team starts shooting and showing off their own ignorance, even though that dress is based on the dresses worn by flappers in the 1920s. The QiPao was Chinese \"appropriation\" of Western fashion that was executed so well that it became considered traditional Chinese fashion in a very short time, when in reality it is a perfect example of the beauty that can be created from combining cultures. \n\nIn my mind 95% of accusations of cultural appropriation are absolutely bullshit and amount to cultural segregation, which  is the complete opposite of what is helpful to fostering cultural exchange and togetherness. I don't let segregationists affect my thoughts and actions. If they want to segregate culture and race, they're welcome to do that in their lives, but the irony is that they aren't much better than the segregationist of the past, despite today's segregationists claiming a progressive motive for their regressive beliefs.",

I actually think that there\u2019s nothing wrong with someone outside of Han Chinese culture trying hanfu, because it\u2019s something that I think is beautiful and I want more people to appreciate. There\u2019s definitely a level of cultural and historical awareness you should have, but if you talk to people who understand how it works, it\u2019s something that I honestly don\u2019t think is a big deal. Hanfu culture nowadays is less like ceremonial or sacred garb and more like a Renaissance Fair, since those are historical outfits. The implications are slightly different but you don\u2019t see politicians or businesspeople wearing Hanfu, you see costumers. \n\nThis kind of reminds me of how people on Twitter cyberbullied a random girl on Twitter because Jeremy Lin got butthurt for no reason and then people who are actually from China posted the same image on social media saying \u201cWesterners think that Chinese culture is beautiful and like to wear Chinese dresses\u201d lmao",

Virtue-signalling white people aside, I guess the opinions of Asian-Americans just don't matter? \n\nIf we (Asian-Americans) call out cultural appropriation, it's not out of a desire to gatekeep culture - goodness knows we get enough of that directed at us by Asians from Asia. It's about calling out hypocrisy.\n\nPeople who laugh at racist jokes and make ignorant comments, but then turn around and gush about anime and kpop - they like Asian culture, but not the people. Suddenly the foods we were once made fun of for eating become trendy. Living in the US, you learn to just deal with constant othering as a fact of life. That's nothing new.\n\nThe real frustrating part is when Asian people from Asia (or recent 1st gen Asian immigrants), ignorant of the issues that Asian-Americans face, say \"idk what the big deal is, I'm happy to share my culture,\" which is tangential to the issue at hand. And internet people are always happy to use that to sweep our objections under the rug.\n\nEdit: sp",

Yes, Americans have been known to be quite rude to Asians in the past, but in the past 30 years, Americans have really started to appreciate Asians and Asian culture. No, that doesn't erase the pain you experienced, but getting angry at Americans for finally appreciating Asian culture is only going to hinder the progress that's being made.\n\nKids these days are growing up with Anime on Netflix, and with Disney movies that celebrate every culture. A lot of these kids really appreciate these cultures and fully accept immigrants and descendants from these other nations. If your opinion on this is to call these kids out for \"cultural appropriation\" and to prevent them from getting immersed in your culture, then you have a problem. We're finally making progress here. Yes, \"suddenly the foods you were once made fun of for eating are becoming trendy.\" So let it happen. Be trendy. Be cool. Let Americans celebrate you. \n\nJust imagine if Black people did this. \"*White people used to keep us in chains and whip us, but now they want to listen to our Jazz music. Fuck them!\"*\n\nBlack people gained white allies by *inviting* them into their culture, not by keeping them out.",

There are records of people in what we today call Greece wearing dreads 1,000 BCE. So how do I credit that? And how do we know those people didn\u2019t appropriate it from some other culture? And how do we know that culture didn\u2019t appropriate it from a previous culture? \n\nAnd how do you credit that? Lets say dreads were invented in culture Y what should I do then? Say it every time I meet people? And what about the people from culture Y that hated dreads? Aren\u2019t they also part of culture Y? Isn\u2019t it unfair to claim to talk for them as if everybody from a culture is some kind of stereotype? \n\nAlso culture for a large part is things we do that we don\u2019t know why we do them. When you grew up I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t get an in depth lecture from your parents about the history of eating with knife and fork before eating your first meal with utensils. You are just born into it and replicate behavior you see around you with zero knowledge about the history or meaning behind those behaviors and repeat it so often that it becomes fully engrained in your perception of reality\n\nLike I\u2019m sure you lived a long time before realizing that jeans aren\u2019t what everybody wears and are actually a signifier of your culture. You grow up in an environment where literally everybody wears jeans, it is just normal you never question it. \nBut go to Indonesia and it is completely normal for men to wear skirts and dresses. \n\nWhen they wear jeans does that feel to you like they are \u201ctaking\u201d something from you? Most likely not, it actually feels normal, why wouldn\u2019t you want to wear jeans, they look good and feel good.",

It makes some degree of sense in the context of, for example, \"Indian reservations\" in the US, where they were forcefully relocated and segregated, and despite their supposed \"autonomy\", their \"overlords\" still fuck them over at any chance they get, honestly to this day. You can understand why they might be less than ecstatic some white person decides to use their cultural tropes -- in their eyes, here they go stealing their shit *again*. \n\nNow, just because someone feels bad about something doesn't necessarily mean they get to stop you from doing it... but you can at least understand why they might feel that way.\n\nSo, Americans (essentially the only people who care about any of this) might at least be marginally warranted in being the way they are. However, when you go on the internet, which is inherently a global place, it really stops making any sense to conceptualize cultural \"ownership\" in this way. At *best*, backlash against \"cultural appropriation\" is a borderline understandable, but ultimately undesirable, way to \"fight back\" within the context of a racially divided society that struggles with race-based oppression and racism. At worst, it's just straight up regular racism. \n\nI think any non-racist will agree that in an *ideal world*, everyone freely enjoying everyone else's culture and ideas can only be a good thing, and is surely overwhelmingly more likely to reduce racism over time than to increase it. There better be a really good reason to forcefully try to prevent that from happening... and usually, there isn't.",

          "text": "\"Cultural appropriation\" is a very conservative idea.\nFirst of all, it raises the moral value of traditional culture, as if it's something that should tell you how to live or play a significant part in your social life, and not just serve a recreational and educational purpose. Traditional culture has no bigger part in modern life than any other kind of culture. It also must be very humiliating when a foreigner says your kind should be preserved and guarded like you're some kind of animal going extinct.\nSecond of all, your origin, nationality, race should not tell you what culture or cultures you can associate with. You are a human and are free to access and enjoy any culture in any way or form. Exercising a culture in a disrespectful way is only a crime when it explicitly and maliciously targets a person of a certain nationality in attempt to humiliate them. We protect people, not their activities. In other cases, people do have their right to be stupid. Address their attitude and their judgement and not their origin.\nThird of all, culture isn't owned or defined by anybody, it is not a possession or a contract. There can't be any allowance or prohibition when it comes to culture. It's up to people to study and practice it freely. There aren't right ways to practice a culture (despite everyone being able to hold their, perhaps reasonable, opinions on it), only ways that stood the test of time. Because culture doesn't belong, but can only be associated with.\nNow, all of that is said regarding traditional or historical culture, not race or nationality or ethnicity. Oftentimes people bring up cultural appropriation when the case disputed is plain racism or nationalism, not disrespect of culture.",

Its just like the toner ran out when I was created. I'll get shit from people telling me I shouldnt appropriate stuff from Chinese culture, and when I tell them I'm 100% Chinese, they tell me I shouldn't use anything obviously from Chinese culture because I don't look Chinese enough!\n\n Back when I last had coworkers, we were talking about weddings and I mentioned my red dress and tea ceremony, and pulled up some photos on my phone. One of the women made a face because American brides are supposed to wear white and that red was for Asians. Our other coworker and I busted out laughing, thinking she was making a joke. She then got mad that we were laughing at her. We had to carefully explain that I'm as Chinese as one could possibly be, and that I married a 100% Chinese man too, and that wearing white is for funerals. Her argument was that I didn't look very Chinese, because I dont tan and I dye my hair blonde. We had to point out that she dyed her hair auburn when she has dark brown hair. She got flustered because people can have red hair naturally, she just liked it. I had to tell her  \"yeah, same. Some Chinese people have hair that isn't black, so they like to dye their hair another color too,\" it's one of the stupidest conversations I ever had.",

On the other hand, I have other Asian born friends that are into it. I even remember some Asian kids in grade school practicing writing that style because they thought it was cool. If I saw your cookbook with the Asian style font, I maaaaaybye might roll my eyes on the inside. But I wouldn't be offended. Most likely I wouldn't think more than 5 seconds about it because I have other more important things to be upset about, and currently there are plenty more upsetting things in the world than Asian style fonts.",

However, it's very very common to cut corners and remove important ingredients when cooking outside the original culture of the food.\n\nFor example, no one would dream of serving Pho in Vietnam without mint and other greens on the side. But in so many Vietnamese restaurants outside Vietnam they cut that out and you have to ask for it. Often they'll dodge and/or just say it's not available.  Maybe mint is expensive? But interpreted negatively they are useing your ignorance of what a dish should be as a way to eliminate some hard-to-source or expensive ingredients. And the kicker, often they'll serve it properly if they see you are from the same culture! Which can be extra frustrating. \n\nWith that said, I'm not saying I wouldn't do the same if I was running a restaurant and it's definitely not something you should ever go full Karen over.",

Actual cultural appropriation has a lot to do with historical context and it isn't just wearing the clothes of another culture. It's about not giving credit to the culture that is the origin of certain things like fashion or music, profiting off of another culture/using it for one's own gain, and generally just not treating culture with respect. You can immerse yourself in a different culture but still be respectful about the history behind it and the people who are a part of said culture.\n\nAn example of actual cultural appropriation:\n\nBlack musicians have helped shape American music throughout history, but often the higher ups or the general public would prefer to hear \"black sound\" from white musicians. There's a lot of complexity to it but black people ended up (and still sometimes end up) not getting credit or notoriety for the things that they originally created. If you're interested I highly recommend reading about the roots of black music and history about how it's developed over time.\n\n[here's an article from the Smithsonian to get you started](https://www.si.edu/spotlight/african-american-music/roots-of-african-american-music)",

Another one that comes up often in music: recording an ancestral ritual chant from a tribe on the African continent and using it on an EDM track. Often there are only one or two people *in the tribe* who are allowed to perform those chants. Deciding to be the arbiter of their culture and putting it on a dance track is just extremely disrespectful and unkind.\n\nIn more subtle cases, it can get hard to define, which is what leads to internet drama of the sort in this post. Somebody, usually a pedant of some sort like the accuser in the DM, tries to feel important by enforcing a rule they've simplified in their head to \"don't take anything from other cultures\". Then a bunch of folks pile on with responses that follow typical anti-woke outrage logic, often following the script of \"I wore X and XX culture loved it!\" or \"my XX friend said this is bullshit\".\n\nIgnoring the ridiculous turn that the streamer was Chinese in this case, it would be right to ask, \"hey is it ok that you're wearing that?\" A person *should* ask that, and folks should ask themselves. The answer might be, yes, it's ok, but it's worth asking. Asking is a way to be careful with a culture that isn't one's own-- not for fear of getting cancelled, not for fear of the woke police, not because people from that culture have zero sense of fun, but because cultural exchange can be complex and there aren't easy rules to follow like \"don't wear XX dresses if you're white\" or \"if my friend says it's ok, then it's ok\". Therefore it's important to care for the other culture, and care about context, and make a decision from that stance.",

Exploitation, lack of recognition as equal citizens (or human beings for many) was rampant. Living in America as a black person had significant ramifications for your personal life, health and safety. \nAnd then assume white people start taking parts of your culture and making profits with it, while you\u2019re still unable to vote, attend the same school as white kids. Your culture is being taken advantage of and there\u2019s nothing you could do about it. Which happened with music, arts etc. \n\nNow that\u2019s obviously a very extreme example. \n\nAnother thing, Sinti and Roma have historically been prosecuted and discriminated against heavily in Europe, going as far as being put into concentration camps during the Nazi Regime. Now imagine those same Nazis then taking parts of gypsy culture for their own personal enjoyment and profiting of it. \n\n\nNow, is wearing a traditional dress cultural appropriation? Most likely not. In some cases the line can be quite fine. But if you\u2019re not gaining any sort of exploitative advantage from wearing a dress, it\u2019s most likely more than fine. Now if you do it in an insulting, offensive way, that\u2019s just racism then.",

I\u2019m pretty certain that is directed specifically at white Americans, though I\u2019ve always considered ANYONE white of complexion to be \u201cwhite\u201d.\n\nAnywho, this shit feels more like an attempt to keep things as segregated as possible for the species by promoting cultural groups from intermingling with one another like this. It\u2019s always in reference to the shared, collective cultural memory associated to these groups that cultural appropriation is called upon and is therefore needing protection, but to me this seems ignorant and heavily relies on physical appearance.\n\nWhat about the black boy born in a Chinese providence and grew up there? Is he appropriating the only culture he\u2019s ever known? \n\nOr the white girl growing up in the ghettos of Chicago and learning the mixed black/Latino/polock culture while dreaming of something more? Is she a poser as a result, even if she\u2019s treated the same by her white peers? \n\nIt\u2019s fucking idiotic and overly sympathetic to a natural mixing of the species.",

No culture is \"safe\" from this. It's not racism whatsoever, it's lighthearted and cute. \n\nBlackface on the other hand os straight up mockery over someone's physical appearance as a human, that's messed up. \n\nBut a sombrero, a chinese dress? What about dressing up as a ninja, with zero historical correctness in Japan or elsewhere. Dressing up as knights or as other things. Historically correct isn't necessary when it's done for the purpose of fun. \n\nThe racist thing is when you make fun and actually believe in stereotypes applying to everyone from a certain culture, but at that point you're also stupid. \n\nPeople have to learn how to separate fiction from reality and not be offered when fiction doesn't mirror reality. Everyone here learns in school that vikings didn't wear horned helmets. Education is important, but fun and fiction has a place, otherwise we wouldn't have dragons and other fun myths or cultural mashups in fictional worlds if everything has to be culturally and historically correct. \n\n\nI love the characters of Street Fighter for example, they represent a fictional view of a certain stereotype from each culture.

So: it's possible for cultural appropriation to be an operative concept in the case of Native Americans or African Americans in the US, or Irish in Great Britain, or Aborigines in Australia... the point is that disenfranchised people are continuing to be disenfranchised in a slightly subtler way.\n\nStereotyping is usually a key indicator cultural appropriation is underway because it's intrisically dehumanizing.\n\nFinally, It follows a member of a dominant culture can't really be subject to cultural appropriation.  At that point, it is just simple cultural dissemination, a natural cultural evolutionary process.",

And indeed, Chinese people tend to think it's really cool when other people wear things from their culture. \n\nBut, generally speaking, Westerners have not dominated Chinese people for at least 150 years. The Chinese clothes that some people wear are \"fusion fashion\", products of Western and Chinese co-mingalling of fashion trends (and are arguably related to Chinese appropriation of marganilized ethnic minorities who they hated). There is no religious signifigance to that. There has been no attempt by foreigners to eradicate their culture.  \n\nUnlike with black people of the United States.",

The backlash created by these self righteous lunatics is actively harming the people they claim to defend. \n\nFinally, personally as a Scottish person - you can wear a kilt respectfully, we love seeing folk from other cultures sharing ours, if anything we insist on it if you\u2019re in the country, and there\u2019s nothing better than a cultural mash up - like lads with a turban with a full wedding kilt on, for example.

If somebody is wearing a dress or a hairstyle or doing something from 'another culture', it's because they really like it and they appreciate it and they want to be a part of it.\n\nThey want to share that commonality of interest with another culture to become closer to it. To celebrate it.  They're not trying to assume the culture as their own and claim that they own it or that they invented this. (Hailye Bieber aside)  Celebrities who do this as well, yes they might make some money off it.  Because they're celebrities.  But they make money from just breathing and pooping and farting too, so we can't blame them for this. \n\nBut oftentimes they are expressing or wearing a style that they're interested in or they're trying to be a part of as a community and it brings people together. Go to any other country in the world and if somebody's trying to be a part of their culture by assimilating, the people see this is thoughtful and they're more appreciative of the gesture. Never are they going to say you can't wear braids, you're not black. \n\nIt raises more awareness towards a new culture that maybe people weren't aware of when celebrities do this as well.   It's not stealing, it's an expression of admiration or maybe raising awareness.  \n\nWe are all apart of this planet.  Together. We should be focused on our culture as humans. But really, we should only be focusing on things like this when it's time because right now we should be focusing on war famine disparaging gaps in incomes and wealth,  it's only growing, businesses that are in control of the government by feeding both sides of the party's tons of money and buying the vote. Reducing the overreach of government and keeping every freedom that we still have that we've not pissed away yet.\n\nBecause when all that's taken away and you're hungry and you have no money and you have no freedom, you're not going to give two shits about what somebody's wearing. \n\nYou'll just want the basics. And we are really close to that, if we could just put our energy towards fighting this situation from actually happening. There are bigger fish to fry and the media is spinning a message, and children being fed this message, so that you focus on this bullshit instead of the reality of what's really happening around you. \n\nI don't get this whole cultural appropriation movement. It just seems like more bullshit nonsense that people are being fed and shamed for if they don't believe it.  Look over here people. Fight with each other people. All so they don't fight with us, the real ones who are fucking over your life. Says top 3%.",

Cultural appreciation is when a culture is openly shared with you by someone from that culture and you acknowledge and respect its origins. Cultural appropriation is mimicking the culture without invitation or often much knowledge, often to mock it or to otherwise claim it as your own invention because it\u2019s \u201ctrendy\u201d or something. Take cornrows for example, Black women in the US are frequently denied jobs or promotions, sent home from school, etc for wearing natural hairstyles because they\u2019re \u201cunprofessional\u201d or \u201cdistracting\u201d, but yet when white girls started wearing \u201cbox braids\u201d it was \u201ccute\u201d and \u201ctrendy\u201d. \n\nSame thing more recently with non-religious white women throwing on a \u201cbalaclava\u201d with their outfit (but it wouldn\u2019t even actually cover their hair half the time and they didn\u2019t attempt to follow other modesty standards). When they did it, it was a \u201cfashion statement\u201d but meanwhile when I wear one for religious purposes I\u2019m \u201coppressed/forced to wear it by men\u201d and a \u201csecurity threat\u201d and need to be swabbed for bomb residue every time I go to an airport and had to jump through several hoops to even have a passport photo with it and there are countries attempting to ban me from wearing it but yeah okay they can wear it whenever they want?\n\nIt\u2019s not the mixing of cultures people are upset about, it\u2019s the dual standards",
