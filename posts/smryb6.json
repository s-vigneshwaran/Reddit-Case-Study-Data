  "text": "Atheists NEED to start joining school boards and/or attend school board meetings! Evangelicals are infiltrating school boards and we need to counter that\nA new tactic used by religious regressives and the alt right is to become members of school boards. They then terrorize children, parents, and teachers. What you can do to combat that is to become a member of your local school board or even just visit the school board meetings. Local politics are important. Regressives have launched a full-blown war on education and for those of us who value science, history, and truth we can combat them by joining our local school board or attending local school board meetings.\n\nFor those of us who value science and are disturbed by evangelicals banning books and banning science, we need to combat them by joining our local school boards or attending our local school boards. The evangelical cult of anti-science is trying to destroy education and for atheists who value science and truth and helping young people have a good education, we should know that we can help by becoming engaged with our local school boards.\n\nFind your local school board with this: https://xqsuperschool.org/school-board-lookup\n\nThis site shows you proposed book bans across the country so you can take activism against bans and it also has a tool to help donate books that theocrats and neo-Nazis are banning to libraries and schools: https://www.redwine.blue/bbb\n\nIf you see an alt right psychopath enter or try to enter local politics or a school board and attempt to ban books you can tip the media: https://www.cnn.com/tips/\n\nAlso you can record them saying racist things and tip the videos to the media as well. Remember that police brutality became a mainstream discussion after people realized they have cameras on their phones. It\u2019s time to make the war on education became more known\n\nAlso report violent threats against students, teachers, and authors to the feds: https://www.fbi.gov/tips",

Criminal Harassment is a real thing defined as personally-targeted behavior meant to alarm, intimidate or terrorize the target and causes reasonable fear for their own/family's safety.\n\nThings that count as criminal harassment might include\n- surrounding someone's car and yelling threats at them\n- bombarding them with hate mail and threats (physical or email)\n- Stalking (showing up at their home or workplace repeatedly)\n- Cyberstalking (repeated unwanted contact through any electronic communication platform)\n\nIt's a whole process to get to criminal harassment charges, but a great start is restraining orders. **If you're on the school board and people are threatening or harassing you, file police reports and get a restraining order against them**.\n\nOne you have a restraining order, any of that behavior continuing is now a felony. In some cases, they would not even be legally allowed to go to the board meetings anymore.\n\nDo not take this kind of abuse sitting down. There are ways to fight back and even if they seem inefficient or not enough *you should still use them* because it's better than just letting them dismantle our society and steamroll us into a theocracy.",

The higher the risk of breaking a rule, the more likely it is to be followed. The penalty for breaking the rule \"no murdering\" is severe, and so it is broken very pretty infrequently compared to something like \"no driving over the speed limit\" which has much less severe consequences.\n\nThe idea here is to show them there *are* consequences instead of just letting them get away with it because *years of getting away with this shit is why it has gotten so bad*.",

These people will say its not worth doing the right thing, if its going to put her and her family in danger. And thats an issue.\n\nor how about that former felon in texas that got 5 years for trying to vote, despite telling the election worker she was a former felon and wasnt sure if she could vote and had her vote put on a provisional ballot, which we do when we arent sure of things.

According to trusted sources, my competition is handpicked by our superintendent, as well as a straight up covid denier, and also president of the PTA at one of the three elementary schools in our district.\n\nI don't know how much of that is true, other than the PTA thing, but I have seen pics of her very cozy with our superintendent. \n\nHe has been stacking the district with his own people, not following hiring protocol, and while he froze teacher pay throughout the pandemic, took an 18% pay increase in 2021 and a 21% increase ( an additional $48K a year) just a few weeks ago. \n\nMeanwhile we are over budget in paying for Special Ed services because we can't keep staff (we have the lowest pay of any districts around, despite having some of the highest median house prices in the area) and have to resort to hiring contractors at an additional $25K a year to what we'd normally pay for salary. We'll never close that gap.\n\nI live in Bexar County (San Antonio), but we border Comal County, and my school district is Comal ISD.\n\nThe guy in my seat on the board currently became the \"science guy\" during the pandemic, quoting crazy conspiracy articles about masks killing people and being bad for children to push the board to (in a closed meeting parents weren't told of) remove masks and all contract tracing.\n\nI ended up homeschooling my kids for a second year because of this. They're back now, and I'm not going to take this sitting down anymore.\n\nIf anyone lives in this area and would like to help me campaign or blockwalk or do calls, or even put a sign in your yard, please let me know. I live in Comal ISD Single Member District 6, which encompasses Timberwood Park and part of Indian Springs. You can reach me via the contact form on [amberforcisd.com](https://amberforcisd.com).",

There are kids going into kindergarten who have never been read to before.\n\nEducation is 90% parental responsibility. You can have the best teacher in the world, but if the kid doesn't value being at school and learning then there's no point. Parents relying solely on schools for their kids to be smart then blaming the schools makes kids not trust schools.\n\nWe need better parents.",

They are essentially \u2018winning\u2019 at meritocracy and will pass on these advantages of wealth and better education.\n\nI\u2019m in favor of improving education, but a systemic problem where parents and children of them are still undereducated at home and in schools is an issue.

They genuinely believe they're in a battle between literal good and evil.  If they actually take the time to let fear enter into their equation, they just bring guns.  \n\n* Law enforcement is on their side.  Go look at [how many people showed up for Dakota Access Pipeline protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakota_Access_Pipeline_protests#:~:text=By%20late%20September%2C%20NBC%20News,at%20the%20camps%20on%20weekends.).  From that article, \"several thousand\" and police still showed up with tear gas, less lethal weapons and water cannons.  In Canada \"several thousand\" people show up for the Truck thing and the RCMP goes \"Well, we don't feel like there's a policing solution to this\".  Or (to put emphasis back on the first bullet point) go look at the Michigan Capitol protests...  Redcaps and anti-vaxxers show up with guns and police are polite and quiet.\n\n* Media is on their side.  Look at how much coverage a Trump rally got or the Truck Convoy gets.  Carefully set camera angles that ignore huge gaps in seats or that the \"Truck Convoy\" is just a few trucks and a shitload of dipshits in personally owned vehicles.  Now contrast that with how much coverage you saw of Occupy, Dakota or even the Million Woman March after Trump took office.\n\nThere are other factors as well, like wealth disparity, use of social safety nets and the like, but those big three right there are going to hamstring you every time.",

There is something in the universe that unfolds for justice and so in Montgomery we felt somehow that as we struggled we had cosmic companionship.

The Clinton campaign acted as if stopping Trump was a good enough motivator to get people out to vote, but you have to have a message to get people to the polls.  As much as some in the media like to paint Biden's victory on just \"not being Trump\", I don't think that's completely accurate.  While Trump's failings did become far more evident after his presidency, Biden also went into the election with a platform that included progressive policies clearly meant to court the progressive wing of the party.  Clinton did none of that, she acted as if Bernie Sanders was some kind of interloper rudely trying to deprive her of the presidency she deserved.  I voted for Clinton in the 2016 general election, but I can see why a lot of people stayed home.",

Which I and most progressives did.\n\nIf you think I'm wrong, show me the data that shows Bernie primary voters didn't overwhelmingly vote for her in the general, and show me the data that shows progressives had lower turnout for her than the general electorate. \n\nFact is she was an uninspired, toxic candidate (regardless of whether or not that was fair, this was the challenge her campaign failed to overcome) and the fact that it was so close means her campaign could have made a few minor changes and won. What if she went to Wisconsin? What if she campaigned more heavily in red states? She and her campaign should take the blame, not voters. If you want to win, you have to stop thinking the voters need to change- you need to put up candidates and policies that inspire voters. \n\nThe incessant desire to blame progressives (voters and politicians) for moderate failures is not based in reality.",

But the fact of the matter is that the mainstream democrats have had a dearth of good candidates since Obama. Even including the progressives, we have a bunch of candidates with small but fervent followings, and nobody with broad appeal. Part of the problem is that our political system has become unimaginably corrupt over the last 15 years, and anyone who tries to take on that issue (which is a popular one) gets squelched by the party machine, which fucking relishes in the corruption. Fundraising is all they know how to do now, and that means that corporations run the show.

They scream louder that they are being silenced and oppressed and treated unfairly and it\u2019s a conspiracy against them. The media HAS reported the real story. But theirs is ALSO reported and twisted and fed to those groups. It may feel like I\u2019m trying to argue with you, I\u2019m not.

      "text": "YES!!!! THIS IS HAPPENING ALL OVER! Especially in small town america. My wife is currently going through a legal battle for her job as a high school math teacher because a super devout Catholic who is the VP on the school board is butt hurt over a rainbow magnet with the word ally below it my wife keeps in her room on a file cabinet in the back of the room. The magnet is literally 2x4 inches and draws no attention. But she claims it is propaganda and is abusing her power to get it removed.  She claims it makes her daughter feel uncomfortable.  She has went behind the backs of other school board members to get the president who is also Catholic and goes to the same church on her side.  Nevermind the fact that I am also a member of this church and my children attend church classes, CCD for those in the know.  But I am not willing to sell myself to something that does nothing but preach hate and separation. My kids only attend to keep my mom happy. But after this ordeal I have had many discussions of taking my children out of these classes. I always hated going as a kid but it made me very aware that it was not a way I wanted to live my life.  I was never a sheep. I hated following the norm and always wanted to be left alone and rather lead than follow.  And because of that I have ruffled many feathers and don't have many people to stand with me. But luckily my wife is well liked and has great people helping her stand and fight.",

This is not a new tactic by any stretch of the imagination.  The John Birch Society (JBS), the anti-intellectual antecedent of QAnon, and the crazy uncle of the Koch network and the Bradley foundation, first promoted this tactic in the 1960s.  The people behind the current strategy are closely following the JBS playbook.  None of this is a coincidence.  The most powerful and influential conservative groups were started by founders who also co-founded JBS.",

Our current 'remote learning' systems are just a bandaid and a temporary measure, but I think if we design, from the ground up, a better way to educate, challenge, and socialize our children it would pay massive dividends in the years to come.\n\nI'm not smart enough to know *how* things should be redesigned, but I think it's obvious that our current system is inefficient, ineffective, often unfair, and very prone to a single person or a small group of people changing \"facts\" for personal, religious, or political reasons.\n\n\"But school is used as childcare so people can go to work?\"  -  Maybe don't do that then.  There are other solutions to childcare that can be implemented if you're talking about redesigned the system from the ground up.\n\nOf course, all this is just a pipe dream, but there ya go.",

To not let them use bathroom that they\u2019re comfortable in?\n\nThe fact is there are biological reasons for feeling the way they feel, and Republican lawmakers seem to think that they know better than the science. That there\u2019s just something \u201cmentally wrong\u201c with them. And it\u2019s just the way their body developed. The way their hormones are making them feel. The way their brain developed.  Republicans continuously treat it as some sort of a moral failing and that\u2019s just wrong and it\u2019s weird.\n\nAs for evolution, a lot of Republicans are young earth creationists. You don\u2019t find that particular ideology as much on the left. They questioned the science because the science contradicts their reading of the Bible. It\u2019s not about scientific literacy or understanding the basis for the conclusion that evolution happened and continues to happen. It\u2019s not being willing to look at the science because it contradicts their worldview.\n\nas for climate change, in the last 10 years or so they\u2019re starting to recognize, because it\u2019s undeniable, that it\u2019s happening, but once again they don\u2019t except the science of anthropogenic climate change. They don\u2019t think we had anything to do with it. I think we only have data for 100 years because I haven\u2019t looked at the science, but we have millions of years of data. And the greenhouse effect was discovered like 300 years ago. (I may be off on that date, but it\u2019s much earlier than 1900.) An exponential rise in carbon in the atmosphere just completely coincidentally coincides with the rise of the use of the automobile and fossil fuels? That\u2019s ridiculous of course it\u2019s caused by humans. But Republicans don\u2019t want to admit that because doing anything about it would go against their interests. We are still starting to see younger Republicans actually recognize that we have a problem that needs fixing, but boomers are still digging in their heels. They don\u2019t have skin in the game I guess so it doesn\u2019t matter to them.",

They put members of the ID community on the stands as witnesses and it was basically shown to be the nonsense scientists had said it is.

The board will  read the book, and discuss whether the book should be removed, or only allowed in certain grades and up.\n\nuntill a decision has been made the book will stay in the library.\n\nevery month (if a book has been submitted) a list of all the books and the reason they are being challenged will be sent to all parents with the normal news letter. and any books removed will include the reason why from the board members that voted yes, with their names attached to the response. (same for if the book is staying) (if possible will be printed in the local newspaper)\n\nthe point of it is to make sure \"concerned citizens\" actually understand what the book is about and so books like Fahrenheit 451 dont get banned because a bible was burned. (even though part of the point of the book is how banning books isnt a good thing). and to actually have a discussion on the book.\n\nThe publishing the reason a book was banned and publishing why the various people voted for banning it is kinda to shame them a bit. if the only reason they want to ban a book about an lgbt+ couple is because the characters are gay but would be ok with it if the characters were straight, then that person would have to be ok with having that published in the paper with their name attached to it.",

It resulted in a century of legal bigotry in our country, the effects of which still linger. In my opinion, there's nothing wrong with teaching kids about that. It doesn't mean they need to feel personally responsible for the events of the past, but, as the saying goes, \"those who forget the past, are doomed to repeat it\".",

          "text": "I\u2019m not na athiest, but I do support this idea of atheist on school boards. Atheist do tend to respect science and evidence and make decisions based on those things.  Atheists tend to be more willing to expressed feelings about separation of church and state. Atheists are more willing to defend the right of students and their families to not have religions forced on them. That seems like it\u2019s only in the interest of atheist, but I think it\u2019s in the interest of everyone. For example, evangelical parents probably don\u2019t want their child taught to say the Hail Mary. Jewish parents don\u2019t want their child bullied for not believing in the divinity of Jesus.  Islamic and Hindu parents want their children to be able to practice their faith\u2018s without catching crap from their teachers about it. And yes, atheist parents want their children to not have to put up A bunch of religious nonsense when they should be learning science. Or math. Or English.  I think atheists and those who respect their perspectives are the right people To counter the current wave of right wing pressure being put on school boards.",
