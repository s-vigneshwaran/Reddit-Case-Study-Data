However, there are a few things that I've noticed that make me think it might be a bit low or off or w/e.  \n\n\nThis guy is about as ripped as me, so I'm pretty sure this dude works out a lot lol.  I'll bet women feel safe in those arms lmao.  Face looks a bit by mine not a lot just a bit like 10-20%.  \n\n\nAnd by the way guys, Testosterone is SUPER important if you want to socialize with others without much anxiety or effort, feel good about yourself (it has antidepressant effects), have the motivation and drive to get shit done, think more clearly, remember stuff better, get hard more easily, last longer in bed:  \n\n\n(I have the opposite problem were i last too long like 45 min or more - might sound nice but its a pain in the ass having to go that long.  I'd rather have 45 min then like 5 min, but if I had it my way I'd last about 15-20 minutes or so to get there).  \n\n\nThere are a lot of other benefits to having a good amount of testosterone and not being low on it (When I went 15 days w/o getting off I was talkin to the prettiest girls (I'm in the NA program so I get out a lot) with very little effort, like I didn't think about how hot they were or feel insecure about anything I said, I just said stuff and it was like our energy was perfectly matched up.  Hell, it might have gotten me up from being an aquaintance with this girl I was kinda seeing in 2019 to being 'Guy B' for her (If you know anything about the dating game it's really good to be Guy B, b/c even if you aren't dating her, you're the one her boyfriend/man is going to be worried about (And if he's stupid and ignorant to the fact that most girls have a 'Guy B' so they don't have to put as much work into monkey branching - I've even had plenty of women confirm this for me, and I've had that shit happen to me when I was in my early, maybe mid 20s.  \n\n\nGood luck, guys!!!  I'm not on here often but if you message me, I'll try to get back to you if you need somebody to talk to!!",
