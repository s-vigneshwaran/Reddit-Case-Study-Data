My \u201cHa\u201d is because this teacher wasn\u2019t trying \nto bring the point home in a way that reven hormonal teenagers would take seriously. \n\nNo. Then the teacher would have put it in a way that shot fear into the girls *and the boys*.\n\nBut that phrasing? He was scanning the classroom and hoping for involuntary physical reactions from the girls, however minute. \n\nI know now the teacher I remember was probably sitting to cover up an erection. \n\nI could be slandering the teacher you recall if he was trying to get the girls to understand the societal truth: \u201cWe\u2019re expecting a baby\u201d is a lovely statement, but only the female is pregnant.  If unmarried and the biological father\u2019s family decides they are moving to another state\u2026not every girl has relatives with shotguns and a marriage ceremony on hand. \n\nIt\u2019s so agonizing. Force people to do the right thing and then often the children pay the price. \n\nIf it were up to me, I\u2019d make us the other way around; we\u2019d only be able to have kids when both parties knew and were ready for the next step. \n\nIt wouldn\u2019t matter if they were broke or \u201cchallenged\u201d in some way. \n\nThey just would have to be ready. I mean even just in the way that one sees a lost dog in the snow or a loud lost parrot\u2026as a result of choosing to get involved and stay involved, their life will change here and there, not just for the worse. \n\nThat kind of ready.",

The risks are minimal. You are literally at far greater risk driving home from work. \n\nI am well aware of the history of IUDs.

Since the FDA\u2019s initial approval of Mirena in 2000, the federal agency has amassed 95,008 reports about the drug in its Adverse Events Reporting System, or FAERS. The number of complaints have risen as the IUD has gained popularity. Since 2007, complaints have increased tenfold. More than a third of the reports cite expulsion of the Mirena from the uterus (32,084) or dislocation of the device (10,793).

You think you\u2019re on to something here, but Mirena is a very safe, well tolerated contraceptive option. The issue of pseudo tumor cerebri will be proven false. Levonorgestrel is an old progestin.

There is also another \"morning after\" pill known as ullipristal acetate which works in a slightly different way but is effective up until 120 hours at 98% too and for if plan b isn't suitable or past the window for treatment, however, this does have some more fiddly pharmacokinetics so not everyone is suitable (usually people on antiepileptic medicines) but if you are, Ullipristal acetate (EllaOne) is definitely the better of the 2. Although the reigning champ has to be the coil for effectiveness but probably not the most comfortable and IUD rejection can be gnarly but not as common as seems",

I personally lean libertarian, which means I get called left wing by right wing people, and right wing by left wing people.When in reality I'm pretty close to center on a left and right axis, I just happen to be fairly far out of the authoritarian range. This leads me to hold libertarian views that often get associated with the left or right and to be opposed the the authoritarian aspects of both. I guess what I'm saying in a long winded way is what you see on social media or from the two main parties generally isn't a good example of the average US population.

I support individual liberty and smallish government, but I can't quite go to the borderline anarchy many of them want.\n\nHonestly probably not, the handful of Dems I can think of that I would be mostly happy with don't have a chance of winning. Both parties are too willing to be authoritarian these days, but the Republicans tend to at least favor a few of the things I support. Likely just to get votes rather than out of some moral reasoning, but something is better than nothing. At this point I hope neither of them win. I'm afraid both parties will run shit candidates again and we'll be \"damned if we do, damned if we don't\". I like some of the compromise/independent movements I've heard of, but with the social media overlords I don't think they have much chance of ever succeeding. Anything that starts gaining momentum seems to get shut down.\n\nP.S. I'm not sure saying most Americans hope the Dems win is really fair. Even when faced with having Trump as president 53% of people voted against Hillary, and 49% voted against Biden. The Dems might have a slight majority or plurality, but it's hard to say with all the various ways votes are suppressed either with sketchiness or just by the process. There are a lot of people from both sides that don't vote simply because they are in a district where their vote won't change anything.",

Unfortunately both parties have drawn lines in the sand that hinders any candidates having a nuanced platform. America needs more options, whether that's third party or smaller coalitions inside the major parties. I live here and have spent a decent amount of time thinking about the topic and at this point I've just thrown my hands up. Both parties, and their voters claim to want something then turn right around and do the opposite when it benefits them. I think that's a human thing though and not something unique to American politics.",

It says that the earth had no plants because god hadn\u2019t made it rain yet. But then god made Adam to work the plants, then, without rain, god sprouted the garden of eden to make Adam work. He also made the animals to help him work , but noticed he was lonely, but then the next verse stated Eve was made to help him tend to the plants and animals, which god made to help him tend the plants.",

I've come to value the messy reality of the need for moral compromises in definitions and premises more in a democracy where we necessarily all disagree at least some amount, and the Kantian purity demands have kinda fallen away over time. The thing that did the big flip for me though, when I first switched from pro-life to pro-choice, was the realization there were far more sophisticated brains in bugs and lizards and such than an embryo for a big chunk of the pregnancy, and I just couldn't sit right with the idea of govt limiting women's rights for a non-conscious thing for three months just for the sake of internal consistency against every edge case etc.",

Her due date was Feb 7th which is coming up and a hard day for me. \n\nI wasn't taking sex, contraception, anything lightly. I tried so hard to not get pregnant. I did everything I was supposed to. When it came down to the wire, I had to look at my 5 year old compared to the small clump of cells and make a choice. I chose my already living, breathing son over a dice roll of if he'd have a parent. \n\nFeb 7th hurts every year. So absolutely FUCK her and everyone like her.",

The most common form of female birth control is an oral contraceptive pill ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430882/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430882/)). From your link, that has an annual failure rate of 7%.\n\nThe probability that both of those methods will fail for someone over a given year is 0.0091, or about a 0.99 probability of not getting pregnant for a given year, using these two contraception methods.\n\nSounds great, if you're a moron who either didn't learn math in school or doesn't realize that people have sex for more than one year of their lives.\n\nThe 5 year cumulative probability of becoming pregnant, even with a 0.99 probability of avoiding pregnancy in a single year, is 1-(0.99\\^5), or close to 5%. The 10 year cumulative probability is close to 10%.\n\nFrom [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3638203/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3638203/):\n\n>Even a low annual risk of pregnancy implies a high cumulative risk of pregnancy during a lifetime of use. For example, an annual probability of pregnancy of 3% implies a 26% probability of pregnancy over 10 years.\n\nI'll ask again: did you fail math?",

No of course not. What about driving to work and killing 20 bugs, things larger and more developed and aware than a fetus, in the process? Also no of course. What about killing huge and quite intelligent animals, who can feel pain and experience life and whatnot in ways completely impossible for fetuses? Etc etc. \n\nBUT anyway with all that said, my initial point was solely in response to calling an embryo or fetus a \"kid\" and how ridiculous that is.",

I think at the start of fertilization the embryo acquires some amount of value, then that value slowly builds until it is an infant (in-line with its physical development, though I wouldn't call it linear, probably more of an e^x shape).\n\n> I'd say that is completely up to the person carrying it in their body. \n\nThis is a bit absurd though. If a woman decided her 1 week old embryo was more valuable than my dog, and made some sort of life or death moral decision based on that, I'd consider her deranged. And if a woman 9 months pregnant and one day away from her due date decided her child had zero value and killed it, I'd also consider her deranged.",

Could I really fault them for caring more about their 8-10 week fetus than they do some strangers dog? I don't think so.  \n\nIn your opinion, at what developmental stage does someone else's fetus hold more \"life-value\" than your dog? What about if it was you or your partner's desired fetus?",

Preventing implantation isn't just \"not allowing to grow\" it's purposeful prevention of a standard body process. The embryo needs to implant for nutrition. If I fed someone a pill that stopped their stomach from processing food and they died, I couldn't just say \"not allowing them to acquire nutrients and killing isn't the same, right?\"",

I'm sure you know deep down inside that murder is wrong, and murder appalls you. The problem isn't knowing morality, it's justifying it. If God doesn't exist, if we're just cosmic accidents created in a purposeless universe that didn't have us in mind, if we're just evolved pond scum, then by what objective ground is your empathy based on? Aside from it being your opinion or feelings, why is murder wrong? I know its wrong, you know it's wrong, but what is the justification for believing that. What makes it true that murder is wrong? Objectively. As a Christian I can say murder is wrong, and murderers are evil because all humans are made in the image of God, and God who created them demands that you not murder.\n\nI can point to the serial murderer and say, \"You are wicked and evil and God will judge you for your unrighteousness\". But if you're being honest and consistent with your worldview, all you have a valid claim to say is \"You shouldn't murder because I don't like it\".",

If it's a hinderance to society, can you kill me for it?\n\nDespite saying morals developed for societal benefit, I doubt you will be consistent with that view. I'm certain you will continue to act as if humans are made in the image of God, as if they have something that makes them worth more than the atoms around them. But if there is no God, please tell me why the atoms that make up my body, are more important than the atoms of dirt in the ground outside.\n\nAdditionally, what makes society important? What does it matter if society prospers or collapses? If we're evolved pond scum, what does it matter if someone helps someone, or kills them? If I said I thought killing as many people as possible just for fun was morally good, what makes you objectively right and me objectively wrong?

Yet God, in his divine sovereignty, has the authority to end someone's life on this earth.

He also has permitted governments to bear the sword against evil.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for hearing me out, I appreciate your patience as we discuss these things.",

I acted like morals were objectively true, that it was evil and wrong to murder people. But if I would've been willing to be honest with my atheistic worldview, I would have concluded that we're all evolved pond scum, created by accident in a universe that didn't have us in mind and doesn't care about us, and that we're all going to die someday and nothing we do makes any difference. How then would I be able to say that murder is evil? I couldn't. I could only say that I don't like it. But that's obviously not true, I KNOW it's evil to murder, but there is no way to justify that unless God exists and has imposed a moral law.",

Guess what, we very probably ARE \"evolved pond scum\". All evidence points to that at least, which is a lot more than can be said for religion.\n\n>  nothing we do makes any difference\n\nI'll have to disagree there as well. While in the grand scheme of things, nothing we do seems to make any difference. We do make a difference in the lives of the people around us, and ourselves for that matter. Purpose or not we exist, we are conscious of our existence, and our fellow humans are too. Nothing can negate that experience, and it derives its value merely from the fact we instil value into it. Why not have as a goal to attain the most happiness we could possibly derive, for us and for people around us.",

Where that morality comes from is irrelevant (it probably stems from us being social animals, and by extent empathetic, and capable of altruism), because we can logically conclude it's beneficial to all of us to satisfy that sense of \"morality\".\n\nThat sense of morality, which may be succinctly expressed by the golden rule, can also be built upon, and refined, by logical deductions rather than imposed dogmas. Dogmas that, might I remind you, have caused a great deal of pain.\n\nWhat I'm trying to get to is that while religion tries to play off its version of morality as \"objective\", and \"absolute\", history says otherwise. It was \"moral\" to own slaves, it was \"moral\" for women to be uneducated and stay at home, it was \"moral\" to invade foreign lands and kill infidels. \n\nPlus, some would also argue that a person whose only reason for not doing immoral acts is the fear of retribution is themselves, immoral.\n\nSee, it turns out that not only is religious morality not absolute, it is often times the very opposite of moral.",

                  "text": "Agreed, the pro life movement isn't anti-abortion at all.  They are specifically anti-sex.  It's why they oppose contraception, sex education and any other harm reduction strategy that could still make it seem ok for people to have sex.  Being opposed to abortion is specifically about forcing births in order to punish pregnant women who sinned.  It's why the redhead says \"the child you killed to avoid responsibility.\"\n\nIf you want a handy-dandy way to know this is true, remember that statistically speaking, gun ownership leads to gun violence which leads to gun deaths (murder/suicide), while premarital sex leads to pregnancy which leads to abortion deaths.  All murders are equal in the eyes of the church, but I don't see anyone picketing gun shops with giant photos of murder victims.  Although you can be a safe gun owner or premarital sex-haver, statistically if we reduce either gun ownership or premarital sex across society, you can somewhat reduce overall 'murders/abortions'.  However, the religious right is only interested in reducing 'murders caused by sex' and not 'murders caused by guns'.  This is because they are pro-gun and anti-sex.\n\nIt's why movies get an R rating for showing a penis, but not someone being shot, and why you get an X rating for 10 seconds of cunnilingus but not ever for any amount of gun violence.",

I\u2019m a little sad that it seems from what I\u2019ve read there is an invisible straw man being built up. I can\u2019t speak for all Christian denominations, but Catholics love sex. It\u2019s beautiful. Why else would Pope John Paul II write an entire book about the beauty of it? Sexual intercourse is a gift from God, and no Catholic would argue otherwise, unless they weren\u2019t sure what exactly they were practicing anyways. The vows in the Catholic faith literally involve saying \u201cI do\u201d to the question, \u201cWill you accept children lovingly from God?\u201dAKA will you bring forth new life by having lots of sex. The Catholic Church does not oppose proper sexual education, which involves teaching your children at appropriate ages about their bodies, how they work, what it means to have sex and give your entire self to someone through the process. Yes, the Catholic Church teaches abstinence until marriage. Why? Because the Catholic Church also teaches you are a whole gift worthy of being loved in your entirety, forever, without having to worry if someone is using you for pleasure one day, and is going to throw you out the next because someone better came along who seems more sexually appealing. Obviously there are other reasons for abstinence, but that\u2019s another story. Birth control prevents complete and utter giving of the gift of your entire body to another person because it says I\u2019ll give you all of me, but not my womb, the place where you and the other person could bring forth new life, a sign of the beauty of marriage and goodness. Not to mention it is absolutely horrible for a woman\u2019s body. It essentially tricks it into thinking it\u2019s pregnant for 3 weeks by doping it with fake Pregestorone, and then when you stop taking it your body goes, \u201cOh wait? I\u2019m not pregnant?\u201d You literally put your body through a routine hell cycle every month. There are tons of women who suffer from infertility from having taken birth control for so long. \n\nAlso, no, having a baby is not a punishment for \u201csin.\u201d All children are gifts from God to the family they are conceived in. No child is ever a punishment, ever. There is a difference between saying something is a consequence of an action you are responsible for and saying it is a negative consequence of an action you are responsible for. Babies are consequences of sexual intercourse. That is just biology. But they\u2019re not a negative consequence. That\u2019s just dumb. \n\nAlso, I\u2019d argue all murder is wrong in the eyes of God, but not all murder is equal in the eyes of God. There is differing moral culpability for a mother who kills her child in the womb than a soldier who kills another soldier in war. They\u2019re both murder. They both need atoning for it. But, one is inherently less evil than the other.",

Which is why I said it makes some sense for the dividing line to be when the egg no longer has the same genetic makeup as the mother's cells.",

You don\u2019t trust FDA?\n\nAlso, no, that site says it doesn\u2019t terminate a pregnancy, because they define a pregnancy as a fetus in the womb. Thats true as it kills the human (the fertilized egg) before it\u2019s implanted in the womb. Still kills the human, just not a \u201cpregnancy\u201d. Again, I trust the site, I don\u2019t trust the marketing, or your reading skills\n\n\nEdit: for those who only see deleted, they replied that they don\u2019t believe the FDA, not much left to this conversation once they disagree with the FDA.",

(It will be released later there for it\u2019s not the same as birth control pills, it doesn\u2019t stop ovulation, it just delays it) This then means the sperm has nothing to fertilise. Which then means there is nothing to implant into the womb & therefor no baby. It\u2019s best taken as soon as possible & depending on brands can work up to 72 hrs later. HOWEVER it isn\u2019t the best option for emergency contraception because if ovulation has already occurred it is completely redundant. Studies have show that it doesn\u2019t have an effect on implantation & therefor they cannot say if it would or wouldn\u2019t stop it from occurring. There\u2019s a theory it makes the wombs lining inhospitable for a zygote (what a fertilise egg is called) to implant but this hasn\u2019t be supported by studies. They cannot say it does or doesn\u2019t stop implantation. The general consensus from science & from doctors is that it doesn\u2019t impact implantation of a Zygote so therefor this adds to it being a less than reliable emergency contraceptive. The coil or IUD as Americans call it, is a much better option with a much smaller failure rate. With that being said the morning after pill/Plan B is better than no emergency contraception in the event of an accident. You likely didn\u2019t need half of this information but if there\u2019s a person out there who doesn\u2019t understand how plan B works & this helps them know & make informed choices then that\u2019s great!

If a fertilized egg is implanted prior to taking Plan B, Plan B will not work.\"\n\n- FDA.gov\n\nDepending upon what you personally believe it can be viewed as abortion. Fertilization would be conception, which is the marriage of viable egg and viable sperm. If you then prevent that life from attaching to the womb you have actively prevented it developing after conception.\n\nI don't personally believe this, but Im not sure why people are so dismissive of someone else's beliefs...I mean if she believes you're killing humans shouldn't she want to stop that and view that as deplorable?",

The decision is always that of the woman carrying. No old man in a position of power should have a hand in what happens to my vagina. Again, abortions will happen no matter what, but will they be safe and will they be done with guidance and science and care? That's up to the legal system.",

If egg and sperm still meet because of bad timing, fertilization is still somewhat less likely.

Taking PlanB makes it less likely to have a fertilized egg. So it lessens the chance of losing a fertilized egg. If someone thinks life starts at fertilization, they should support preventative methods *including PlanB*, and they should favor IVF over natural conception.",

It may reduce implantation rates, I'm not sure there's any evidence of that though. If you have already ovulated (typically 14 days before menstruation begins) then it will likely have no effect.\n\nBut yes, implantation typically occurs in the first 7 days after fertilization, while the zygote is a literal blob of cells referred to as the inner cell mass of a blastocyst. The majority of embryos fail to successfully implant regardless, but you don't see any of these religious whack-jobs cursing God for his inept design causing the deaths of hundreds of millions of \"human lives\" every year. Nor do you see them championing reproductive health as a realistic means of reducing abortion rates via preventing the pregnancy in the first case, as demonstrated in this video.\n\nTurns out they don't actually care about human life they just enjoy the feeling of moral superiority and punishing young women for having sex. I've had one of these nut-jobs try to damn me to hell as I was wheeling her into the OR for her very own abortion, but her case was special of course, she was allowed to have an abortion. I've also had a \"pro-life\" neighbor murder her minutes old grandchild because she did not want the shame (crazy religious mental gymnastics) of having a knocked up teenage daughter. Opting instead to drown the newborn in the sink and bury it in the backyard while informing the teenage mother that the baby had been put up for adoption.",

Plan B technically can induce the abortion of a fertilized egg, which is an abortion. But it\u2019s not always been fertilized after sex. \n\nSome folks can be pro contraception (preventing fertilization) but be against abortive measures (plan b) because they believe that life begins at conception. \n\nAgain it varies ofc.. some people believe sperm is life.. some believe eggs are life.. some only when they\u2019re combined. Some people not until first heart beat.. some not until born.. some not until first breath.. etc\n\nHaving a belief is 100% fine. But advocating for government to impose that belief on the population is not appropriate\u2026 at least not for a \u2018christian\u2019. Jesus didn\u2019t try to overturn laws, didn\u2019t try to fight Caesar on things.. on the contrary he said we have to live within Caesars laws (paying taxes for example), effectively that a Christian would be in relative subjection to the laws of the land. (Of course I\u2019m assuming this lady is a \u2018Christian\u2019)",

Stop engaging them, stop trying to counter their bullshit arguments. They make up shit out of thin air in 1 minute, then we spend an hour or more making reasoned and logical rebuttals and they just move on to the next lie. My whole point above is to stop engaging them within that game the fascists love to play.\n\n>It\u2019s easy to criticize \u201cestablishment democrats\u201d for not making the anti abortion kooks go away, but what exactly can they do?\n\nThe Democratic Establishment doesn't *want* to do anything about it, just like they don't *want* to do anything about gun control. Those are perpetually unresolved social issues they use for fundraising. I used to believe they really wanted to improve the country and the lives of our citizens, but they have zero intention of doing anything but raking in that sweet sweet corporate cash. \n\nThose first 2 years of the Obama Administration opened my eyes to their game. The Democrats had the opportunity to pass any gun control legislation they wanted but they didn't even talk about gun control until they lost the 2010 midterms and *then* they started talking about gun control legislation when they had zero chance of passing anything. Instead those first 2 years of Obama's presidency they gave us the healthcare plan cooked up by a Conservative Think-tank in response to Hillary's First Lady pet project that went nowhere. People call it Obamacare but it's truly Republicancare.\n\nSo what can we do to actually get something positive done? We have to primary every single Establishment Democrat in every election at every level of government.  We must primary every Establishment Democrat that continues to cut our legs out from underneath us with Reagan-era economic & tax schemes and opposition to Worker's Rights & Unions. We must primary every Establishment Democrat that continues making corrupt backroom deals with the multibillion dollar multinational corporations, billionaires, banks, and the Military Industrial Complex who are all responsible for the unjust imprisonment of our fellow human beings, and responsible for the gross income & wealth inequality. We have to show those who have given up or otherwise not engaged in politics that *we* are willing to change and to fight for them if we have any hope of them standing shoulder to shoulder with us in this fight. We must inform and educate those who are not politically active and encourage them to vote. We already have a built in disadvantage at the ballot box and State by State the Republicans are drafting and passing laws to further disadvantage, dispossess, and disenfranchise minorities, the poor, and the powerless. So we have to outwork them tenfold just to activate enough voters to outvote them 2 to 1 and that's just to break even. We have to do it *now* or all is lost, and we can't waste any of our time arguing with or trying to educate and convert Conservatives because no matter how far we stretch our hands across the aisle, now matter how much we compromise our values to just \"get *something* done\" they will not work with us. The time for attempts at compromise is over, it's all or nothing, and those Establishment Democrats who brought us to this point have zero interest in anything but their own pockets and power.",

If people had paid more attention to Trump\u2019s abortion views, maybe we wouldn\u2019t have gotten 3 new ultra-ideological, right wing, lifelong justices.  If roughly 100k people in a handful of states had taken the anti-abortion people more seriously, we\u2019d have a solidly liberal court today, and abortion rights would be safe.\n\nI don\u2019t see how primarying all of the people in favor of abortion rights would help anything.  The current threat to abortion rights comes from an alt-right president and a Republican congress.\n\nIt seems like what you really want is for the Democrats to be all progressives.  But America isn\u2019t that left leaning as a nation.  The dems would get *killed* if they shifted hard left.

Anyhow, the intent is to own a bunch of it and stir up hype and get a bunch of people buying the stock, thinking that it's going up and they need to jump in now before it gets too expensive (I don't know about the stock market, but in crypto this is often called FOMO - fear of missing out).  After a bunch of people have bought in and the price has increased (\"pumped\") then they sell like crazy (dump) at the higher price before the suckers who just bought in know what's happening.\n\nBut if you're fucked in the head like me, pump and dump also sounds like getting pregnant (pump) and having an abortion (dump).\n\nEdit: Thanks for coming to my TED talk.",

Arguing whether you see it as a child or not is up to you but iirc its not considered a person until after a certain number of weeks well past the abortion laws or once its born.  Doesnt matter though since pro lifers seems to care more about whats in the body of some female than kids who actually need support like food and shelter\n\nPs. No not all pro lifers are like this. So to the ones who actually care good on you. To those who stand outside of abortion clinics harassing innocent people. Go fly a kite you bitter \"Pro lifers\"",

But pro lifers don't have the right to harass other people on that topic and stop them from getting an abortion.\n\nNo there is no scientific consensus that's why I stated if you'd like to debate what a child is that is up to you. I won't say your wrong but I certainly do not agree with that opinion.\n\nIts great that you care but it seems more people care about pumping kids into a dying world than to help those who are born and need help.\n\nI looked at a 20 week year old and I still don't believe its murder. They don't even have fully developed organs and lungs to survive outside of the mothers womb.\n\nI think abortion is acceptable. I don't want to see more children suffer because selfish parents think with their sexual organs instead of their brain. Considering in our day and age it takes a lot to raise a kid: Financially, mentally and physically. And even then its hard to raise a child. No one is doing any good having kids when they themselves are not in the position to take care of them and eventually have a kid taken away and put in a not so great system.\n\nThough I'm not saying you need to be perfect to raise a kid but you need to understand what that cost is and how much work it actually is instead of having kids because \"you felt like it\".",

Do you own anything that took away the life of an animal or plant, such as a fur coat, paper, or even some medications? It\u2019s hypocritical to make claims such as \u201cI feel sympathy for living things that cannot defend themselves,\u201d only when it comes to one specific situation. Sure, eating meat is not the same thing as choosing to terminate a pregnancy, but by your logic those things are correlated via the \u201cdefenseless\u201d argument.\n\nI don\u2019t expect you to agree with me, but please understand that nobody is \u201cbrainwashed.\u201d Abortions aren\u2019t the same thing as birth control, and those who choose to abort aren\u2019t heartless or soulless. Have you ever known someone who aborted? There is serious trauma that comes with terminating a pregnancy, I wouldn\u2019t consider those people heartless or brainwashed.

Fertilization can happen quite quickly, well under 48 hours. Now that's certainly not a baby, not a fetus, and just barely a zygote, so it's not murder by any stretch to \"abort\" those cells.\n\nThat's it, that's all I'm saying.

          "text": "My wife and I have been trying for years to have kids, and after several IUIs and an IVF attempt, she finally was pregnant. In week 8, 4 days ago, we had an ultrasound. It stopped growing on its own and was nonviable. Some might say \"dead\" because some cells fluttered, but there was never any blood flow, no heart, no lungs, and no brain. It did have limbs but looked just like a dolphin or horse fetus at this stage. How dead can it be if it never was alive any more than bacteria is alive? However, the emotions are real, and we've been crying and depressed all week.\n\nHere's the fun part /s; for IVF, she has to take medication to help keep the implanted embryo, but that means when it becomes a necrotic clump of cells that could kill her, her body doesn't naturally miscarriage. She has to take medication to cause a miscarriage of the \"dead\" fetus. And when I say fetus, I mean a clump of cells that came out like blood during a larger than normal period, not a baby.\n\nIf idiots like that second girl had her way: We couldn't have IVF because not all fertilized eggs get implanted (like the ones with major genetic faults). We would have had to find out the fetus's gender, name it, and get a death certificate, which would do nothing but make us feel even worse. We could not get the drugs to cause a miscarriage and my wife could die a horrible painful death or, at minimum, need a hysterectomy. Our educated asses would never have kids, and her dumbass would pop out several \u00e0 la Idiocracy. That girl has no clue the damage her beliefs cause. She is a selfish, ignorant, little brat. If you're not a doctor or somewho has gone through this, then shut up. That's probably unfair; she probably had several abortions before dropping out of school.\n\nEveryone should have autonomy of their own bodies, including having an abortion if they want/need one. It is no one else's business. Anyway, I'm going to try and not cry the rest of the evening. Thanks for letting me vent.",

That number is low because person may have already ovulated before sex and conception already occurred. Ovulation happens about once a month and if not fertilized an egg dies in 12 to 24 hours. Sperm can live in a woman's body for 5 days. So the chances of a woman having an egg sitting before or when she has sex and conceiving immediately is much lower than pregnancy from ovulation after sex.\n\nThe mechanism for stopping ovulation and impeding sperm is why it's effectiveness goes down with the length of time between sex and taking the pill, because if ovulation has occurred prior to taking it, it is practically useless.\n\nThis is where it gets the nickname \"the morning after pill\". You have to take it as soon as possible.\n\nScientifically the research doesn't show it can prevent implantation. Though completely ruling it out would be a very ethically fraught experiment.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/06/health/research/morning-after-pills-dont-block-implantation-science-suggests.html",

It\u2019s a feeble attempt at adding legitimacy to their largely *unreasonable* and *illogical* emotion-based beliefs. \n\nConservatism aims to preserve the status quo and reinforce hierarchies through structures of power.

They effectively have no meaningful addition to public discourse so we then lose the ability to articulate complex ideas. This is a fundamental tenet of fascism and it is highly successful when employed correctly (ex. Everything I disagree with is *communism* or *socialism*.

I know the medical community has challenged that but it\u2019s the official stance and I\u2019m unfamiliar with contemporary research on the matter. Namely, does it prevent implantation of a fertilized egg? \n\nBut for these individuals, they might believe plan B to be possible abortion. That\u2019s my best guess. Not sure how anyone could argue that an unfertilized egg is a life and frankly even a fertilized egg that hasn\u2019t implanted can\u2019t really be seen as life. It\u2019s just a bit silly at that point. But once an egg implants then it\u2019s just time and nourishment to grow a child (barring miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy) so I think that\u2019s when folks start debating on when life begins.",

I hope that they'll be able to effectively engage in critical thinking one day. Pregnancy is a biological process that we are not obligated to undergo. I can barely speak about having to choose an abortion without crying, with that in mind, what kind of fucked up human would I be to even try to grow a baby (if I could even grow a healthy baby because I had 2 other risk factors on top of the chest mass) and then immediately die or go into cancer treatment after it was born.

So while unlikely it is statistically more likely she has a house of adopted kids than if she lived in any other nation.

I would seriously discourage someone from adopting simply because they're pro-life. Adopting a child is much deeper and more complex than that.",

You don't give a shit what happens to the child afterwards based on the way y'all vote. Cutting WIC, opposing national pre-school.\n\nAnd besides, your leaders are all having gay sex and snorting drugs with prostitutes like that Ted Haggard guy because they're ravenous wolves you idiots think are somehow godly.\n\nChristians believed that life began at inspiration - first breath - for about 2,000 years, and then suddenly contraception and abortion are available and all these right wing churches saw their social control slipping so they changed their minds.\n\nIt's about controlling women and always has been.\n\nI'll believe you're pro life when pro life politicians start supporting childcare and sex education.",

Life Before Birth. 2nd ed. England: Mosby-Wolfe, 1996, p.31] \n\nHuman development begins after the union of male and female gametes or germ cells during a process known as fertilization (conception). Fertilization is a sequence of events that begins with the contact of a sperm (spermatozoon) with a secondary oocyte (ovum) and ends with the fusion of their pronuclei (the haploid nuclei of the sperm and ovum) and the mingling of their chromosomes to form a new cell. This fertilized ovum, known as a zygote, is a large diploid cell that is the beginning, or primordium, of a human being.\"[Moore, Keith L. Essentials of Human Embryology. Toronto: B.C. Decker Inc, 1988, p.2] \n\nIn light of the biological evidence and philosophical arguments discussed herein, it is most reasonable to support the notion that personhood status is present at the point of human fertilization.

There is no correct definition of human, and there never can be. \u201cHuman\u201d is a messy concept with fuzzy edges that can never be objectively correct as it never refers to anything fundamental to reality.\n\nThat\u2019s a pretty minor point though when you completely sidestepped the whole argument of why a human (whatever that is) deserves moral consideration. Why shouldn\u2019t \u201chumans\u201d be killed? To a terminally ill cancer patient desperate for death from the constant pain, shouldn\u2019t we grant them a medically assisted suicide? To a elderly person ready to die and also at risk of brain damage, is a DNR wrong to give them? To a brain dead person kept alive only on life support, should euthanasia be denied to them if everyone close to that person supports it?\n\nThere\u2019s a billion and one examples of when people who everyone would agree are humans could be killed morally. The whole centerpiece of the debate is when things are worthy of moral consideration; you\u2019re gonna have to do a lot more work than saying \u201czygotes are human therefore human rights\u201d.",

It doesn't matter if 2 adults agree that they want to kill their kid. Killing a child is killing a child. You clearly don't think fetuses are living humans for some unknown reason, can you please give me a reason as to why, or perhaps a scientific source?",

Now if by blood worship you mean animal sacrifices then I get where you're coming from because that happens a lot. \n\nAnd ridiculing an entire group of people is just ridiculous. Ridiculing all Democrats because of Joe Biden is stupid and ridiculing all Republicans cause of Donald Trump is stupid.

More happens here (like Satan trying to deceive Him) but the main point I'm saying here is the Bible says \"and he was hungry\" The Bible also mentions Jesus's ability to read minds and to heal people. Showing that He was both fully God and fully human. Ofc this is assuming that the Bible is legit (which I believe it is) but that is a whole other conversation. If you have any other questions about the Bible I will gladly answer them in the best way I possibly can while also doing my best to respect your beliefs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: You're right religion and politics are two completely separate ballparks lol. I was just trying to think of areas where people who have differing views have been grouped together with people they disagree with on a view because they are part of the same group.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 2 cuz I didn't acknowledge one of your points: Yes Jesus did say drink of my blood but in the Bible the Jewish word for blood (haima) can be used for a few different things such as actual blood, it can refer to the seat of life, and can refer to things that resemble blood (namely grape juice) When Jesus said drink of my blood he wasn't referring to his own blood but more likely rather to drinking grape juice representing his blood. (Also yes I know Catholics believe the grape juice in Communion turns into Jesus' blood, simply put I'm not Catholic) \n\nSource: [https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g129/kjv/tr/0-1/](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g129/kjv/tr/0-1/)",

A forced miscarriage through a poisonous substance that causes it is literally an abortion. Whether she was unfaithful or not doesn't enter into it. If she was pregnant and miscarriages because she drank a toxic substance, that is abortion. You have to understand these were simpler people, most of whom didn't fully understand the intricacies of the biology of pregnancy, other than when a women shows and that it has to do with heterosexual intercourse. She could be pregnant and not show for months, only to be accused of it later when she did begin to show.",

In which case none of this matters and you have no free will because you act as God decided as he chose how to make you knowing what the results would be (If he knows your journey in advance, he could change it because he made you how you are. \n\nOn top of that, your god acts like an angry 13 year old going through puberty. By the bibles own claim that \u201cyour heavenly father is perfect.\u201d Yet, numerous instances in the bible of God being a sociopath. Seems weird to be so emotional for a \u201cperfect\u201d being. \n\nI choose to believe in no God rather than a God as bi-polar as the Christian one. \n\nNo one will ever convince you, because you believe without proof or evidence. The reason most don\u2019t like to converse with Christians is because they substitute \u201cbelief\u201d for logic in many other areas of life. \n\nThis isn\u2019t even touching on the political differences. It\u2019s a long list.",

Point is, you don't get to hand waive away parts of the Bible away as \"book of laws\" that only apply to Jews when it's convenient for you, then turn around and use literally the same book to try and lord over people in how they live their own lives in a modern society. You don't get to have it both ways. If you want to draw inspiration from it for your own life, that's fine, but the rest of us are sick of being held back as a society because some goat herders and nomads told some stories a couple thousand years ago. I could give two shits if someone wants to live their life according to what they read in Harry Potter, so long as they don't try to push that belief set on me.",

Also the reason I specifically said Jews is due to some of the things Paul says in the New Testament while writing to churches he basically says that the Old Testament Laws only apply to Jews (for the most part there are obviously some things in the Old Testament that apply to both Jews and non Jews such as the Ten Commandments) through telling them not to have idle arguments like those of whether Christians have to be circumsized (curcumsized, curcimsized? screw it lol)  or not.  As for the Numbers 5 thing, I do have to say its a strong argument and one hard to argue against, but its a test of faithfulness, they didn't drink the stuff to kill the baby, they did it to test the wife's loyalty towards her husband. Also I recommend you look at Blue Letter Bible for some more exact translation on what we see in the Bible. It never says that the woman will have a miscarriage, but rather that more exactly translated \"Her abdomen will swell and her thigh shall fall\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not an expert at Hebrew just translated it using a resource I know about so if it's wrong I'm sorry lol",

In places where you aren't allowed to have abortions, you find more kids that grew up poor and that were raised by parents that weren't ready to be parents. Basically, these people aren't ok with abortion, but they are ok with sending a kid into this world even if they will clearly have a more miserable life. They are quick to stop abortions but reluctant to want to support children in need.",

She wholeheartedly believes the government should have every right to require you to vaccinate if you\u2019re gonna work in medical fields, schools, food and service industries as well as any other employment fields that are a necessity. \n\nListen it\u2019s been fun laughing at another plague rat flounder around pretending they are making some kind of valid point while also basking in their own victim mentality but I\u2019ve got better things to do with my time. You have fun infecting other innocent people and enjoy that future Herman Cain award there champ. Now scamper on back to the sewer.",

You\u2019d never know an employee went through an abortion unless she had some obvious physical or emotional complications.\n\nAn abortion might make you uncomfortable, but that\u2019s because of your own differing morals. The abortion has no effect on public health. On the other hand, COVID is very contagious. Depending on the job, there can be huge implications to everyone at work if an employee comes in with COVID. To protect everyone\u2019s health, it\u2019s logical for an employer to only hire vaccinated people. If an abortion had the same implications as COVID, I believe it would get a similar treatment.",

Life Before Birth. 2nd ed. England: Mosby-Wolfe, 1996, p.31] \n\nIn light of the biological evidence and philosophical arguments discussed herein, it is most reasonable to support the notion that personhood status is present at the point of human fertilization. Source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5499222/\n\nHuman development begins after the union of male and female gametes or germ cells during a process known as fertilization (conception). Fertilization is a sequence of events that begins with the contact of a sperm (spermatozoon) with a secondary oocyte (ovum) and ends with the fusion of their pronuclei (the haploid nuclei of the sperm and ovum) and the mingling of their chromosomes to form a new cell.

Life Before Birth. 2nd ed. England: Mosby-Wolfe, 1996, p.31]\nIn light of the biological evidence and philosophical arguments discussed herein, it is most reasonable to support the notion that personhood status is present at the point of human fertilization. Source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5499222/\n> Human development begins after the union of male and female gametes or germ cells during a process known as fertilization (conception). Fertilization is a sequence of events that begins with the contact of a sperm (spermatozoon) with a secondary oocyte (ovum) and ends with the fusion of their pronuclei (the haploid nuclei of the sperm and ovum) and the mingling of their chromosomes to form a new cell. This fertilized ovum, known as a zygote, is a large diploid cell that is the beginning, or primordium, of a human being.\"[Moore, Keith L. Essentials of Human Embryology. Toronto: B.C.

I thought it could prevent implantation (after fertilization), but I've just read that that is disputed by the manufacturer but the FDA still requires it on the label. That's messed up.\n\nFrom verywellhealth.com: \"Even though there was no scientific proof that Plan B works by preventing eggs from implanting, this claim was still included by the FDA on the drug\u2019s label.\"",

According to Catholic beliefs, once the sperm enters the egg, before contact with the uterine wall, and before even a single cell division, that fertilized egg is already a full, living human being with an eternal soul.  Therefore, any procedure or drug used specifically to prevent that egg from attaching to the uterus would constitute an abortion.",

Abortions mostly are one-off occurrences  done for medical reasons compared to any other reason, almost half. Also, she is firing back a person who didn't even have an abortion, that we know of. All of this information is widely available in the CDC's abortion statistics on the website.\n\n  \nOn a final note, in my experience, pro-life people are almost never silent about being pro-life. They are exceptionally louder. This is from someone who has lived in both very red and very blue areas.",

If the female HAS to bear the child then men do not feel as guilty for leaving, (blaming it on the law)\n\nThis is why  should have the right to an abortion\n\nBecause if women have the right to have an abortion, then males *also have the right to not care for the child. Since both are (usually) a choice. And if you don't know what that choice is, it's called Sex.\n\nAnd to be honest, if someone does not want that child, then they don't exactly have an emotional connection to it...\n\nWhich is also why too much Porn consumption can lead to teens not understanding what is and isn't sex with an emotional connection.",

For guys its because they don\u2019t get play and want to shame women who are out there  being promiscuous making free choices with their own body, and for women its because they see women having a good time doing themselves and want that. Its always either insecurity or jealousy because I guarantee this girl wouldn\u2019t raise a kid she got from a random one night stand and especially wouldn\u2019t if god forbid she were attacked by a stranger. \n\nA prolife mindset is a very childish and closeminded view of the world, if you care so much about those kids that aren\u2019t aborted start a foster care because thats usually where kids whos parents didn\u2019t want to go through with it end up. The system is flooded with kids, who feel unloved and will feel unloved their entire life, me personally i would rather not have to do life if it meant my situation was automatically gonna make every aspect of my life difficult from beginning to end or if i knew the people who brought me here have no desire to love me or raise me the way im deserved to as a human being. Bringing kids up in an environment they aren\u2019t welcomed is way worse than not ever knowing that was a thing.",

If you wanna have kids that's great but it's a narrow pov to hold especially to someone who isn't in a financial position to have a child. Also 9 months of being pregnant I imagine is not easy so I wouldn't want a women who isn't prepared to go through that to have to go through that. Now with that being said, if your okay with the government controlling what you can do with your body, go for it. Just don't complain about women's rights or any of that shit because your forfeiting that when your allowing the government to make choices about what you can do with your body.",

Something as simple as a phone tells me they can afford the child, I'm talking in extreme cases where the baby would have to grow up going days without food kind of extreme. But even if you're scummy enough to abort your child and you can afford to raise them telling anyone what you did should be the very very last thing you'd ever want to do besides the abortion itself obviously.",

It didn\u2019t actually terminate a pregnancy. So, get your facts straight before you post a really irritating rant. Second, all you antiabortion cultists seem to only care about the fetus when it\u2019s still in the womb. But, y\u2019all never really think about the financial difficulties that parents face to ensure their child has the quality of life that they need. So, before going on your little irritating rant, do some research about what it takes to raise a child for 18 years and that there are many people in this country who can\u2019t handle the financial burden of it. Also, again, you were going on an anti-abortion rant on a video that is referencing a pregnancy from being prevented, not terminated. So, kindly shut the fuck up.",

I think one of the lowest forms of human are the humans who force their religion and beliefs on other people. These lowly and worthless human think that they have the moral high ground and it\u2019s their responsibility to restrict others from their rights based on their interpretation of Christianity. \n\nThe christofascists have been planning the downfall of freedom and democracy in America for a long time. They\u2019ve created such a divide that we are at the beginning of another civil war. Republican politicians have weaponized the ignorance of the uneducated and those brainwashed by Christianity. Taking advantage of their constituents generational poverty, racism and lack of education to create a platform of hate masquerading as faith and morality to take our rights. They say it\u2019s the illegals, the gays, the trans and women who are degrading the morality of our country and the way to stop this is to put prayer and moral back into our schoolS and homes. This is so they can indoctrinate the next generation because according to them you can\u2019t have a successful society without a Christian majority. And nobody saw a problem with this even though this is a exactly how the third reich started. Christofascists and their regime leaders have been planning this for 50 years and we laughed and made jokes about it never happening. \n\nWhen history writes itself they will be seen exactly like Hitler and Mussolini. They\u2019ll find themselves in the world courts being convicted of crimes against humanity, murder, manslaughter, accessories etc. But they won\u2019t be able to say they were just following orders because it\u2019s their religion and their actual beliefs. Their videos and posts from all over the internet will be used as evidence. They\u2019ll say they were brainwashed and blame FoxNews or their parents. This time they won\u2019t be able to deny it or say they were just following orders. But by then it\u2019ll be too late",

To reduce that down to \"Abortion is literally murder\" is just about the dumbest fucking statement you could make, and unfortunately, it seems to be prevailing among a certain demographic of knuckle-dragging, mouth-breathing dipshits who don't understand science, worship zombies, and think reality TV stars make great leaders of the free world.   \n\nYou're fucking dumb is what I'm trying to tell you.",

If someone is vehemently anti-abortion but also anti-contraceptive then they're a hypocrite. They want to live in a make-believe world where legislation against those things and teaching total abstinence works when all available evidence says otherwise.\n\n Also, they take zero time to understand our arguments or treat us like human beings. I've never been in an argument with a forced birther where they didn't resort to name-calling and invoking religion to tell me how much better they are than me. This is a big problem with democrats right now: people like Biden think right wingers are interested in having a dialogue when they're not. They don't treat us with respect so why should we go out of our way to be civil with them?",

Why do you think this woman is confusing Plan B with abortion? \n\n>For example, you saying that they probably believe condoms are abortion is wrong. They, for the most part, believe life begins at conception and condoms prevent conception. If you say something like that to them then it proves (in their mind) that you\u2019re wrong and they\u2019re right.\n\nMany of them do believe things like that. Have you looked at the Catholic church's official stance on contraceptives lately? \"Intrinsically evil\" is the term used. What about the Moral Majority's thoughts on contraceptives?\n\nI've had these conversations many, many times. I've been polite. I've provided sources. They don't care, because much of the cause isn't about \"saving babies.\" It's about moralizing and control.\n\nOne guy outright told me that he doesn't care if abortion rates go down as long as it's illegal and the women/healthcare workers are punished.

That child has a right to life, nobody has the right to murder. \n\n\nI\u2019ll save us some time.\n\nThis is where you say: it\u2019s not a child it\u2019s a clump of cells. \n\nOr something to that effect. \n\nTo which I would point out that throughout human history, every atrocity has been committed under the premise that those subject to the atrocity are not human and therefore the atrocity is morally acceptable. Dehumanizing arguments are a way to emotionally detach from a subject in order to engage in a monstrous act. Examples, settlers used the reasoning that Native Americans were not people but savages therefore it was morally acceptable to commit genocide and steal their land. Slavers used the reasoning that slaves were only 3/5ths a person and therefore it was okay to treat human beings like property. Nazis used the reasoning that Jews were vermin and therefore genocide was acceptable. And pro-abortion advocates, such as yourself, use the reasoning that because the baby is not fully developed, it is just a clump of cells (some actually call it a parasite and those people disgust me) and therefore killing it is acceptable. \n\nYou will then claim that a fetus is not alive or discuss the socio-economic or environmental impacts of a reduction of population or quality of life only for me to say the outcome is irrelevant if we have to murder each other to do it. \n\nUltimately, a choice was made to engage in consensual sex with the understanding that it could lead to pregnancy. If you\u2019re going to have sex, contraceptive options are abundant and affordable, and while not 100% foolproof, significantly reduce the likelihood of an unwanted pregnancy. For 100% effectiveness, there\u2019s always abstinence but that\u2019s not realistic. \n\nAs for the fetus is not alive argument, I am willing to concede that prior to six weeks, when it does not have a heartbeat, it is not alive by medical standards, but personally, I believe life begins at conception.",

If you need a kidney or you die, for example, unless someone consents to you having their kidney, you die. Simple as that.

If you don\u2019t want B, don\u2019t sign the contract. You sign the contract because you want A, and B happens. Cue surprised pikachu face. \n\nThe fetus being alive is completely relevant as killing humans that are alive is called murder. And murder is bad. No human has the right to murder.

No.  The term \u201cfetus\u201d has been used by abortion supporters to de-humanize the unborn developing human.  When does this magical \u201cfetus\u201d suddenly become \u201chuman\u201d?  The logic behind \u201cfetus\u201d is absent and arbitrary.\n\n2) Mothers expecting a child should be able to count the unborn human as part of the census.  The only reason they are not is merely convention.\n\n3) Miscarriages can result in funerals.  My sister-in-law and brother had 2 private funerals for their unborn children that died in the womb (non viable).\n\n4) Two children and one on the way is equivalent to 3 children.\n\n5) Life does begin at conception AND implantation.  An unfertilized egg implanted will not produce a human.  A fertilized egg (embryo) not implanted will not produce a human.  This is why IVF embryos are not human\u2014they will never be a human without the host.  If technology makes artificial wombs in the future, we may have to reconsider.\n\n5) Carbon alone doesn\u2019t make a human.  Silly statement.\n\n6) If the phone startled Daddy into squirting into Mommy, then they are both responsible for the outcome, however unintended.  Their behavior (intercourse) determined the outcome (along with the phone).\n\n7) Fertilized eggs are flushed from the female body all the time.  Correct.  Nature has it\u2019s own mechanisms of aborting a human and those same mechanisms should not be employed via some future technology to abort an implanted human.\n\n8) Sperm, by definition, is not capable of becoming a human.\n\n9) Homosexuals and Abortion are two unrelated issues.\n\n10) The economics surrounding pregnancy are no different than many other life circumstances that humans encounter.  Just because someone says \u201cI can\u2019t afford it\u201d does not permit extermination of human life.  Personal responsibility is fundamental for controlling and dealing with outcomes from all reproductive behavior.",

      "text": "I remember in school during a biology class, watching a video on abortion, and it actually showed a abortion in progress. I don't know if it's done differently nowadays, I hope it is, but the 'procedure' if you can call it that amounted to what looked like a mini vacuum cleaner tube, inserted I can only imagine was up through the female genitalia, into the womb, at which point the 'hoover tube' was turned on. What happened next has scared me to this day. Which is why I'm able to remember that video and class so vividly and can type about it now. It literally just tore the young life, limb from limb. My mate at the time, sat next to me, we were the class jokers. But being quite intelligent also, we got away with lot. Anyway, we just turned to look at each other, both our jaws just there swinging uselessly, shocked to our core. Our teacher didn't warn us of the horror we were about to see, as to really hit home the gravity of the decision to have an abortion. It was part of our sex education syllabus and I think they wanted to ram home what the consequences of having unprotected sex could lead to. It was an all male, grant-mantained secondary school which meant they received their funding straight from central government and not the local authority.  It gave them more control over what they did as a school, and was the first in the country (UK) to go it alone and break away from local control. It was and still is a bloody good school and was massively focused on sports and education. The sporting prowess it nationwide is what attracted me. But the education was outstanding. Anyway, you wouldn't get schools doing lessons like that anymore, which is a real shame. Because as sad and as graphic as that lesson was, it educated me more than what any teacher could do, trying to explain to a room full of teenage lads, what abortion entailed.",

According to this site[verywellfamily.com](https://www.verywellfamily.com/does-lying-on-your-back-after-sex-help-with-conception-1960291#toc-overview), fertilization/conception can happen as soon as few minutes after sex. So assuming the fertilization happened that quickly, which is entirely possible, the plan b would act as an abortifacient. Plan B, put very simply, tricks the woman\u2019s body into thinking it\u2019s pregnant. The body would view the fetus that\u2019s already been conceived as a threat or something that shouldn\u2019t be there, and would commence to attack it, and of course kill it. To be clear, I\u2019m not an expert, I happen to know just enough basic info on this subject. Also I don\u2019t mean any disrespect, so if this post comes across as mean or condescending or anything, I do apologize, as that\u2019s genuinely not my intent.

That shit fucked my mom up to this day. Yeah she's \"over it\" but having an abusive childhood with drug addict parents has left her mentally damaged.

Every child deserves good parents. But not every parent deserves their child. I've had friends that said they wished their mom would have aported them because of their childhood. And their mother wouldn't of had to struggle so hard. Again these are the consequences you agree to when you are shouting pro-life.

That means they are depending on someone else's *ongoing consent.* When that consent is withdrawn, there is no recourse. \n\nImagine the following:\n\nJohn goes out drinking, and makes a bad call to drive drunk. He hits Jane with his car. He wakes up the next morning strapped to a hospital bed. There are tubes connecting his body to Jane's. The doctors say that in this insanely unlikely scenario, he has to make continuous blood donations to Jane for the next 9 months, or she will die. \n\nBodily autonomy means *John does not have to save Jane.* He can get up off that table and leave. He made a choice to drive drunk, but legally speaking, that mistake does not obligate him to give Jane his blood. He might have to pay her money, or go to jail, or lose his license for the crime of driving drunk... but no one can force him to give blood. \n\nPregnancy is the same thing. (Except you can't criminalize sex.)\n\nBodily autonomy doesn't mean \"you get to do whatever you want.\" It doesn't mean \"you always get your way.\" It means no one can take anything from your body to use for someone else without your consent, *even if it means someone will die as a result.* End of story.",

Bottom line, I don't believe in abortion but I sure as hell wouldn't tell someone what they can do with their own body. I forgot, I think the redhead with the attitude is pretty cute.",

The real question is which situation is worse, a fetus with no life experience and no feelings dying, or a child with some life experiences and a lot of feelings dying (of leukemia for instance) or an elderly person with a lot of life experiences and feelings dying after decades of bodily deterioration. \n\nSee what people seem to forget when they\u2019re trying to get pregnant, is that all people die a random death if you make them. We\u2019ve convinced ourselves that, somehow, those events aren\u2019t causally connected, but how can they *not* be? Everyone agrees all people die, but no one\u2019s seems to agree that this is *thus* something the parents enable to happen. \n\nSo it seems to me that abortion is a far lesser crime, if it can even be called that, than being responsible for a living person dying.",

It's human nature to mainly think about the good stuff, because otherwise we can't cope. But if we're honest then nature is basically one big slaughter where animals mercilessly kill to survive.\n\nHumans fare better of course. We have a more inclusive society where we, at least in principle, try to keep each other healthy and happy. But even within our species truly horrific things happen, things we shouldn't ignore when contemplating these topics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Edit: I\u2019ve also had a very traumatic life, so please don\u2019t preach to me about me looking through rose-tinted glasses. You can look through my history on here if you want. I\u2019ve had immediate family deaths, emotional abuse from my father, and numerous other things that have occurred in my life that are extremely painful.\n\nFair enough and thanks for your candor. But allow me to use this as an example. Because I totally get that if asked the question wether or not you would want to live your specific life instead of not existing, you would answer with 'yes' (probably). However, my point here is that you may reconsider if you were asked the same question, but it's not you living that life, but someone else. Humans being wondrous wouldn't cut it as a reason for having someone else forcibly live trough the things you've lived trough.\n\nI also want to point out that when talking about nonexistence people often confuse it with dying. It's one thing to ask someone if they'd rather not exist, but a another thing when we're talking about nonexistent people remaining nonexistent. And whenever people think nonexistence is a bad thing and would therefore choose existence, it would be good to point out that the period before birth wasn't that bad, nor will the period after death be. And if people really think nonexistence is bad, then I don't know how they're going to cope, knowing that will be their state for forever, together with infinite other nonexistent beings.  \n\n\nIn short: Loving/telerating life is perfectly fine, thinking nature is beautiful is totally fine. Deciding for another person to live because of the two former things, is problematic, because they might not like life or think nature is beautiful. And since they cannot experience the absence of life, there's no harm in not creating them.",

Read up on [optimism bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimism_bias) and [rosy retrospection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosy_retrospection). People actually have to strain themselves to see the bad thins. And that makes evolutionary sense.

It's all about *you.*\n\nWhich is understandable, because there's no other reason. Wanting to create new people and wanting new people to be created by others, can only come from your personal needs. It can never come from the need of the yet to be created. So, whatever happens to a life created, the reasons for that life are fundamentally selfish of the creator. A child dying of leukemia is only experiencing that horror because the parents selfishly wanted their needs fulfilled.",

If a woman is sexually assaulted and ends up pregnant, certainly can't expect her to carry that child. However, no, abortion shouldn't be used as birth control. That's not what it was meant for to begin with. If you can't practise safe sex then bare the responsibility of your own actions. Practise self-responsibility first.",
