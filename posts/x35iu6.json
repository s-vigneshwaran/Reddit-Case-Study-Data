  "text": "TIFU / My (20F) girlfriend of two years told me the music that I (25M) play during sex is weird and a major turn off\n\nA little back story; when I first started having sex I researched into ways to be better as I was a little stiff and pretty much had no idea what I was doing. I read online that you can play music and match the rhythm in order to put on a better performance.\n\nI searched love making songs and started slowly creating a playlist in which I was comfortable matching the rhythm.\n\nThere are a few songs to my playlist. However there is one song in particular, which actually happens to be my favourite, that my girlfriend hates and says turns her off in a major way. \n\nI don\u2019t understand why it has taken her two years to tell me she hates that song, it\u2019s a good love making song with good rhythm. I feel the way I fucked up is I could have possibly asked her previously if she likes the playlist or any songs she\u2019d like to add/change. But to leave it for two years thinking our sex life is great but in her eyes has just been ruined by my music has left the whole situation feeling awkward and I\u2019m a bit annoyed. \n\nI pretty much played this tune every single time so the amount of times she must have not been enjoying it, when I thought the complete opposite is annoying but also embarrassing in ways. \n\nNot to mention my previous partners, however they never complained about the song so maybe it\u2019s just her?\n\nIt\u2019s fucked up the relationship tbh because sex feels awkward now. The other day we were having sex with no music but I was still thrusting to the tune playing in my head. She recognised this and asked me to stop.  \n\nI thought this song was perfect and I always thrust along with the tune and feel it gives me the perfect rhythm for doing the deed to. I usually bust to this song and find it devastating she hates the song. \n\n[the song itself](https://youtu.be/KAwyWkksXuo)\n\nTL;DR She hates my love making tunes and didn\u2019t tell me for over two years making sex now awkward.",

This song sounds like it would play in the scene in a movie where everyone is doing drugs and partying but things somehow start going bad for the main characters. Definitely not a sexy song at all, and depending on the quality of his speakers those high tones would get obnoxious af to listen to regularly. This is a song i wouldn't want to hear more frequently than like every 6 months.\n\nOP, ask your girl what music she likes *AND* ask what kind of thrusting rhythm feels good to her. Focus on her preferences for awhile, because if you can cum to this song I have no doubt that you'll be able to cum no matter what.",

Every single song was somber and I felt like I was listening to a breakup mix or a playlist for someone's funeral.  Once I got to Evanescence's \"My Immortal\" was when I turned it off because it turned *me* off.  \n\nNeedless to say that I chose to thank my friend and spare his feelings instead of tell him the entire truth.  One thing I *did* do was remark how \"I never considered 'My Immortal' a love making song.\"  And he told me that it was his absolute favorite.  : (",

Are they noticing I totally skipped out with my brain?\n\nFocussing on the rhythm of the music, following that and focussing on how that feels tends to pull me straight back in like no other tool can. \n\nI lose track for at most a few seconds and wont be focussing on the music for the rest of the deed. It also only happens when I am on top/taking the leed in some other way.\n\nOn occasion I did have to stop mid sex to change a song or bc a song just ruined the sexual mood. I also recall an add for spotify if I wanted to go back to premium that got both me and my bed partner laughing our arses off mids sex once.\n\nEdit: OPs song is one of those that would stop the sex if it came up.

My now ex-husband had been insanely pushy in the bedroom and I felt absolutely voiceless, to the point of crying most times after we had sex before things died out entirely. Turns out feeling used for sex isn't the best way to keep a marriage going! And my ex would get frustrated at me for not speaking up more, yet ignore me when I told him what I wanted/didn't want, get annoyed when I told him I needed more foreplay but couldn't spell out exactly what that meant... it was a nightmare.\n\nI was talking it out to my mom once, and she started talking about how sex was an obligation to keep your husband happy, of course it was miserable but we women had to suffer through it because they (men) took care of us in so many other ways. I remember the sudden wave of pity for her at how miserable she sounded and how much she was missing out on, and for myself for realizing the reason (or at least one of them) as to why I'd been struggling so much. I never had a leg to stand on. At least I found out when I was 17 that women were able to orgasm. Not sure others in my family were so lucky lol.\n\nMy bf, incredible man that he is, has been working with me for quite a while in helping me find my voice. In a much better place now, and I like popping around on here and talking to girls who are where I was. I'm sorry you went through similar, but glad to have the affirmation that it's just how some of us are raised.",

What Music others enjoy and in what context is entirely subjective as well and can only be known if they make it known\n\nWe learn what music is \"generally\" accepted in certain contexts by our experiences, although it might differ from person to person. You could say: \"Metal\" can be played at a party for some people, but not for others. The sample sizes is the parties you were actually at. Your sample size of \"Music acceptable during sex\" is all the music we heard during sex, which basically means: \"The music you play\". So you probably have a way narrower sample size than \"Music during party\". This is about a very specific situation between only 2 people. Those 2 people have easy communication and are the only ones judging the music. With no prescedent set for how sex music \"has to sound\" OP is completely fine picking what he thinks would be good. If there is no objection voiced, there can criticism be made!\n\nWho are you to decide what other people listen to during sex, what's your sample size? What else would you consider \"wrong love-making-music\"? Metal? Rock? Rap? Jazz? I bet my ass you could find people having sex to ANY type of Genre.\n\nAll of that is entirely divorced from the fact that i (personally) find the music extremely stupid, funny and unfitting.",

You may not like it and i may not like it, but if OP likes it and thought it was fitting he can not be blamed, if no person ever mentioned they didn't like it. I could even point to the 99% Upvotes the track has on youtube. You can't just say \"It's bad\" and pretend that's just a fact and argue from there. \n\nAlso tastes differ when it comes to application of music: I like to listen to jazz when cooking, my girlfriend doesn't dislike jazz, but she doesn't like to listen to it while cooking. Also there are people who think jazz sounds \"bad\".\n\nI also listen to [this](https://youtu.be/XAkD_Cm_Mps?t=127) and find it really stimulating, while others will just perceive noise.\n\nYour entire logic is based on your subjective perception of music and certain social norms and i find it said how many people agree with you, seemingly simply on the basis of \"We also don't like this song\" instead of realizing that that's not what my point is. I also think the track is whack, but perception of art is vastly different and personal.",

That can also be characterized as a lack of empathy or emotional intelligence.\n\nEmpathy literally just means being able to put yourself in the shoes of another person.\n\nAlso, society raises us with certain standards for what specific \"types\" of music ought to sound like.  Obviously, we aren't bound by these rules, but anyone who watched TV growing up, knows that stereotypical love-making was associated with stuff like slow grooves, soul music, jazz, etc.\n\nUnless you grew up on a different planet or were severely sheltered as a kid, there's no way that this would be anyone's go-to music for sex.  If you know your partner is into the same avante-garde shit that you are?  Maybe, but you can't make huge assumptions like that.  \n\nIt'd be like if my partner asked me to dress sexy, and I came in wearing a giraffe costume.  Maybe it's sexy based on my own preferences, but I should also fucking know better, lol.",

You are creating a version of what YOUR mind thinks another person thinks. We call the people empathetic, where their version seems to match with what that person actually thinks and we gauge that by looking at expected reaction to actual reaction. You can never perceive other than with your senses. Your perception is always your own. This is utter bedrock of Epistemology and a hard problem of philosophy.",

They are in that range. Even if you lower the range to 22, If OP was a single year younger, it's magically ok? \n\nAnd going back to what you're saying about \n\n>graduated or about to graduate from college\n\nThese two could have EASILY met in college and hit it off. \n\nI could understand this if it were a 25+ year old man when she was 18. They aren't naturally meeting through a college class or something. But he's 23. \n\n>Have you ever wondered why you almost never hear about a 23+ year old woman dating a 16-18 year old boy, yet it\u2019s fairly common for the opposite to happen?\n\nIt might be because I've been to a cougar bar called Johnny's in ATL but they most definitely bragged about getting with a young Adonis on some sports team.\n\nAgain, I don't really get it. These two could have easily met at college and became friends. You're not carding everyone you meet at college. They aren't separating the seniors from the freshman because everyone is an adult.

The 23 year old has had 5 years already in that range. Puberty often lasts between 11 years old and 17 years old, does that mean a 17 year old and an 11 year old are at the same place puberty-wise? No. One is on one end of the spectrum, the other is on the opposite end. \n\nNo, 22 years old is still weird. I personally think 21 years is the soft cutoff. 18 and 20 years old is okay, 18 and 21 is edging on weird, depending on how and when you met. 19 and 21 is most likely fine. 19 and 22 is probably fine. 19 and 23 is getting weird again. \n\nIt\u2019s about life experiences. There\u2019s a huge difference between an 18 year old arriving on a college campus for the first time and a 23 year old in the process of graduating. \n\nSo the ONLY reason you hear about older women dating younger men is because you frequent a COUGAR bar\u2026 I mean, that alone speaks for itself, and it\u2019s still really fucking weird when women do it. \n\nWhat do you mean they aren\u2019t separating the seniors from the freshman? Sure, as a freshman you might end up with a single senior in your class, but 99% of your classes are going to be with other freshman, MAYBE some sophomores. Even at parties, freshman mostly mix with freshman and sophomores, not so much seniors. There\u2019s a reason graduate students don\u2019t hang out with freshman and sophomores either. There\u2019s a big age and experience gap. \n\nIf 18 year old were seen as adults, why can\u2019t they legally drink or smoke?",

My gen Ed classes were full of people of all ranges. Not just freshman or sophomores. What you're saying sounds more like high school.\n\nAnd I also disagree with the parties thing? We definitely didn't separate by age lol. The only senior freshman separation thing was the seniors who wanted to go to the bar afterwards. \n\nI'll agree to disagree but the fact that I could have easily socialized with 22 and 23 year olds when I was 18 in my college classes is why I don't think this is weird at all. If it was high school it'd be weird and we'd be separated of course, but for college I just can't agree. \n\n**Also I do wanna say 18 was the start of my hoe phase** because 1.away from parents 2.

I like Kendrick, not the biggest fan of Daft Punk. I don't know who James Blake is.

I'm not impressed by Grammys it's doesn't affect me one bit. Just like i abhor influencers, just because one is known does not automatically impress me.",

I find music to be a great tool to keep the mood but I primarily use it as a cover up out of courtesy for housemates. If you focus on her pleasure and doing things she likes you'll have a much better time for sure.",

See it from her point of view - first time having sex with someone is probably too nerve-wracking / potentially awkward to mention it. Then the next few times she\u2019s too caught up in the excitement of a new relationship. Then after that she\u2019s thinking \u201ccrap, it\u2019s been this long. It\u2019s too late now\u201d.

It's not my jam, but if this song is what you enjoy OP, that's fine, you do you.\n\nThat said, have you considered playing something even remotely romantic instead? Because man, what on earth is your poor gf supposed to think if she's having to listen to that every time you get it on? The first sounds made me think about the noise that tortoise makes when it's laying pipe, you know the video.\n\nAs much as this is a FU, it is also a good opportunity. This is your chance to go away and make an *actual* playlist for her. Fill it with songs that express how you feel about her, maybe even songs that reference stupid goofy things that you joke about in your relationship (although given the evidence so far, maybe steer clear of these for now). Making custom playlists for someone is a really nice thing to do (and fun, but that just might be me that finds it fun), and genuinely quite romantic in a relationship if done right (there's a reason it used to be a common thing back in the days of physical music). \n\nKey point: this is not a sex playlist. This is a *love* playlist. The goal is not a playlist to smash to, the goal is to create a playlist that is made out of the fabric of your relationship. One that you listen to when one of you is out of town just to feel close to each other (that was one of the most mushy things I've ever typed). \n\nAlso: if you do make a sex playlist, put it on shuffle and make it long enough that you're not listening to the same damn songs every time.",

I can say that it took me some time at that age to feel confident in speaking my mind instead of doing things just to please others. I see that there was a communication breakdown between you both and neither of you is fully to blame. \n\nTake this as an opportunity to discuss each other's needs and expectations.

What reactions from her turn you on? Sex doesn't have to be a performance, it can just be the two of you giving eachother pleasure and enjoying the moment.",

When I first started dating my wife I'd play my music low in the background but it wasn't until years later (post the honeymoon stage) that she finally told me she really didn't care for music while we f**ked. I appreciated the honesty and it really was no big deal to me.\n\n\nIt sounds like you guys are past that \"honeymoon\" phase of your relationship when you start arguing a little more and at the same time become more matter of fact with things you like or dont like in your relationship. Its a good thing. Do you really need music? When I was younger (your age) I thought I did, now music during sex is just cheesy to me. Again, just my opinion.",

It definitely would be annoying and hurtful to know she never once brought it up, I would ask her why she didn\u2019t\n3. Is there a pattern of her avoiding you guys problems, if so it may be because she doesn\u2019t trust you will take her seriously or change when she works up the courage to tell you them. May not be the case, just food for thought. \n4. Having sex to a beat is a bad idea because the tempo you need is constantly changing. It\u2019s all about getting closer to someone to the point that you can feel what they\u2019re feeling and match the pace that they want. In the short term just ask, \u201chey do you want it faster/slower\u201d let her know you\u2019re gonna be asking what she wants, and tell her to tell you what she wants that way it\u2019s not just you constantly asking. \n5. Music should be used for mood only, and it can do that part really good. Someone had the great suggestion of having her create an entire playlist of her own. When she plays it for you you will probably find it strange based off your taste. Don\u2019t judge her for it and try to enjoy what she likes. You can let her know that it is very different from what you like but you will try to enjoy it for her. \n6. We did it to music once and I gotta say it was amazing, no I did not go to the beat, our band of choice was Two Feet. \n\nGood luck man, that\u2019s a pretty weird and hilarious story that hopefully you guys can laugh about for years. It seems she really cares about you if she suffered through that for two years.",

It's normal for us to like different things than our partner, in bed and out.  \n\nWe don't always tell our partners when something they're clearly into doesn't work for us the same way.   We have different things we like and this song is clearly yours.  It sounds like the music helps you feel more secure in your abilities, but it's not the music she's into and it's not the music that gives you your skills.  She's into you and your skills.  Have a conversation about what she doesn't like about what you do when you're listening to that song and adjust.  \n\nThis is a chance for you two to grow closer and have better sex, if you can set aside your insecurities.",

Ask her what music she'd like (if she likes music during sex) and open a conversation about what you both like/dislike. Then, plan out an amazing romantic evening for the two of you and show her some serious appreciation for her love and patience.",

Most people prefer the tempo of sex to start out slower and slowly build up over time. Also using the same song everytime takes out any suspense and completely removes the possibility of being surprised. Maybe start by having her give you cues throughout the sex the next few times. The increased communication might feel awkward and difficult but later on youll be able to guage her needs better without such direct communication. Youll have a better idea of what it is she actually wants. Not to say what you want doesnt matter as well but if you show her you care about getting her off well shes more likely to be willing and eager to do thing how you want it done now and then",

And if it took her 2 years to tell you that she doesn't like your shitty ass music, I can only imagine what else she dislikes about your sex life, that she hasn't found it in herself to tell you yet.\n\nI would think that a 25 year old would have the emotional maturity to reach that conclusion without the need to make a Reddit post and have others tell him. But instead, you're whining like a little bitch on the internet about how the sex is awkward now cause she doesn't like your song. I would also expect a 25 year old to simply say, \"ok, honey. What music would you like instead?\" And just roll with it as opposed to going to Reddit and asking the internet for validation on your choice of pedo beats, but apparently this is a real problem for you because you can only fuck to the rythm of this one song.\n\nIdk if this adds to the creepy factor of your relationship or is about what I expected when I saw the age gap and how long you'd been dating, but my advice is that you should probably break up with your GF so she can be free of this weird grooming shit you're doing to her, and so you can grow up, get some therapy, and learn how to have a healthy relationship with someone your age.",

Likely if your reaction to her being open with you is \"and now everything is ruined\" that's why she waited 2 years. Because she probably suspected, rightly as it turns out, that you were gunna react to her needs in the bedroom with making it all about you and so she buried her own needs until she ran out of dirt. \n\n Early in a relationship (like the first 2-3 years your brain is suffused with a very powerful chemical that puts rose colored glasses on your face and everything that should annoy the ever living hell out of you is ignorable or written off as \"cute\" problem is it physically does not last. Long relationships involve constant renegotiations and falling into that \"crazy about you\" stage over and over again with the same person. She probably didn't mind it as much in the beginning, she probably found it endearing or cute in a dumb way... But once it keeps being a thing and there's no sign of this just being a phase for you she probably dug herself deeper when it became appearant that the song was there to stay.\n\nTake it as a lesson and move on.",

Especially if it's used almost every time and you usually \"finish\" to it.\n\nI feel like I can understand where your line of thinking started, and the advice was solid initially when everything is awkward for both parties when you're younger. That being said, I feel like as you get older it's important to recognize that every partner is different, and that tempo should be based more off of your partner and your synergy together than off a bassline.\n\nIf it's that important to you you could just keep looking until you find someone who legitimately enjoys that specific tempo and your Playlist to match it, but understand that if you decide to go that route it will greatly narrow your list of potential connections.\n\nJust my personal opinion though.",

Then afterwards ask her how she felt about the playlist, then about the one particular song you threw in there she didn't already now about and see how she feels. Adjust accordingly for the future.\n\nBut seriously talk about your sex life, before, during, and after. And during I don't mean dirty talk (though that is a very good thing to get comfortable with), but when there's a break, a lull, a pause to catch your breath or change up something, mention what's going right, what's working well.\n\nHave fun.",

It shows absolutely no thought is going into what you do to her, you simply plod along robotically, performing the same moves at the same pace every single time. \n\nHere's a suggestion - stop thinking about what you're doing during sex and pay attention to the noises SHE'S making, not the godawful sounds of that song. Read her noises, movements, breathing. I can promise you that if you're spending the whole time concentrating on that damn song and making sure you're in time with it, you're not paying any attention to her, and ironically the thing you thought would make you better at sex is making you worse. All it takes is focusing on what your partner wants instead of yourself. That's it!\n\nSide note - I find it hilarious that the YouTube comment section of that song now references this post, and I'm imagining how confused ppl will be if they read it and haven't seen this \ud83d\ude02",

But to leave it for two years...\";*\n\nReminds me of an amusing/frustrating situation related by a couple I know. My friend married a Brazilian woman. In the area where she is from, there is a word or phrase commonly interjected in conversation which to someone who is learning academic Brazilian Portuguese either literally means no or otherwise sounds like disagreement. However, in real-world usage in her hometown it means yes or agreement. Result: for the first five years of his marriage, he frequently thought he and his wife were in disagreement when, in fact, they were not. This period included having their first child! Can you imagine the distress he went through all those years?!",

Its one thing to be listening to music you mutually like together and then you guys just by chance start getting into it\u2026 its a whole other to *need* to have music to fuck. And especially the same song. I cant even listen to the same song for two years strait even if I loved it. I would get sick of it after two months. Thats just way too fucking much man. \n\nIdk just sounds like instead of actually being into the moment you turned sex into a routine. Of course thats a turn off. Stop being so focused on performing and start being focused on the two of you. If you cant then something is off. Either you, or the relationship. I mean that definitely seems like an autistic approach to a romantic relationship\u2026 so you\u2019re either on the spectrum or you guys aren\u2019t actually vibin each other.",

Her boobs are bouncing to the beat, I am being swallowed by her lips to the beat... The point I need to make before I watch that video or put on some techno music here is that techno music now pretty much makes me instantly hard.
