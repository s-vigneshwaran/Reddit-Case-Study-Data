In return, he was to be put back into stasis within the Matrix. His comment indicates that, after being in the real world for 9 years, he would have preferred to have remained ignorant of that reality. The juicy, delicious steak affirms his feelings, because there is no steak in the real world. [This also ties to his conversation with Neo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hwron4yoaUw), i.e. \"Why, oh why, didn't I take the *blue* pill?\"\n\nEDIT: Additional context and links.",

Justice except Sonia Sotomeyer whose family was born in Puerto Rico was the only dissenter and that was likely more so a more personal/political dissent that had no real legal ramifications but let her signal her own views outside of the legal matter.  \n\n\nAn easier and less legally confusing way to think of it.  Is that a Puerto Rican can become a \"full\" US citizen by going to the US and obtaining it with little to no issues in doing so.  That said a Puerto Rican living in Puerto Rico who does not even attempt to claim US citizenship (they have full access to) isn't really a citizen in the way most people would think or talk about such things in layman's terms.  \n\nThe situation with Puerto Rico and citizenship truly is a \"second class citizen\" situation and people need to understand this more than you, I, or anyone else needs to score points for being right or wrong or \"slamming\" the opposition.",

Additionally, several categories of Puerto Ricans are required to pay Federal income taxes, including members of the military, employees of the federal government, those who go business with the federal government, and some others.  There's also the sticky point that the median income in PR is below the federal poverty line, so those people wouldn't be paying income tax on that basis if they weren't otherwise exempted.  Puerto Rican citizens ARE full citizens of the USA.  They AREN'T citizens of a state, which comes with the benefit of voting for Congress/Senate/President.

If it's handled like other stuff in education guidelines they'd just get fired.\n\nWhat's more, the bill is frankly worded like absolute shit. It might be possible to get around it with how you word your lessons. Something like \"in the 1990's people from Puerto Rico were denied the vote. I'm not allowed to comment on if they're allowed to vote now.\" might be enough to teach the kids without strictly speaking breaking the law.\n\nHowever they'd probably still get fired anyway because the school board just doesn't care enough to risk it.",

A teacher may choose to add to that curriculum but I imagine most don't as that's just extra work.\n\nWhat's more, if a teacher does teach modern events they need to show both sides. The problem that hasn't really been addressed yet is - what does that even mean? Could a flat earther sue because their side of the \"debate\" on the shape of the earth isn't represented? I mean according to the bill they might have an argument there (although I imagine they'd get laughed out of court for being wacka doodles anyway), we don't know because they haven't tried yet.\n\nSo what about the modern debate on if Puerto Ricans should get a vote? What even is the \"other side\"? I mostly hear racist stuff about them not being proper Americans because they're not white, but teachers aren't allowed to teach racism so what on earth do they actually say? The easiest answer is nothing, so that's what they do.\n\nYou can still learn all about the history of the territories as long as none of the kids feel bad about it after, but when it comes to any modern political issue they're encouraged to just leave it well alone.",

That is the closest thing I can think of to a British Colonial law that the US is enforcing. It prevents foreign ships from docking at one US port and then sailing to another, they MUST stop at a foreign port first, which is EXTREMELY detrimental to Puerto Rico. They may not pay income tax, but they also have to pay twice as much for any foreign cargo.  Basically, the US is doing to PR a watered down version of what the UK did to the US in the 1700's, buy from us, or be damned.  \nEdit: I spoke incorrectly, the law stops international ships from stopping at a US port and then moving on to another US port. Still has the negative effects, just in a different method. My mistake.",

It is a non-tariff trade barrier. You know all those ships that are snarling your supply chain\u2026that is the Jones act.

If the passenger does not get back on the ship at an Alaskan port of call, the cruise line is fined and will pass that fine onto the passenger if they can.\n\nCruises from US to Hawaii just end up being domestically owned.",

In the US specifically, its pushing hard for American companies like Intel and Global Foundries to develop and manufacture computer chips here in the US and bribing foreign companies(like ASML and TSMC) to set up design and manufacturing shops here, which is almost a technology transfer because those companies will be forced to train and hire American engineers. I think most countries implementing these policies would agree that it is in their strategic national interests to have people of their own nationalities doing certain jobs because of the implications of of the chip shortage and a potential export embargo on those sorts of good. There seems to be a proper time and place for governments imposing policies that require people of their own nationality to perform certain jobs, but certainly not for everything.",

The other half are the immigrants who settle for pennies.\n\nYou see how, despite your about-face, this sentiment is real. Immigrants **are** hungry and trying to survive and the owning class is more than happy to exploit them. And instead of linking arms with immigrants and the international working class, there's a huge voting block in the US and EU that would rather imprison and torture and murder immigrants to stop them from immigrating AND they don't want their country doing anything to help the working class in those home countries. More than happy to bomb Yemen, but don't let any Yemenis come to the country. More than happy to cheer when Bolton says that the Monroe Doctrine is alive and well but don't let anyone from South America come to the US and take our jobs.\n\nThe problem is the owning class.

              "text": "Not true re: Puerto Ricans wanting to stay a territory. The 2020 referendum had a majority vote for Yes to statehood. The one in 2017 was 97% for statehood but was boycotted by the opposition. In 2012 a referendum asked if Puerto Rico should continue its status as a territory, a majority said no and for the secondary question asking what it should have if not be a territory, over 61% said statehood, 33% said free association with the US, and about 5.5% said independence.\n\nEdit: In short Puerto Ricans generally want to not be a territory and most who don't want to be such want statehood but it's blocked in congress by the Democratic Party ironically enough. The GOP has Puerto Rican statehood as a plank in their platform (not that I think they're actually in that much of a rush) and the Dems don't. Puerto Rico would be a lean right state if it were admitted so isn't advantageous to Dems, that's why they're pushing hard on DC. Who knows, maybe one day we'll see both get admitted together as a quid pro quo like how they used to admit slave and free states in pairs",

The people of US territories do not get critical government programs like expanded unemployment, Medicaid, and social security.  They also do not get representation in the federal government.  There\u2019s some other stuff about PR specifically not being allowed to go bankrupt, but I don\u2019t understand that issue enough to go into it.\n\nEventually, the people of these territories will come around.  It seems pretty clear that the Founding Fathers envisioned a growing country where newly acquired land would eventually be granted statehood.  I don\u2019t think it ever occurred to them that the US would have \u201cforever territories,\u201d and I don\u2019t think it benefits anyone in the long run.\n\nAs for the GOP fearing losing seats, perhaps they should spend less time worrying about who is allowed to vote and more time making their platform attractive to the masses.  And honestly, this is the land of political compromise.  We made a LOT of states under the Missouri Compromise.  I find it hard to believe that we cannot find a working compromise to grant representation to millions of US citizens.",

              "text": "**OOF!** *CHIEF, Imma have to give you the reality of living here on the island and not that sweet propaganda which Fox News and CNN feed you.* I'm writing from a burner, and this will be a long message, but I promise that if you read it whole you won't say the same mistakes you did ever again. I will provide a summary which doesn't do much justice to the whole text at the end for others to read.\n\nThough I understand your line of thought, reality is **VERY** different here on the island.\n\nFirst off, it's very important to state that the island does not want to stay in the current political status **AT ALL,** in fact, the political parties in the island are mainly based in what intentions do they have for the current status *(whether to join as a 51st state or be independent.... and eitherway, the decision is not up to them or us, only congress can decide, and the current colony status benefits congress much more than having PR be annexed or released)*. In fact, four referendums have been made in order to state to congress that Puerto Rico wants to become a state, but it is USA's Congress who denies or even considers to acknowledge the results. **BUT EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY:** The results of said referendums were heavily manipulated by the island's corrupt government. In reality, the general feeling of the population in Puerto Rico favors independence from USA just like Hawaii. The older population wants to join USA (60+ age) mainly because they are brain-washed by the propaganda being fed to them like most old people in any country *(though here in PR the older generation's dedication to political parties has been in them for generations, and it's basically sorta like cults and such, not just point of view agreement with their dedicated political parties. They're HARDCORE fans of their political parties)*, and the newer generations want to be independent. However, the island has gone through rough economical and political events that have shifted the population's view towards independence across **ALL** ages (***EVEN THE OLDER GENERATIONS WHO WERE LIFELONG SUPPORTERS*** *have started to change views on every political and economical aspect due to the high level of corruption and terrible conditions in which life is being driven to in this colony.)*\n\nThat 25-40% income which you refer to as \"insulated\" is non existent in the first place. Most of the citizens here are too poor to qualify for said taxes, and on top of that the average family lives well below poverty levels (negative savings environment). The federal minimum wage might be $15, but here in Puerto Rico the minimum wage was $7.25 until January of this year (2022), because it then got bumped to a measly $8.50 ; it's **LITERALLY** impossible to live off the minimum wage here (you are forced to work 2 jobs at least). Also, being a colony is terrible and for some reason some people still don't even know it. I can state a billion reasons why being a colony is so bad, but I will only state three things to keep this simple: *(And I won't even give emphasis on the human rights violations made here by the US government such as experimentations made on Puerto Rican women done in the 50's  to test estrogen and contraceptive pills, where they sterilized approximately 33% of the women population without their knowledge or consent ; or the cancer experimentation done in the population by injecting active cancer cells into the residents of the island)*\n\n1. ***Jones Act*** \\- If for some reason you don't even know what this is, then look it up and then re-think your position about extending benefits to Puertoricans. At the very least, the mere acts of considering or debating whether to extend benefits should be considered an insult to us U.S. citizens.\n2. ***We don't control our economy and decisions can be easily imposed on out government*** \\- Right now we have a *financial board of oversight and management* imposed in our government by the USA which can dictate anything it wants due to the massive debt (caused by both goverments - USA and PR's). Members of said board control important economical aspects of the island which affect every resident in negative aspects. The problem is that said fiscal board is occupied entirely by **(1)** Rich and Powerful mainland economists and lawyers (*who have never stepped outside their priviledged bubbles)* sent by USA who have the same disconnection with the reality and misery of the conditions in which the average family lives and the non-existing and the almost extinct middle class family live in, and by **(2)** members of the main political party of the island called **New Progressive Party (PNP)** \\- Ironically, it is the equivalent of Republicans in USA *(For those who don't know and for some reason think that PR would be another democratic state in the 51st union, know that it would probably and VERY likely be a republican state in the present if we were integrated based on the political views and conservative population that lives here. However, the new generation of residents is mostly liberal and progressive, hence if we were integrated in a couple of decades into the future we'd probably be democratic seats)*. This party is opposed by the **Popular Democratic Party (PPD) -** The equivalent of Democrats in USA. Both parties are extremely corrupt and it is publicly known that they operate together and not in opposition when they do business behind curtains.\n3. **The Goverment does NOT represent us** \\- The government of Puerto Rico is so corrupt that the politicians barely even bother to hide their illegal actions anymore. Every week at least 1 politician appears in the news being arrested or investigated based on corruption charges. In 2019 we kicked out our own governor out of his position for corruption, \\[Basically the trigger to the whole movement was the fact that he stated that he was happy to have gotten away with corruption by tricking \"once again\" the population into believing that he was not corrupt or doing illegal actions. He was very corrupt, as all politicians here, and there is more than enough evidence about him and the whole political party - even the opposing party\\]). Now the government is trying to displace its own residents in order to make space for **RICH** mainland citizens, who are incentivized to come and live here by evading taxes and buying up all the land which is partly illegally sold by the government in the first place.\n\nLast elections there was a lot of problems with the voter's count and it is known that the elections were rigged in favor of the **PNP**, but the government is so corrupt that \"no evidence\" or \"reason to investigate\" was found. Long story short, voter's ballots started popping up everywhere without record of where they came from or who handled them (*and of course, they were in favor of the corrupt PNP)*. They just appeared out of thin air with no evidence whatsoever.**-** ***NOW Going back to the original statement*** **-**\n\nThe average Puertorican doesn't have a 20-40% income to protect because it's already spent on attempting to survive in a negative savings environment. They don't have the money to even reach proper living standards. A huge chunk of the population lives below the poverty level and every year the levels of poverty increase. The population is turning ignorant because the government is making education deliberately less accessible *(actually, it is openly destroying all public education - remember, most of the population lives in poverty levels and now they are being left without ANY schools)*, they are making basic needs such as water and electricity inaccessible. The lights go out **EVERY DAY** on the island, sometimes more than once a day for long periods of time. Hence, we are paying more money for less electricity and for a service that goes out **atleast** *ONCE* a day.\n\nI can keep stating atrocities of this terrible government in the island, but that would just make this comment infinite. It's as bad as it sounds living here, and it gets worse every year.\n\nIf the federal tax is imposed you can be DAMN sure that the fragile economical position in which the average population lives in at the moment will collapse and poverty will skyrocket. USA will then have a colony that will not thrive unless more federal money is poured into it \\*(\\****OH NO!*** *Your federal taxes are now needed to fix the problem created by the same government which created the situation)*\n\n**TLDR:**Yes, we don't pay federal taxes to the government which imposed a colony status on us.Yes, USA should extend benefits to the citizens to whom it created terrible political and economical positions.\n\nIf a federal tax is imposed, it'd have devastating effects on the island's population and more money will be needed to fix it.",

People living in DC have no voting representatives in Congress, those living in DC and voting elsewhere are only able to do so as an out-of-state voter, which is typically limited to military and some college students that keep their parent\u2019s residence as their permanent residence. DC is not a part of Maryland. In theory it could be given back to Maryland, or given to Virginia, or made its own state, or technically given to any state so long as the relevant state and Congress agrees, and even technically sell off. It is Congress\u2019s land and Congress determines what can be done with it and in it (within Constitutional limits, constitutional rights are in full effect in DC, as opposed to the states where they are in effect as the Supreme Court decides).",

The equal protection element is not actually in the Constitution, it was created by the Court as a reflection of the 14A EPC. That clause has been interpreted to mean that every state must treat citizens from other states equally to its own--i.e. New York cannot pass a law that only applies to visiting citizens of New Jersey. The Court extended this to the 5A, which applies to the federal government.\n\nRespondent argued that this requires all federal laws to treat citizens of Puerto Rico the same as citizens of any state. However, this reading of the 5A would make no sense given Article IV's Territory Clause, which gives Congress exclusive authority to regulate the territories of the United States. \n\nSCOTUS made the right decision, there's a reason the opinion was 8-1.",

From what I remember, first, you have to have a population of over a specific amount (I think it\u2019s 5k, could be wrong), then you have to have a vote from the territory (referendum) to show the population wants to become a state, then congress needs to agree to start the process, then a constitutional congress has to be called to write a state constitution, then there\u2019s another vote- simple majority of house and simple majority of the senate, then the president has to approve it and then I think congress has to verify that again. \n\nThe senate and the house need to be changed too.

All territories do. It\u2019s not great, but it is there in the form of non voting members of the house. Control is subjective, as they can in fact secede if they want to. It has to go through congress, yes, but they have the option. They don\u2019t pay federal income tax, though they pay other federal taxes. \n\nThey have their own government and constitutions. They have agency. Territories have their own cultures as well. Puerto Rico may want statehood, but a few of the other big territories prefer being a commonwealth- Guam in particular. \n\nTerritories are not walked on all over. It\u2019s a tightly woven alliance. The US offers the territories things like protection, citizenship, financial aid, and more in exchange for the territories paying taxes and following their laws. \n\nYes, some territories like Puerto Rico want to become states and they should be allowed to become states. But it is not the exploitation that is being talked about. \n\nHow do I know this? I\u2019m *from* a territory. Guam in particular.",

      "text": ">It's a U.S. Territory. That does not make them citizens\n\nThat is correct, sort of.\n\nPuerto Rico is an [unincorporated territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territories_of_the_United_States#Incorporated_vs._unincorporated_territories), in unincorporated territories, residents do not have all the same Constitutional rights as people in states, D.C., and in incorporated territories, including the right if birthright citizenship. \n\nPuerto Ricans [are citizens from birth by statute](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title8-section1402&num=0&edition=prelim), but that is not true for the residents of all territories. [The residents of American Samoa](https://ballotpedia.org/Citizenship_status_in_territories_of_the_United_States) are not U.S. citizens at birth, but can apply for U.S. citizenship.\n\nThe \"imperialist\" Supreme Court AOC is complaining about voted 8-1 against her position, the only justice who dissented was Sotomayor. \n\nWhat AOC left out of her initial statement, was that the \"imperialist\" Supreme Court [ruled in favor of her party's president](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-supreme-court-declines-extend-federal-benefits-puerto-rico-2022-04-21/)\n\n>The justices ruled 8-1 in favor of President Joe Biden's administration, reversing a lower court's ruling that a 1972 decision by Congress to exclude Puerto Rico from the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program violated a U.S. Constitution requirement that laws apply equally to everyone.\n\nSCOTUS's ruling says that Congress can and has always set different tax and benifits program rules for the states and for different territories. Regarding the relevant statute, [the decision also says](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/20-303_6khn.pdf)\n\n>To be eligible for Supplemental Security Income, an individual must be a \u201cresident of the United States,\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a71382c(a)(1)(B)(i), which the statute defines as the 50 States and the District of Columbia, \u00a71382c(e). A later statute included residents of the Northern Mariana Islands in the program. Note following 48 U. S. C. \u00a71801; 90 Stat. 268. But residents of Puerto Rico are not eligible for Supplemental Security Income. Instead, the Federal Government provides supplemental income assistance to covered residents of Puerto Rico through a different benefits program - one that is funded in part by the Federal Government and in part by Puerto Rico. \n\nPuerto Ricans don't get SSI, but they get another, different program instead.\n\nShe knows her tweet about citizenship will get outrage and boost her \"imperialist\" quote well beyond Twitter, and she knows almost nobody is going to look into anything about citizenship or the SCOTUS decision further. She is betting that 99.9 percent of people or more read it her tweet, read the headline, get angry, and move on to the next thing to be angry about.",

This is Biden's policy, if she wants to call anyone \"imperialist\" then Biden is the correct person, but AOC's statement about the Supreme Court fits better with Ds anti-SCOTUS talking points.",

You can be a US citizen without being part of a state, that\u2019s how new states got most of their populations, with citizens settling new territories.

All federal employees (see\u00a0Heritage.org\u00a0Archived\u00a010 February 2010 at the\u00a0Wayback Machine), those who do business with the federal government (see\u00a0MCVPR.com\u00a0Archived\u00a016 January 2010 at\u00a0WebCite), Puerto Rico-based corporations that intend to send funds to the U.S. (see\u00a0p. 9, line 1.\u00a0Archived\u00a03 September 2009 at the\u00a0Wayback Machine), and some others (For example, Puerto Rican residents that are members of the U.S. military, see\u00a0Heritage.org\u00a0Archived\u00a010 February 2010 at the\u00a0Wayback Machine; and Puerto Rico residents who earned income from sources outside Puerto Rico, see\u00a0pp 14\u201315.\u00a0also pay federal\u00a0income\u00a0taxes). In addition, because the cutoff point for income taxation is lower than that of the U.S. IRS code, and because the per-capita income in Puerto Rico is much lower than the average per-capita income on the mainland, more Puerto Rico residents pay income taxes to the local taxation authority than if the IRS code were applied to the island. This occurs because \"the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico government has a wider set of responsibilities than do U.S. State and local governments\" (see\u00a0GAO.gov).\n\nAs residents of Puerto Rico pay into Social Security, Puerto Ricans are eligible for Social Security benefits upon retirement, but are excluded from the\u00a0Supplemental Security Income\u00a0(SSI) (Commonwealth of Puerto Rico residents, unlike residents of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and residents of the 50 States, do not receive the SSI; see\u00a0Socialsecurity.gov), and the island actually receives less than 15% of the\u00a0Medicaid\u00a0funding it would normally receive if it were a U.S. state. Additionally, Medicare providers receive less-than-full state-like reimbursements for services rendered to beneficiaries in Puerto Rico, even though the latter paid fully into the system",

Congress has that power. I believe the point AOC was making is that Puerto Ricans, who are American citizens remember, and pay into social security and medicare, should also have access to other social programs like other American citizens.

Territories and the US agree to certain things like the territory allows the building of military bases and pays federal taxes, while the US gives the people citizenship, federal aid (to a certain extent), and one of the most important things- protection. If\u2026 say Japan invaded Guam for some weird reason again (as they did during WW2), the United States would send its military to go to war with Japan to kick them out. It\u2019s not as one sided as you seem to make it. \n\n2. They absolutely have representation! It\u2019s\u2026 not particularly good representation but each territory has a non-voting representation in the house. They can\u2019t vote but they are allowed to voice their opinions. \n\n3. Territories absolutely can vote to leave. They don\u2019t fall under the secession laws that the states have. The population can vote to start the secession process. Of course, congress has to approve this, but it is not illegal to do and it can actually happen. \n\n4. No presidential candidate would ever bother to campaign in the territories (minus maybe DC). Why? They can\u2019t vote for president. It would be a literal waste of time.",

That doesn't make much sense (To me at least), not even Texas is allowed to leave despite popular belief. I don't hate Puerto Rico nor do I call them Mexicans like some racist idiots, but if a territory is allowed to leave and even has its own form of government with its own laws (I do have to admit though, US is still in charge of foreign affairs) then, is that territory allowed to have the people of it be citezins. Hell the last Peurto Rican election barely had the NPP (New Progresive Party. Pro state) win against the PDP (Popular Democratic Party. Pro territory) with only about a 20,000'ish diffremce between the 2. \n\nIf Puerto Rico becomes a state then that's great, good for the Puerto Ricans. But till then I just don't know if I can agree with people calling them citezins. \n\nAnd just to clear things up, I am not racist I have a friend who's half Puerto Rican and another who's parents moved from Puerto Rico before he was born making him full blooded Puerto Rican just American born. I also hope Puerto Rico becomes the 51st state one day but till then I just can't call them citizens. And if you can't agree with me that's fine, that's what's great about freedom of speech. But in my opinion no matter what you tell me, till Puerto Rico becomes a state, I just can't call them citezins.\n\nEdit: Also your right, she didn't say it wasn't a territory and I apologize for that. Honestly zero idea where I got the idea she said it wasn't a territory.",
