This is how it's used in practise:\n\nperson A: An earthquake happened!\n\nme: no it didn't. There's no structural damage anywhere. No flooding, no uptick in hospital admissions\n\nperson A: absence of evidence is not evidence of absence!\n\n>The problem is that it results in witch hunts when applied to justice. Imagine if I accused you of a murder. I cant find any evidence but I throw you in jail anyway just because I think its suspicious that I can't find anything. You're now assumed guilty until proven innocent.\n\nYeah and that's proving my point. The legal system treats absence of evidence as evidence of absence.\n\nWell, in theory at least. In rape cases, too often no amount of evidence is enough to cause a serious conviction (brock turner) and if you're a black person, no evidence is needed to kill him dead without a trial (too many to name). But the idea of innocent until proven guilty is at least there. I wish it was always properly applied though.",

Cherry picking history is a strange way to make your point. \n\nYes the American health care system is 1000% a joke, don\u2019t get me wrong. Source: work in health care and benefited from the ACA by having insurance for the first time in my adult life. Still do, so, I mean, there was actually been some small progress. Yes, corporate greed lines the pockets of both sides of the aisle, but the republicans actively despise health care and attempt to dismantle the ACA (and every other social service available to the public). It\u2019s hard to make things change when half your county doesn\u2019t even believe in science. \n\nThis is how people with brains *in the US* think too, so it\u2019s not novel. But seeing politics as something a president can control in the manner you suggest is woefully wrong. It\u2019s amazing the ACA ever got through Congress. It wouldn\u2019t now.",

You're basically asking everyone struggling to use all of their free time for a shot at a better life, and I completely get why people settle instead of rocking the boat with the meager amount they already have.\n\nYou are technically correct, the middle and lower middle classes NEED to pressure politicians (who would otherwise do nothing 100% because the current system favors them so highly) to enact fair changes in every facet of government. I just don't blame them for not dedicating their lives to changing it, which is the type of dedication needed by some that is required to change it.\n\nWhat we can do without collective effort is to tell our grandparents to fuck off and raise our children correctly, and my hope is that it will eventually be enough. The likelihood of the working class getting its fair shake in this generation is exceedingly low.",

Even if they could, however, you'd still be begging so-called \"representatives\" to fix problems that are ultimately inherent to the state and capitalism, which they are disincentivized to do because of their roles within these systems.\n\nIf you are curious what I believe people ought do to move toward a better world, I recommend [this essay](https://thenextsystem.org/sites/default/files/2017-07/Symbiosis_AtLargeFirst-corrected-2.pdf).\n\nYou are the first person in this entire thread to actually ask my perspective instead of doing the most idiotic mental gymnastics to invent positions I must oh-so-clearly hold, by the way.",

It's not on you to give that background, but unfortunately human nature means that without other info people are probably going to classify you under whichever they deem worst.\n\nThis exchange didn't change the world lol, but I do hope that those who come across this later understand you better and don't downvote without understanding what you said first. If they still want to downvote, well that's what freedom is I guess.\n\nEdit: fwiw, I'm no saint, I'm guilty too. I'm just trying to be better.",

In the 2017-2018 school year, 75% of school districts reporting to the School Nutrition Association had unpaid student meal debt. The median amount of unpaid meal debt per district has risen by 70% since the 2012-2013 school year, according to SNA.\n\n>Stories of children being lunch shamed grabbed the nation's attention last year. A boy from Ohio had his lunch taken away on his birthday because of an unpaid balance. A school in Rhode Island said it would serve only sun butter and jelly sandwiches to kids with lunch debt.\n\n>The outrage surrounding these stories prompted many states to pass laws that ban the action of denying a hot meal to students with unpaid lunch balances.\n\n>Keoni doesn't know much about the politics of America's lunch debt problem, but one thing he knows is this:\n\n>Helping others is important because \"it just makes the world a better place,\" Keoni said.\n\nhttps://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2020/02/04/us/boy-pays-off-lunch-debt-trnd/index.html",

Hell, the story the tweet is referencing actually does discuss the underlying problem to some extent.\n\nThis is not to say that corporate-owned media outlets aren't pressured to lean on a certain narrative, or that they don't have forbidden territories (I work for one such outlet and you'd better believe there is a lot of oversight on stories pertaining to the corporation that owns us, and its subsidiaries), but not every single story is a deliberate propaganda piece.",

Both in assuming that parents always have some way to provide lunches for their children and only don't cause they're bad parents and even if that's the case, children shouldn't be forced to go hungry just cause of their parents poor behavior. No children should go hungry period.",

No. Feed them at school.\n\n>all children with free lunch but there's never any calls to make employers provide free lunch to their employees.\n\nBecause when it comes down to it, employees can make their own decisions, make their own money, and provide for themselves. Children do not have that capability. Children should not be punished for their parents financial hardship. Schools should be a safe place, regardless of home life. Food and education should go hand in hand.\n\nAdditionally, schools are publicly funded. Their money comes from the taxpayers. Businesses are private. If a business wants to provide free food to employees, they can absolutely do that. But the government can't step in and force it to happen. A school being a federally funded public system means that the school can't just decide to increase their overhead to provide free food to students.",

It should be either entirely free without relying on program applications (which are how a lot of these kids find themselves here; they qualify but parents didn\u2019t fill out a form due early in the year) or free for those who need it and have food people are happy to purchase to subsidize the free meals. They\u2019d prefer that $5 go to their snack bar though for profit, not stay with the actual food served in the lunch line and go towards feeding other hungry students",

We are talking about the main lunch option that is served in most schools in America, not the specialty foods that can be bought for more money. What I am referring to is the bare minimum the school has to offer, which is bought by tax payer dollars, to provide nutritious meals to children in public schools. The cheese sandwich is NOT a regular item on the school cafeteria list, and is solely there to provide to students who are too poor to pay for their lunch. Can parents apply for free lunches? Yes, but some do not qualify, and are still too poor to pay the lunch fee. The issue that I and many others have in this thread is that food is being THROWN AWAY instead of given to less fortunate students. While you may see a cheese sandwich as nutritious (it isn't) the point is that cheese sandwich is replacing a perfectly nutritious lunch that is thrown in the garbage. As you said, there is real poverty and hunger in the world, and do you really feel like the best option schools have is to throw perfectly good meals away because of a small amount of school lunch debt?",

Every day was cheap pj and J sandwichs. I love what my parents did to for my during that time and will always cherish it but after you only eat PB and J for weeks straight for lunch you get sick of it and almost resent lunch. I remember my friends sometime bringing an extra sandwich for me that had real meat and vegetables and it was the best thing in the world. Never had access to school lunches and I wasn't the only kid that was going hungry but everyone kinda pitched in to help, even the teachers would sometimes spend their own money just to feed some of us.",

Meaning that a lot of them are going to be unbearable, selfish, lazy, apathetic, and incompetent twats. And many will enjoy watching you suffer.\n\nHowever, you realize that you could solve this problem and eliminate all future risk of similar incidents by literally giving her five dollars? Say \u201cHere is a five dollar bill. Only spend this one when you actually need to for food or something.\u201d At this point you might be saying \u201cOh no, my kid would just lose it or spend it on ice cream.\u201d Well that\u2019s just your fault for raising them wrong. Be a better parent if that\u2019s the case. \n\nAlthough to be fair I challenge anybody to work around squealing kids all day and *not* become a bit more apathetic. And lazy when you realize there is no reward for success or punishment for mediocrity. And spiteful when the fiftieth child that week behaves, well, childishly. A near majority of people can\u2019t avoid these pitfalls with *their own* kids. Now imagine that there\u2019s fifty of them. And they\u2019re not even yours. Having to clean up the mashed potatoes a kid maliciously smeared underneath of the tables might make you relish a bit to see them suffer inconsequentially. If you\u2019re a callous person.\n\n\nOh and by the way it seems pretty unlikely that your decision to remove your anxious middleschooler from public school and teach her math in mommy\u2019s living room all day will benefit her or help prepare her for life in reality. You remember being a kid right? Did you go to public school? Then surely you\u2019ll remember going through all of the same bullshit.\n\nElementary school was 6 years of being treated in a profoundly unfair and herding manner by adults that are likely less sensible than you are if you have an IQ above room temperature. Punishments for things you didn\u2019t do. Bearing unprovoked chastisement, discomfort, and bureaucracy surrounding basic bodily needs. \n\nMiddle school was, by all accounts and everyone\u2019s accounts, the best of times but mostly the worst of times. By far the most anxiety riddled and confusing time of most people\u2019s lives. The most spiteful teachers. And for good reason\u2014middle schoolers suck. Chicken and the egg there.\n\nHigh school all the feelings from middle school remain, but now you\u2019re better equipped to deal with them. And childhood stress gradually makes way for adult stress.\n\nBy depriving your kid of that natural progression you\u2019ve done her a severe disservice. There\u2019s simply no practice like repetition. And the amount of social interactions repeated every day for 8 hours your kid is missing is impossible to get elsewhere. Exposure therapy may suck. But it will teach you to cope. Is your solution to her anxiety just for her never to confront it?\n\nI would know because I went through the exact same things in school. Middle school nearly broke me. Through sheer strength of will I made it to high school and then I began to learn an identity that is compatible with this terrible anxiety I feel. I learned that people and life are not to be feared, because I can have these feelings and be okay. My heart may be pounding and my hands may be sweating but I am too powerful to be stopped by the jitters. I can confront an everyday situation as the picture of confidence and composure while inside my body is screaming as if I\u2019d jumped out of a plane. If your kid is anything like me she will have those feelings for her entire life. Now she\u2019s used to \u201crun away from the stress and isolate yourself with mommy\u201d being the solution.",

You're never going to get higher quality more nutritious school lunches if you slash their funding and that is a much worse problem.",

There's an income threshold for each. usually its close/at the poverty line for family size. a lot of kids were allowed a single free lunch or a reduced fee which back when i was in school was like $.35 but that was 20 years ago. this is obviously an imperfect solution, but it was done with helping these kids in mind. \n\na lot of schools have tried to implement a free hot breakfast and midday snack programs to offset some of the lunch, and other schools are trying to factor in free lunch for everyone into their budget.

      "text": "Okay so, I just want to throw this out there because I'm almost certain everyone just read the picture and their general dislike for American social programs kicked in, but this actually was pretty misleading in how it was worded. \n\nSo first off this kid payed off $500 dollars worth preexisting debts spread across at least 7 kids who are referenced to have given thanks to him. Another $1000 was to be saved to pay off future debts, and the rest was donated to surrounding schools to pay off other debts. \n\nSecondly these were kids who were roughly middle class with both parents as accordance with Washington state law. Meals were also only $2 per which means these were built up for more than a month on average which is fine. The children also would hold basically no repricusion for not paying these debts, and if the parents were anything like mine a few may have just decided to pay off the debts all at once. \n\nFinally there was no actual impending reason for this kid to do what he did. He was inspired to do it by Richard Sherman who also did something similar. \n\nI'm not saying that there aren't cases where this kind of thing gets out of hand, or that American systems are great when compared to smaller and totally different counties. I get things are rough for a lot of people and more should be done, but the hate this generates is blown way out of proportion. \n\nTl/Dr: this post is going to get disliked to hell :D",

However, if someone who doesn't qualify for free lunch doesn't bring money, the school will often feed them anyway and allow them to pay later on.

I grew up with food insecurity and survived on picking up all the random change I could find, redeeming cans for recycling, and then buying a bean and cheese burrito from Taco Bell. My friends shared their lunches with me, but I never wanted to be a burden so I never let on just how hungry I was. I was the kid always inviting themselves over for dinner at someone else\u2019s house. I developed a pretty severe eating disorder later on and still struggle with panic in food situations. My school didn\u2019t allow lunch debt and my parents refused to pay for school lunch. We had no food in the house that wasn\u2019t moldy (hoarders) and they ate out all the time. Sometimes I was brought along, but didn\u2019t get to order because they didn\u2019t want to spend the money on me. Many times I was just left home alone even from a young age. So much of my childhood was spent trying to figure out where and how to get my next meal. We were not poor, I just had shitty parents. \n\nAs an adult, I am an enthusiastic supporter of feeding any child who is hungry. I don\u2019t care what their home situation is or how much money their parents make. In a nation (US) that spends a shit ton of money on defense, we can afford to make sure that all kids have access to food regardless of their parents.",

And I know this isn\u2019t how you meant this is come across, but anything in my means to even slightly reduce a child\u2019s suffering is worth it. And going hungry is not a minor issue. It\u2019s one of the basic needs. Friends in similar situations did not make it out like I did. Some are dead from addiction or still in the throes of it. Some are repeating the cycle. And a few of us made it out. Just because we can\u2019t fix everything, doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t try to fix what we can. Food insecurity takes up a huge mental space. I wonder how my life would have been different if I knew I where two of my meals would come from on school days.

I, along with many others, have gone through this treatment. If you haven't, you are privileged and should be thankful instead of trying to lessen others experiences. It's part of a lot of people's American experience.",

Because I came to the US with nothing and as most immigrants looked at the America as the land of opportunity. And worked my ass off from the start to succeed here. So my view is a bit biased when I see this constant whining by the BernieBros and others about how terrible this country is. If you don't have enough money for lunch as a kid in today's US you have to ask why your parents did this to you, because for the very poor there is a crapload of various programs - from SNAP to rental assistance, school lunches, etc. One has to try really hard to go hungry in the US. If anything kids eat too much here.",

      "text": "You know, thinking back in my elementary school days, it does seem really fucked up to think I was forced by law to attend a public school, was forced to go to the cafeteria, and when it came time to get your food, you either got the free food from the voucher or like many, you had to pay $2 to the lunch lady at the register. However in my school you had to have a special number you said at the register. This way they knew if you had to pay or get free lunch. I had to pay and use my number. \n\nThe number would change each year. If you forgot the number they took your lunch away. I was like 5-10 years old at that school. Why was there a register in the public school cafeteria for 5-10 year old? Sometimes as a kid, you could easily lose your lunch money. Didn\u2019t have a wallet then, I just had two dollars sitting in my pockets.\n\nI\u2019ve had my lunch taken away plenty of times. I don\u2019t really recall if I got a different lunch, but they definitely made you sit there with the rest of the kids and they also monitored your plates to make sure you ate enough.\n\nAs a side complaint, my cafeteria had a traffic light thing set up in the middle of the cafeteria that went from green to yellow to red and changed based on how much noise was being made in the cafeteria. If it stayed red too long they would make you late or not let you go outside to play. It wasn\u2019t ever THAT loud and was overly sensitive.\n\nAND\u2026.AND (sorry repressed memories) when it got close to time to going back inside for class, the FREEZE bell would ring. You have to stop dead in your tracks and not move in the slightest or else your get a demerit. For like 10 seconds you had to stand still till the next sound let you move again. I always wonder what would happen if at that moment a helicopter happen to be flying over the school in those 10 seconds and would freak them out seeing hundreds of frozen children.",

That means 2 parents making just a smidge over minimum wage, full time, providing for 2 additional children would not qualify for reduced lunches. \n\nThere are charities out there for erasing school lunch debt because this is an actual thing because it's been a problem across the US. For example: https://www.schoollunchfairy.org/\n\nHowever, it's slowly becoming a thing where states are beginning to address this issue. California for example now offers free lunches for all children, not just poverty level, to ensure that all kids get a chance at getting meals. So even if the kids forget their lunch or money, or their parents don't pack them a lunch, they don't have to go hungry or rack up school lunch debt.",

Home school, education/ vocational co-ops. Government funded school choice via voucher system. Higher investment in magnet schools. Higher investment in teachers.

But during Covid...\n\n\"More than half of U.S. families reported decreases in household employment income at some point during 2020 (U.S. Census Bureau 2021), with low-income families with children experiencing the biggest decline (Bauer et al. 2020). Rates of food insecurity soared in March and April 2020 (Schanzenbach and Pitts 2020) and remained high into early 2021, starting to decline substantially only in April 2021\"\n\nBut the other issue was...\n\n\"As a result of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act and Families First Coronavirus Response Act, which provided cash and food assistance, the poverty rate actually fell in the first four months of the pandemic\"\n\nBut then...\n\n\"The CARES Act provided one-time payments to families below a certain income threshold and a temporary supplement to unemployment benefits (Parolin et al. 2020). With more than $1 billion in funding for federal food assistance programs, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act allowed states to make it easier to apply for or receive benefits, temporarily boosted benefits for some families, and removed or reduced certain restrictions. All states eventually implemented modifications to increase flexibility and boost benefits.\"\n\nThere is a lot more to poverty than just getting the assistance. There are more hurtles than most people think. It's very expensive to be poor.\n\n    \n1. Elliott S, Satterfield SJ, Solorzano G, Bowen S, Hardison-Moody A, Williams L.

My poor friends and I never paid for our school lunches. My wealthy friends did.\n\nHell, I remember a girl, Julie, in middle school who's father was the superintendent. She got free lunch and it was wrong, so, I kid you not, people called her Free Lunch, even her friends. It was her nickname.  Sorry, nostalgic tangent there...\n\nAnyways, food costs money. Schools provide food to all kids even if they can't pay but charge the parents if the kids aren't on free/reduced, or if the kids want seconds, extra ice cream, etc. Kids DO NOT go hungry in public schools.",

This kid is of the caliber of individual to which the kid actually cares about the issue and is doing something about it. \n\nWhich one of these people are you?

So I would blow all my lunch money in just two weeks and starve for two. This was the norm.\n\nOne day. During my forced hunger strike. I noticed what they did with the old lunch tickets. Not only that. I saw where they put them at the end of the day. They also threw some away.\n\nI took them out of the trash. I found where they put them at the end of the day also found fresh sheets of lunch tickets.\n\nI probably took in total about $400 or more of tickets.\n\nIf you can imagine the \"come up\" I had during the next few weeks. Making it rain tickets on all of my friends and basically giving everyone a free lunch. It was the most fun I had in my life. Followed by the worst experience. \n\nMy mom found my backpack filled with lunch tickets. She turned me in to the school and made me confess. I was expelled. \n\n13 year old me still thinks about this and chases this feeling. No I don't resent my mom. She did what she thought was best which of course was the worst possible idea ever and led me down a very shitty road. Oh well....",

But in high school we didn't have a restaurant so we got a card with 6$/day on it where we could get decent meals in a range of 50 different restaurants in the city. I gained some weight during that time because at one kebab place you'd get a kebabroll, fries and a medium soda with the card. We could also get pizza and Thai buffet by just adding 1$.\n\nIt was hilarious because that kebab place was always filled with students during lunch hours and it was next to a McDonalds and one time the restaurant chief came out when there was a huge line in the middle of winter and was like \"Damn this place must have some real fucking good kebab!\"\n\nWe had a lot of healthy options as well but most students ate kebab :P",

Up until that point, kids either worked and thus paid for their food, had their parents provide their food or were rich kids with servants and the like. That's a gross oversimplification seeing as circumstances were different from case to case and schooling in general has existed for thousands of years, but I think there is something of note in that governments and people just didn't consider that all these kids suddenly need food provided to them by an organised body. Can't give them free food as that is contrary to the leading ideologies at the time and today, so just require them to pay and handle it between their families and we'll deal with this later? I wonder if mesoamerican schools and other historical school systems provided their students with free food.",

I can understand cutting frivolous benefits to the parents, but if you keep the kids hungry and poor, you're just going to perpetuate the problem. How about give kids the proverbial bootstraps everyone is so fond of lifting themselves by so they *can* get out of the mess their parents made. Crushing children of lousy parents isn't punishing those parents. They already don't care. Keeping those kids from getting a good education and basic food isn't raising our tax base any, nor contributing to anybody's good. A few bucks to help kids out is a good investment.",

If you're America you probably have a lot of crap there that can be used to make a sandwich. You also need bread for that. Assemble the ingredients and place the newly made sandwich in a bag. Bring the bag to school. During lunch break, open the bag and eat the sandwich.\n\nI was too lazy to follow these steps so i did something that for an American would seem crazy: i waited till i got home (probably later than an average US student) and i either ate what my parents prepared or made my own food. Last time i felt the need to have lunch at school was at kindergarten.",

Why should I pay for some lazy jerk who doesn't want to work?

How dare you ask me to pay for what should be their responsibility!\"\n\nI see people commonly say that the \"cruelty is the point\" and I slightly disagree. It's the selfishness that's the point. \n\nPaying billions for military equipment keeps *me* safe. Not paying for social programs keeps *my* taxes lower. It's *me me me me me*. \n\nThat's why kids go hungry and the system lets the rich get off without paying any taxes.

A firefighter has chosen it as his profession and is at an age where manual labor is acceptable. \n\nUnfair/unrelated comparisons (which is also a fallacy) You can't ever know if it was the systems fault when there is a fire, or if it was due to a single persons negligence. \n\nIn our case you literally know it isn't a single person who did it, it's a complex system of political powers that all have a part in it. No single person can be held responsible. The system broken and I could spend all day talking about why.\n\n\n>Also, you say I'm using a strawman argument, but in the same post, you concede that they do give free meals, but then complain about income inequality, which has nothing to do with this. \n\nIf you read my post I also state that the US has unhealthy cheap food in its free meals system. That is partly due to the high income inequality and low funding for the public sector. And income inequality has a large part in it (which again, i stated why if you read it). In places with lower income inequality the selection of food that schools can provide drastically increases since the parent has money to spend on nutritious food.  \n\nSo poor America is being attacked, because even in countries which don't have free meal systems they still get more for the larger amount of money they have. Excluding underdeveloped countries of course since it would be an unfair comparison. \n\nAmerica is a superpower yet it fails in so many sectors. That's why they are in focus, they were once respected as the \"leaders\" of the western world. Partly due to the degradation of the system, but also due to the underlying shit capitalist hellhole it's almost always been. \n\n>The link just stated that -- aside from the current USDA program in America -- Sweden, Finland, Estonia and India are the few countries that provide free school meals to all pupils in compulsory education.\n\nYeah but again the other countries that are comparable with the US, that doesn't have those programs are still better off without it. I think US is one of the only highly developed countries which makes poor people go into debt to get food for their children in school.",
