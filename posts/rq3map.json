Stop giving out passes for lack of basic over sight and accountability.\n\nSecond, the whole thing was completely mismanaged from the start.  It was designed to funnel money to cronnies and raid the coffers yet again.  There was no real stipulations on the money and we handed it out to organizations such as churches!!  \n\nMoney that was meant to keep people employed during a pandemic.\n\nThe PPP program stole money from the American people and tons of lives were ruined over it and ***that was by design.***\n\nJoel Olsteens mega Church was given 4.4 million and it had to be publicly shamed into paying it back and as of September it wasnt paid yet.  \n\nYou know, the church that didnt open to Hurricane Harvey victims, getting and stealing tax money, on purpose and approved.",
