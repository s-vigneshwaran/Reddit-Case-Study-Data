Didnt have to convince her much on.this since she herself decided its better. Even on hijab, I told her I would like if she wore it, I can even force it but I am not gonna force it since its between her and God and if she doesnt do it from the heart its her who is gonna be held accountable for that. So she wore it on her own as well.\n\nYeah western women...I see that close up pretty well haha. Sucks this feminism bs is even catching in muslim countries as well. I agree with you leadership of a country will be in ruin if you put women in it. As you mentioned giving them free rein has absolutely caused division between men and women as a whole and in other aspects. Good men are always better for leaders hence why its forbidden for a woman to lead the country.",

I feel like I\u2019m talking to a Northern conservative from the 1800s who has travelled in time, is trying to blend in, but can\u2019t keep his biases hidden.  \n\nI took a quick look at your comment history, and it\u2019s espoused with extreme examples of misogyny, like \u201cwomen are stupid and crazy\u201d, \u201cwomen are breeding stock for us to use\u201d, \u201cI\u2019ll treat them like objects\u201d, \u201cmen are superior\u201d, and you even talk about women like they are products, questioning others as to where you can \u201cbuy\u201d a traditional woman. Let me remind you that women are human beings, in case you forgot. \n\nYou\u2019ve likely been told this quite a lot, but are you aware that your views are very similar to those of radical incels? You mentioned that you interact with MGTOW ideologue, which is a particularly unhealthy path to venture down.  \n\nIf you\u2019re someone who is chronically online and consistently surround yourself with toxic communities that exist for the sole purpose of upholding this extreme caricature of an entire gender based on preconceived judgements, then it is expected that the natural outcome of this is that you\u2019ll feed into the prejudice presented before you and wind down the rabbit hole of doctrine. In reality, men within these communities have been hurt in the past and need to seek therapy instead of taking their grievances out on innocent people. I can only suggest you to do the same as an alternative to dedicating your time, which you seem to have too much of, to disseminating conspicuous inflammatory comments that are factually inaccurate towards half of the human population. \n\nI know there\u2019ll be no reasoning with you, but I\u2019m going to convey my argument for the readers and just for that smug satisfaction of seeing you fail to grip onto any factual reasoning beyond bigoted stereotypes and pernicious falsehoods. To address whichever point it is that you\u2019re attempting to convey; it\u2019s sad that I have to explain such simple concepts, but no, women are not incapable of rational thinking or reasoning, neither is oppression in any way justifiable. But by all means, you\u2019re more than welcome to move to the Middle East and see how that works out for you! \n\nI\u2019ll try to explain this as best as I can to ensure that it\u2019s comprehendible on your level. There is an abundance of scientific evidence that demonstrates that women are just as capable, if not more capable, than men. This presumption that women are childish, illogical creatures that are incapable of rational discussion is a misogynistic trope that relies on regressive stereotypes that are factually untrue and is a very reductive viewpoint. I\u2019ve noticed you have the tendency to speak with your feelings and inert trauma as opposed to engaging in discourse from a place of factual reasoning. A lot of your perpetuations are a transparent projection of incompetence that you assert onto women by reversing the roles to convince yourself that you\u2019re a \u201crational\u201d being, when in reality, you share the same characteristics of those you claim to despise \u2013 myopic narrative, inability to engage in intellectual debate, and petulant retaliations.  \n\nOn average women, actually score higher on the IQ scale than men by a few points ([source](https://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2012/0717/IQ-test-Women-are-now-scoring-higher-than-men#:~:text=While%20both%20genders'%20IQ%20scores,been%20seen%20around%20the%20world)), and a Scotland study shows that, in terms of variables, men are more likely than women to score on the lower end of the IQ scale, which accurately represents the positions men hold in society in terms of men more likely to be the bottom and top 10% while women are more likely to sit in the middle ([source](https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/chart-of-the-day-scottish-iq-test-scores-by-gender-reveal-the-greater-variability-of-male-intelligence/)). Additionally, we have a copious amount of examples of intelligent and successful women who have accomplished a number of scientific achievements despite facing societal pushbacks and an inequality in opportunity due to their gender, such as Marie Curie, Jane Goodall, Katherine Johnson, Rosalind Franklin, Heidi Lamarr, Rachel Carson, Barbara Mcclintock, Rita Levi-Montalicini,Getrude Elion, Florence Rena Sabin, Ada Lovelace, Janaki Ammal, and Chien Shung-Wu. Is this truly a sign of women being incapable of logical thinking? By all means, I invite you to prove me wrong. \n\nThere are also several studies that estimate higher logical thinking in men than women: \n\n- Women have higher processing speed and semantic processing speed (Camareta 2006 and Trofimova 2013). \n\n- Women are better at prophetic processing and can understand words and language better (Majares 1997). \n\n- Women perform better at writing tasks (Olson, hhslander, Keenan, & willcult 2013). \n\nYou also claim that women are incapable of leadership, which is another factually unfounded contention. Many studies demonstrate that women make better leaders during crisis ([source](https://hbr.org/2020/12/research-women-are-better-leaders-during-a-crisis)), and research shows that women score higher in leadership skills due to their ability to reason with others and work with people ([source](https://hbr.org/2019/06/research-women-score-higher-than-men-in-most-leadership-skills?registration=success)). Additionally, female prime ministers rank the highest in leadership in the United Kingdom (Margaret Thatcher), Australia (Julia Gillard), and New Zealand (Jacinda Ardern), which you can see citation of on Wikipedia. Jacinda Ardern particularly, who is also the younger prime minister in the world, ranked number one in leadership in 2021 due to her prolific response to terrorism, the pandemic, and gender equality ([source](https://womensagenda.com.au/latest/the-five-ways-jacinda-arderns-proved-shes-the-worlds-greatest-leader/). We also have renowned powerful women who changed history, such as Mother Teresa, Asoka, Malala Yousafai, Rosa Parks, Maya Angelou, Sojourner Truth, Edith Cowan, Emeline Pankhurst, Amelia Earheart, Jane Austen, and Florence Knightingale. \n\nIn regards to your insistence to connote emotions with a negative connotation; emotions are what makes us human and lead us to make empathetic and morally righteous decisions in times of conflict \u2013 especially when dictating a society of people. I\u2019m unsure why you feel the need to attach a negative label to a natural psychological human function. I'm even more perplexed on why you believe that women are more \u201cemotional\u201d than men and therefore shouldn\u2019t be placed in positions of power. I think it stems from the notoriety of conflating \u201cemotional\u201d with \u201cemotional intelligence\u201d. \n\nWomen have a higher emotional intelligence than men, which shouldn\u2019t be confused with being inherently more emotional. What this trait means is that women are more likely to express their emotions in a healthy manner and are equipped to deal with their emotions, whereas men are more likely to exert their emotions through negative course of action, such as violent outbursts. There are plenty of academic papers that demonstrate this through their studies, which I\u2019d be more than happy to link you to upon request. Men are extremely emotional, especially in terms of anger, resentment, envy, and depressiveness. This is why we see that most violent crimes are committed by men, and it\u2019s also exemplified through contextualised circumstances, such as a man murdering his cheating spouse, harassing women who reject him, raping others when sexually frustrated, or resorting to a physical altercation when provoked. \n\nIn conclusion, you habitually propagate a concerning amount of erroneous myths that aren\u2019t based on any factual merit, but rather are used as a weapon to baselessly assert that women are lesser than men while simultaneously providing no substance to the discourse beyond unconscionable sophistry. Of course, I don\u2019t expect a reply that isn\u2019t consistent with your inimical rhetoric, so I\u2019ll leave this here for potential readers that aren\u2019t bound by their hypocritical dogmatism.",
