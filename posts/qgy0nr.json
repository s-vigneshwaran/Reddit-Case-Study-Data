Whatever happened to \"bipartisanship\" then?  Seriously though, why the fuck should I vote for people who won't make changes that their side has wanted for years if not decades?",

When I was an elementary schooler it was \"why are they adding all this bid doors and crazy locks?\" \"why do we have to hide in the corner with the lights off, what kind of drill is this?\" and we were just kept in the dark. Of course our parents started to explain it all because when you put blast doors in an elementary school some kid is going to start demanding answers. In middle school it became guards with tasers and phones in every classroom that had a button that connected you right to 911. My aunt was good friends with the parents of one of the kids who died in Sandy Hook and I just remember my aunt breaking down every time she saw a gun real or fake. I played with nerf guns as a kid and when she came over to visit she just started crying and I had no idea why. It's one of those things that is so hard to explain to a kid and growing up hearing each shooting on the news and each new security measure installed in your school just builds this sense of dread. I remember thinking \"when will my school be next?\" \"when will someone pull a gun on us all?\". The fact that it's normalized now because we're all so desensitized to news stories on mass shootings breaks my heart. No one should ever have to fear for their life when going to school.",

For example, it can be specified to \u201cblatant misinformation that can be proven in the court of law using formal Aristotelian logic backed up by peer reviewed evidence [above an arbitrary but sane threshold of approval], wherein this law is only applicable to misinformation relayed through commercial endeavors or entities exempting the world wide web\u201d. Something like that would leave most things alone, including fucking Stormfront, but would get in the way of public broadcasting of lies to the appropriate demographic it affects the most within a reasonable threshold of evidence-needed to enforce. Even if applied after said lie is said on the air, it gives a public avenue to prove without a lick of doubt that a falsehood is false. Eventually it would be preventative. A lawyer could also blow up what I said into many pages of hyper-specification AND in a way that wouldn\u2019t need a 1st amendment amendment, I\u2019m gonna guess.",
