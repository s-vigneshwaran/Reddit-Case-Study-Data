It\u2019s not your job to say or judge that\u2019s god. So people want to have abortion that doesn\u2019t have to do with you and your relationship with god. It\u2019s your job to love and accept them not judge them it\u2019s not your place. And honestly do people forget in the Bible god killed everyone but Noah?

Pro choicers seem to leave the specifics to god.\n\nIn short, the moral difference between killing a grown person and a fetus isn't the most pertinent point. Bringing it up is defers time, money and attention from the real need of the situation. \n\nNo one wants to have an abortion,  but no body wants to care for children and adults. A lot of people see the state of the world, with the way people treat each other, with a total lack of any kind of real and healthy support, and can't have a child. Some are uncared for children themselves.",

Maybe they are desperate, their children need to eat... but at some point it was designated a crime, they were charged and if maybe a jury will be compassionate.\n\nThe only acceptable reason for abortion to not be a crime is if at the time of the abortion the fetus is not a \"baby/person\". I don't know when that happens and I don't purport too. \n\nBut if YOU do believe it's a human and it's \"okay\" to kill because God says don't judge then there's no reason to judge anyone for killing Joe down the street either.",

While the exact definition of life can get a bit messy with regards to things like viruses, there are generally agreed upon markers of when something is alive or not. Things like respiration, sensitivity to environment, reproduction, etc. Living autonomously has never been a factor considered as far as I know. Sooooo many things we consider alive would fall under that. Also, how are you defining autonomous here? Like, a newborn is still completely dependent on the parent after birth.  \n\nRegardless, I'm confident most biologists agree that life does begin at conception. That doesn't mean abortion is wrong though, since the question of when does it become a human/person is entirely different. And that's what really matters. \n\n>there\u2019s a very academically proven and reasoned argument to say pregnancy shares similar patterns to parasitism, and until a life can live on its own, it\u2019s not a life\n\nBut parasites ARE alive though. No zoologist tries to claim it's not alive. That doesn't help your argument at all, calling it a parasite. And I'd be interested in your sources on this. What academic individual describes pregnancy as a parasite? Drawing some similarities between the two is not enough to declare it a parasite, biological classification doesn't work like that. \n\n>Life is not alive until it can live on its own the same way a relationship is not alive until people successfully act on it\n\nThis isn't backed up by anything. This is just your own musings about life. And that's fine, your entitled to your opinion, but a minute ago we were talking about scientific definitions. Nothing about that is scientific.\n\nNot trying to appear confrontational here. Just curious about your position since I didn't understand what you wrote the first time.",

How does a newborn differ from a fetus in that regard? Both require commitment from a parent to keep alive, and both could hypothetically be considered a burden on someone depending on the circumstance. Yet killing a newborn is obviously evil, so following this logic wouldn't a fetus also be? (Not saying that's what I believe, just playing devil's advocate)\n\n>You\u2019re a stickler for definitions, and niche approaches that are logical, but I can\u2019t provide the in-depth verbiage you\u2019re looking for simply because I don\u2019t want to just yet\n\nFair enough, but I would argue that precise definitions matter a great deal in a debate like this. Given the high stakes involved, we need to be clear about what we are arguing and what our justifications are. But I know this is just reddit, so we probably don't have to take this too seriously anyways.\n\n> i don\u2019t want to be either because of rabbit holes like \u201cwhat is autonomy\u201d and \u201cparasites are alive\u201d when the fact is I know what I think, regardless of scientific rigor.\n\nNo offence, but I don't see how that's different view from a conservative. People should be willing to challenge what they believe and be open to new ideas, not knuckle down on pre conceived ideas, regardless of the debate. And I don't think questions like \"what is autonomy\u201d and \u201cparasites are alive\u201d  are rabbit holes, they're pretty basic questions for a topic like this. The issue of abortion is fundamentally a philosophical question, so of course we have to discuss the details of things.",

From an ethics perspective, I don't think that's a very defensible position. Elderly people are burdens. Refugees are burdens. Homeless people are burdens. Newborns are burdens. All these groups deserve rights however, because you're right to life isn't dependent on other people's approval\n\n But if we're talking about pregnancy complications, like still births and threats to the mother's life, then we can all agree that abortion is absolutely warranted. \n\n>i wouldn\u2019t justify killing a newborn because you\u2019ve already followed through with taking the risk and going back on it now takes away life\n\nPro lifers would likely agree with that position, but argue that by consenting to sex, you've \"followed through with taking the risk\" already. (Let me reiterate that is NOT my position, I'm just pointing out what they'd argue)",

Stephen Hawking's mother may have chosen abortion if she had known about his condition. That would have been their decision. Every one of us could have been aborted if that was our mother's choice. The key idea is choice. Sometimes I think we do too many genetic tests as that can let fear take over. A lot of disabilities are presented as insurmountable when they are most certainly not. \n\nI've worked in mental health with people with severe disabilities. Sometimes suicide is a fair option and sometimes it isn't. It's like abortion, a matter of choice for the individual, and the individual needs to be competent to make that choice. People with mental illnesses may or may not be competent to make that decision. It can vary from day to day as I'm sure you know. \n\nI support the work of Dignitas. Do you?",

Sure, women back out, but at no point did anyone take advantage of my birth mother during the adoption process, and my adopted parents aren't rich fuckers looking to take advantage of anyone. My mother could not physically have children, so why are you casting her as a villain for them saving money to adopt a child in need? Is the system flawed, absolutely, but to cast everyone\\* involved with adoption as being taken advantage of or me being sold, or my family as greedy for wanting a child, that's just fucking ignorant.And a woman who adopts away their child and regrets it, well, tough, you made choices. I've done plenty of things I regret, this is life, and we don't get do-overs. I for one am so happy to have been adopted. Sure I wonder what life could have been like, but I also wonder why my life would have been like if I chose a different college or profession. We make decisions and we live with them. If my birth mother is out there devastated at giving me up, I pray that she at least has the emotional intelligence to realize that at least I am alive, with people who ALWAYS wanted me. Your stance is akin to saying the mothers passing their children to soldiers evacuating war zones are bad mothers for wanting even the possibility for a better life than they could provide. My birth mother was 18, in the deep south where her family was ready to disown her, no job, no plans for education, and a habit of horse betting. She may miss me, but she damn well knew at one point that I stood a better chance here. Shame on you for that comment.\n\nEdit for clarification\\* because I'm sure there are some involved for the wrong reason, but not everyone is.",

That would be a great way to get rid of abortion.\n\nBUT it doesn't mean that the people that are against abortion and against homosexual adoption are incoherent. Indeed, they think that a foetus is a baby and, thus, that an abortion is a murder. Why the fuck would you allow a murder even if the people who are murdered would not have a great life after that ? It's not authorized to kill very poor people nor handicapped persons. There is no contradiction in their logic, even if I agree that they could be more pragmatic.",

It was done purely out of compassion and we had no medical issues whatsoever.\n\nSince we adopted our daughter, three of my friends have adopted, but none out of compassion. They only adopted because they had a mixture of problems or genetic diseases or wanted a specific gender. \n\nAside from the lack of compassion, adoption is a very hard process (we live in the UK). It cost us about \u00a325k in 2015/16 and took about 18 months from start to finish. It was a long and gruelling path and I would do it again in a heartbeat. However, the costs alone are a deterrent for people wanting adoption. A friend of mine in Canada couldn't even adopt because he wasn't Christian and almost all local children were Christian and international adoption from the places that he wanted wasn't allowed because of various international laws and regulations. The adoption route is quite hard.",

It's not all good or all bad. No family is.\n\nTo be perfectly honest - you find it narcissistic to adopt. Others would find if narcissistic to have children when there are already so many children in the world and so many in the foster care system. Others would find it ultimate narcissism to go out of your way to find a donor egg, fertilize eggs via IVF and then find a surrogate to carry the embryo for nine months when options like adoption exist.\n\nNo family is perfect.

It's also to make parenthood less economically devestating. Childcare is costing a family member over two thousand a month. She's using the inexpensive daycare, too. It's brutal.\n\nEven with all that available - there will be a number of people who are incapable or don't want parenthood who also don't want an abortion. The children have to go somewhere.\n\nThere's also ethical concerns about overseas adoptions that are an entirely different set of arguments.\n\nSome families work. Some don't. You can't force women who wish to opt out of parenthood to keep a child or to get an abortion. Not all their families are capable of raising children. Where else will those children go?

I am on the other side of it, and this is merely my experience - but I\u2019m a mother who gave my child up for adoption at birth and I agree with you 100%. My daughter is an adult now, and I would never choose adoption if I had to go back and do it again. I never knew the emotional trauma it was going to cause both of us, and it never goes away. Luckily we have a relationship, but it\u2019s not what it would be if I had raised her and she often speaks of how she wishes she could have just went home with me from the hospital instead of being adopted. She actually had it worse with her adopters, and they turned out to be the opposite of what I was lead to believe and wanted for my daughter. They were abusive and the adoptive mother is a narcissist who tried so hard to stop me and my daughter from having a relationship because she was so threatened by our bond. She sabotaged so many things for so many years and told my daughter so many lies about her origins and about me, and even hid her adoption from her until she found out as a pre-teen. Even though the adopter went on to have her own biological child eventually, it\u2019s like she\u2019s obsessed with my daughter and treats her like she\u2019s a possession, it\u2019s weird and creeps me out.\n\nAdoption is its own beast that so many people are still so clueless about, like how most people don\u2019t even know how the modern adoption movement was normalized by a horrible woman named Georgia Tann that would literally steal kids to sell them to rich infertile couples. I\u2019m tired of the glorification of adoption and I\u2019m tired of people not listening to those most negatively affected by adoption. I\u2019ve seen adoptees get shut down so many times and be told to \u201cbe grateful\u201d just for expressing negative feelings about their own adoption experiences. It\u2019s gross. If a woman chooses to continue a pregnancy, I will always advocate for family preservation in cases where a child isn\u2019t in any danger, and guardianship if nobody in the family is able to care for them. I will always support abortion for those who just don\u2019t want to continue a pregnancy, no matter the reasoning. Nobody owes anyone their child just because another person cannot conceive one.",

You'd need a solid definition of life. So instead of messing with things I don't understand, I'll address the things I do understand. \n\nBut this is the whole point of the argument.

You actually can try to make an argument for why you believe what you do. Why _do_ you think an embryo is not a person? Why should anyone else believe it? You have to be able to answer that..\n\n>Plus, everyone who uses the Bible to condemn abortion is a hypocrite.\n\nBelieve it or not a lot of people don't use the bible for this. Anyone can just think that an embryo is a baby. You and I happen not to; did we get that idea from a specific book that someone can hold up and make arguments out of? Or is it just something you assume because politics is a team sport to you and you wanna be a good lefty?",

Otherwise any argument you make in favor of abortion can be attacked by just swapping out \"fetus\" for \"toddler\" and seeing how absurd it sounds. You have to prove that the two aren't interchangeable.\n\nI realize that's very hard, and very subjective, but you have to be able to at least try.

I wasted a bunch of time with another guy who was begging the question the exact same way you are so I'm just gonna spell this out for you to hopefully clarify:\n\nIn an abortion, there are two major interests (potentially) involved:\n\nA) the bodily autonomy of the mother\n\nB) the life of the child\n\nThe pro-choice vs pro-life argument hinges entirely on whether (B) is real. Pro-choice people say \"B isn't real so we should focus on A\" and pro-life people say \"We should focus on both A and B because B is very real and there's actually a lot of situations where you'd pick B over A if you believed B was real\". At the very least, if B is real, there's a big, serious conflict of interest that needs to be mediated by some third party, which would have to be the state. If it's not real, then all the arguments about rights, privacy, etc follow naturally from the fact that it's obviously 100% solely about the mother's interest. Your argument is \"we can't agree on B, so let's just ignore B for now and only focus on the empirical factors that affect A\". Which is literally stepping past the entire argument and effectively saying \"let's all compromise by just being pro-choice\".",

Which is at least a somewhat consistent argument, but still not a good one.\n\nThe problem here is that you can't say \"we would never let a person rely on another person's body in an analogous situation!\" because there is no analogous situation. We can't compare a mother's relationship to a fetus to any other human relationship for which we have an existing and workable moral or legal framework, because you have to at least include all these factors, which this analogy does not:\n\n1) The \"parasite\" is fully reliant on the \"host\" to survive and cannot advocate for itself\n\n2) The parasite had no autonomy whatsoever in creating this relationship, while the host may or may not have\n\n3) The host/parasite relationship is a fundamental and necessary stage for all human development\n\n(3) is important because we use it as justification for restricting the rights of parents all the time. If you have a child in your care, the state can and will force you to feed, clothe, house, and care for them in ways that will cause you physical, financial, and emotional burdens. We allow this infringement on your rights because we recognize that humans all require this kind of support in their early development. So you could make a reasonable argument that the state's ability to enforce a parent providing care extends to the physical support necessary to keep an unborn baby alive, if you're already admitting that it is a human baby.\n\nNow is this argument airtight? Certainly not. But it's at least reasonable _enough_ that you could reasonably say states should decide it for themselves without having the supreme court force their hand.\n\nI'm sorry my dude but you're not gonna get around needing to argue that the fetus/embryo is in fact not a person, or at least doesn't have the right to life.",

The sad fact is many adolescent fosters simply will age out of the system - legal abortions or not.\n\nParents are looking for newborns without baggage, as crude as it may be. A lot of parents give up or don\u2019t start because of the severe competition. A lot of homosexual couples especially have a difficult time getting their foot in the door and appealing to agencies for a chance.\n\nI doubt Republicans will ever properly invest in adoption services for the same reason that only 20% of the US actually wants a total abortion ban \u2026 but nonetheless, adoption isn\u2019t farfetched or unworkable.",

I'm simply criticizing their rationale that killing \"babies\" is wrong while they simultaneously stating that they don't care about what happens to them afterwards. **\"It doesn't actually make you hypocritical to be against what you consider to be the legal murder of children even if you don't give a flying fuck about them once they're born.\"**\n\nAlso, **\"For example, I personally think that forgiving student loan debt is kind of a bad idea because it's a massive wealth transfer to the upper-middle and upper-classes. But if someone proposed a law that made it legal to hunt college grads for sport, I could still be against that, because I think they have the right to not be murdered, even if I don't think they have the right to a taxpayer bailout of their debts. You really only need the \"right to not be murdered\" part.\"** This argument is not even remotely comparable to the abortion debate. Which part of any of this is even remotely logical?\n\nI agree that you don't need to be willing to adopt to support adoption over abortion, but that's not the point that I'm making at all.\n\n>You and many others are angry and I get that. However you do no good by ignoring concerns of others or twisting their arguments with your own logical fallacies.\n\nNo, I'm actually addressing the direct statements of the commentator, unlike you who actually is contorting my arguments to that you can argue against that rather than what I actually said.\n\n>What\u2019s more is that you all downvote people trying to help you understand that you are making bad arguments.\n\nAnd how would you know who I'm downvoting?\n\n>This is coming from 2 people now that agree with your political stance.

You're seriously comparing *that*, abortion, to animal abuse? If this is what **pro-birthers** believe then I can't have a serious conversation with them.

Also, it\u2019s ironic given that your one and only debate tactic is to keep reframing the same flawed analogy over and over again. You framing the conversation improperly by saying shit like comparing abortions to hunting people for sport just shows how broken your train thought is. People aren\u2019t going to debate an argument that is fundamentally flawed. A law that makes it legal for a doctor to kill a fetus is not comparable to a law that makes it OK to kill babies.\n\n1. I never said that you yourself have to be willing to adopt to be anti-abortion. \n\n2. This is a flawed argument because we\u2019re not talking about killing babies, we\u2019re talking about a fetus that most people could probably be tricked into thinking is a reptile with a photo of it. There\u2019s a pretty great leap from killing something in utero that doesn\u2019t even know that it exists and trying to injure a two year old in hopes that you will kill it. In terms of how actual abortions work, it\u2019s a much bigger issue than just killing someone because they\u2019ll have a shifty life. Given the complications and long lasting effects that being forced to give a birth to an unwanted child has on the mother alone, I advocate for them terminating *a fetus*. This is further compounded by the fact that given the state of the adoption system in the US, there\u2019s a pretty great chance people are in for a shitty life. My point is that these people claim to value life yet they don\u2019t care at all about quality of life, they aren\u2019t pro-life, they\u2019re pro-birth. They don\u2019t care about the impact that forcing a woman to come to term has on the parent or child, yet they want he the child to be born because...?\n\nCan you yourself explain why killing a *fetus* (not a two your old, not a college student) is actually wrong?",

When people argue about abortion these days, the one thing that people can agree on is that there is no universal standard that determines when ending a person\u2019s existence is considered killing them. The fact is there is no measure in science that tells us when a person is considered \u201calive\u201d. Some say it\u2019s when a person is conceived, the Bible says that\u2019s when a person first draws breath, but the reality is that there is simply no objective metric by which we can say a \u201cthis has the age where killing someone is bad\u201d. It\u2019s just a matter of philosophical debate for when clump of cells stops just being a clump of cells and becomes a \u201cperson\u201d. All we can do is go off of what we do know, and what we do know is the impact that forced pregnancies have on women and their children is profound. Since there is no way to objectively determine when its \u201cwrong\u201d to kill someone who hasn\u2019t been born, and the effects of which will ultimately impact the mother and child, I think the most ethical choice to to leave it in the hands of the person carrying the child. The debate isn\u2019t really about whether or it\u2019s murder anymore, it\u2019s about whether or not we should punish women for fucking without the intent of procreating. Also, statistically, making abortion illegal doesn\u2019t reduce rates of abortion, dozens of women die every year from back alley operations (if not let permanently deformed). So even if abortions are \u201cevil\u201d, making them legal is still a more morally righteous choice. \n\n\u201cIf you can't make the actual argument for why you think there is one, you already lost.\u201d\n\nSays the person who can\u2019t answer a simple question as to why you think killings fetus is fundamentally the same as killing a baby lol.\n\n\u201cYou can't just act indignant when someone takes your shitty, begging-the-question arguments and swaps out \"fetus\" for \"toddler\" to show you how stupid you sound.\u201d\n\nAgain, sorry that I\u2019m not going to work within an inherently flawed paradigm.",

Please try talking to actual pro lifers at some point.

It\u2019s a bad analogy because you and I both subconsciously perceive that killing a two year old innately immoral, as opposed to the morally undefined area of killing a fetus. A closer analogy is whether or not it\u2019s morally justified to kill a fruit fly.\n\nThe *second* flaw in your analogy is that you ignore the plethora of factors and process that go into carrying an unwanted child to term, like the effects that is has on the mother\u2019s own health, the way it will impact the rest of her own life, and how it will impact the child\u2019s life. A two year old simply continuing living is in fact fundamentally different from a hypothetical child being snuffed out from being born into a world of uncertainty. Where most certainty is that they will probably live an incredibly difficult life full of needless suffering that could have been avoided. Carrying a pregnancy to term and giving away a baby is not at all comparable to choosing not to kill a two year old because it\u2019s inconvenient. It\u2019s a hyper-reductive comparison that avoids virtually every aspect of the actual conversation.\n\nThe *third* is if you actually mapped out the existence of a two year old to existence of a fetus, people would still be killing their two year-olds regardless of whether or not it was legal. The only difference is that there is now a significant likelihood of the mother dying in the process. So the only result is now we have people dying at increased rates of them killing their babies\n\nYour analogy of \u201clet\u2019s just kill the two year-old because raising kids is hard\u201d doesn\u2019t at all line up with the reality and effects of having an abortion. And it certainly doesn\u2019t align with the reality of forcing a woman to put that child up for adoption. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t work under this worldview.

But if you think that's a person, you can't use those negative effects to justify killing them.\n\n>The third is if you actually mapped out the existence of a two year old to experience of a fetus, people would still be killing their two year old regardless of whether or not it was legal\n\n\"People are gonna murder anyway. Why bother making it illegal?\"\n\nI honestly don't get how you don't see this. Literally everything you argue falls apart when I swap out a fetus for a toddler and you're still incapable of making any sort of argument for why that's actually wrong. You're just saying \"well we can't agree on whether that analogy is correct so therefore it's incorrect\".",

I intend to be as respectful as I can regarding your response :)\n\n>Okay I'm just gonna draw this out for you because I guess it's actually harder to understand than I thought: in an abortion, there are two major interests (potentially) involved:  \n>  \n>A) the bodily autonomy of the mother  \n>  \n>B) the life of the child  \n>  \n>The pro-choice vs pro-life argument hinges entirely on whether (B) is real.

Your argument is \"we can't agree on B, so let's only focus on the empirical factors that affect A\". Which is literally stepping past the entire argument. The pro life side isn't \"let's ignore both A and B\", it's \"let's consider both A and B because B is actually incredibly important, and in most cases with conflicts like this where we all agree B is real (e.g. a two year old) we actually tend to side with B\".\n\nFirstly, your assertion that there are only two potential factors of the matter is false, the pro-choice side of the debate also considers: (C) the lifelong impact that not having an abortion will have on the mother as well as child and (D) the health of the mother. The overwhelming argument on the pro-choice side is actually, \u201cwe\u2019ve already decided the matter of B, and we also have the concerns of A, C, and D to decide that we should make abortions legal\u201d. I suppose you\u2019ve personally interacted with more open-minded pro-life advocates than I have, because in my experience, the sole argument beyond religious reasons of the pro-life side is consideration B, whether or not killing the fetus is wrong. I have never once seen a pro-life advocate express any concern for the will of the mother, and in fact I have seen many actively advocate against measures to ensure that the mother and child are taken care of, instead focusing solely on their belief that aborting a fetus is morally wrong. Also, there is no conflict like the abortion debate, no one\u2019s debating on whether or not it\u2019s right or wrong to kill two year-olds because it\u2019s already been universally agreed by both sides of the abortion debate to be wrong.\n\nFrom my perspective, the abortion debate at large is actually:\n\nPro-Choice: \u201cWe\u2019ve already decided that B has been solved, killing a fetus is not morally wrong. So our main issue is C, what the impact of bringing the child into the world will have on the mother and baby, and especially D, what the state of the mother\u2019s health is. Of course, we also care about A, the bodily autonomy of the mother to do as she pleases. Abortions should be legal.\n\nPro-Life: \u201cWe\u2019ve already decided that B has been solved, killing a fetus is just as bad as killing a two-year old. Since we see killing a fetus as being murder, the concerns of A, C, and D do not matter. Abortions should be illegal.\n\nMy argument in the debate between the two of us was, \u201cif we can\u2019t agree on B then let\u2019s focus on A, C, and D\", which I do see as fair since the health of people is still a concern even when you move past B. The problem with the pro-choice argument is that it considers B and only B. To your point that if the two sides can\u2019t agree on whether not abortions are murder we have to have it decided by the state decide, I suppose that aspect is a decent. However, there is my concern of the philosophy of majority rule, seeing as how the majority of public opinion has already voted that abortions should be legal in all or most cases, while the minority has voted the opposite. The issue here is this being a moral debate (not to be confused with ethics), one could argue that the ethical value has already been determined by the majority.\n\n>To answer the other part of your argument, assuming you think a fetus is a person, I don't agree that there's some special practical difficulty that makes murdering a fetus justifiable but not murdering a toddler. By that logic if you had a kid that you could empirically prove would fuck your life up enough and you just didn't have a way to give them up, you could freely murder them.\n\nI don\u2019t have too much to say here but I have thought about this more. Even if you think a fetus is a person, having an abortions isn\u2019t just a selfish thought of \u201coh, this is inconvenient so let me kill my baby\u201d, it also depends on what will happen to the child. Many people get pregnant when they are young and know that they don\u2019t have the resources to take care of their child, but moreover, don\u2019t believe that their child will be taken care of if given away. So even for those people who do see killing their fetus as killing their baby, they believe aborting them so that they don\u2019t have to suffer is morally right. This in principle is the same as killing your two year-old to spare them from a bad life.\n\n>The idea that if we could have fewer murders by legalizing murder it might make sense to legalize murder? No I don't feel like getting into a huge meta-ethical argument for why we have laws and whether they're empirically justifiable. I'm just gonna side with the vast majority of people who would argue that murder should still be illegal because a society that says otherwise is probably bonkers and fundamentally doesn't work.\n\nIt\u2019s not really a metaphysical argument, but it does deal with utilitarian ideology. In a way, you could see this as a variation of how we see the trolley problem. Eve if you operate under the worldview that murder should be illegal because you don\u2019t want people to die, you still must face the utilitarian argument that contradicts your rationale. Let\u2019s say you have to live in a society where you have two options: 1. keep murder legal and have at least 50 people die a year or 2. make murder illegal and have less than 50 people die a year die from murder. Even if you think abortions being legal is the same as making murder legal, you have to face the reality that it prevents even more death, less death ultimately being what you want to achieve. And if you defer to society to decide, the majority of the people in the real world who voted for legal abortion would argue that society is still fundamentally stable with this abortion law, which you\u2019ve equated to murder. Under this paradigm, you've agreed with most people that abortions should be legal.",

If you wanna play this game of listing out all the individual harms to each party we can add an E, F, G... for each thing the baby loses by being killed.\n\nOK, I better understand what I meant. But regardless, my point is that saying \"bodily autonomy\" is reductive because that could mean the woman's personal desire simply to whatever she wants with her body. Her health as well as her concerns for what will happen to her and her child are defined as distinct issues. Everything the potential baby loses is already encompassed under \"life\", the value of which being one of the mother's concerns. A better way to clear up this confusion would be to say, \"the two major interests are the mother's various concerns and the right of fetus to live\".\n\n>Have you listened to the oral arguments for the pro-life side on this supreme court case? The whole thing is that the state should have the right to decide how to balance the two rights, not that only the baby's rights matter.\n\nI was talking your average pro-life advocate's moral arguments, not those examining this from a legal perspective. You yourself just stated that there\u2019s *legal* argument is about the state's right to decide what how to deal with the dispute, this supersedes the moral debate and looks at the situation from a practical perspective. Even if you see the legal responsibility as being a moral argument, this is in itself is more a utilitarian than deontological ideology.\n\n>In the sense of conflicts between the rights of the parent and the needs of a child? There's tons of comparable conflicts. The state can and will force you to feed, clothe, house, etc any child in your care, and take on whatever physical, financial, and emotional burdens that entails, because in those cases it is weighing B more than A.\n\nWhether or not a baby should be taken care is not a debate. Again, you are presupposing that a fetus has the same value as a baby, something that in this debate we've already established has not been universally determined. There aren't any debates like the abortion debate because no one is debating on whether or not a baby should be taken care of or be killed, that has already been decided, unlike the value of a fetus. We keep going in circles here.\n\n>I disagree with this (given the arguments I've seen in the SC case) but I will say, we weight murder pretty heavily in most situations.

But we don't entertain these arguments because our rationale is not rooted in utilitarianism.\n\nMetaphysics and metaethics are two different disciplines. But if you don't want to get into any of the more abstract arguments I understand. However, I will say that the ideal reason why democratic laws exist is because they're supposed to minimize the damage to the collective from individual action. Laws by nature are more utilitarian than deontological. Dictatorships aren't as concerned about the collective as they are with the individuals in power, the utilitarian perspective is \"my personal desire over the collective's desire, I will achieve my personal desires by any means possible\". Which is antithetical to the democratic utilitarian desire to achieve positive outcomes for the collective of society (e.g. reduce as much murder as possible).\n\nMy point is, your dictatorship argument doesn\u2019t work because the point of a dictatorship isn\u2019t to make society better, it\u2019s to serve the desire of the individuals in power. Utilitarianism is reductively, \u201cthe ends justify the means\u201d. What the end you aspire to have depends on the context.",

Either way, I\u2019ve already stated that the SC is by nature not concerned with what the majority of people wants but rather makes rulings based off of their interpretation of the constitution. When I first brought up majority rule in this conversation was just stating my personal issues with the process.\n\n>Roe doesn't really create a \"right to bodily autonomy\". It just infers the right to abortions from the right to privacy, which is an incredibly shakey ground. Then it says \"because we infer this right, states are not allowed to actually determine this themselves\". Which means that this \"right\", at the federal level, had absolutely zero actual support or input from the American voting base. It's just a ruling that happened to go the way you like. Overturning it would, by definition, be returning the choices involved to majority rule.\n\nNow that\u2019s actually fair point, thank you for the clarification.\n\n>This is a function of democracy working in those states. The people in those states, by and large, do not have the same beliefs you do. They are not going to govern themselves the way you would like to be governed.\n\nYes I\u2019m aware of those democratic elements at play, I\u2019m just stating people\u2019s frustrations with now effectively being unable to get abortions even out of state without a legal fight. This being something that was previously illegal for all of the complications that were involved in the process.\n\n>This is all slippery slope fear mongering but if you have grounding for any of it in the actual text of the decision I'm curious to see it.\n\nI think it's more than just fear mongering when a set of justices use their expertise as licensed law practitioners to do all but explicitly state that they aren\u2019t going to do something, just so that they can make a decision without anyone having legal recourse (even the case could be made that they should be impeached for intentionally manipulating the record via technicality). I think this reason bout of manipulation has lead the current justice\u2019s legitimacy to have gone out of the window, or at least should very well indicate some severe conflict of interest. Moreover, people are scared because laws broadly banning abortion (as it wasn\u2019t originally described as a constitutional right) could very well extend to forms of contraception, which have historically been referred to by opponents of abortions rights as \u201cabortion causing medications\u201d. On that front, I think it\u2019s an entirely justified fear to contraceptives are next. And about gay marriage ruling (which follows the same logic \u201cright to privacy\u201d), given all that has happened recently happened regarding the demonization of the LGBT community I can see why so people would have these concerns. Whether or not I personally think they are justified with this concern, I still have mixed feelings about. If you look at the greater context of this, I think there is every reason to think that Roe v Wade being overturned could lead to similar cases taking place.\n\nIf that's done, I'm not sure we have much else to talk about, or be talked down to about.",

The adoption rate in the US is terribly low, especially if the child is non-white or has any health or developmental issues. We're incredibly low among first world countries in the rates in which mothers and \"babies\" die, due to the fact that we do not subsidize pre-natal care and we do very little for newborns. Many working mothers fall into the gap of being completely impoverished, but making too much for some government programs. We also don't guarantee paid maternity or paternity leave (in fact, Conservatives routinely mock the idea of Paternity leave). \n\nI tend to find most pro-lifers to be a form of Christian Identitarianism - often among white women too old to conceive. Once they get the moral identity they crave, they have no further interest.",

It wont help if you are a drug addict that will harm her own child during the pregnancy with their own substance abuse. \n\nOf course those arguments wont make for a \"gotcha you look stupid now\" video, but the really stupid part is that people think those women in the video \"got owned\"",

So if they had another out of wedlock , no more charity for you.   That was Victorian charities.  But with the welfare state, it\u2019s the opposite.  It\u2019s the more you do it or mess up or are not capable of responsibly supporting your own, the more money we give you.  \nSo responsibility is not rewarded freely, it is taxed, whereas irresponsibility is funded and rewarded.  \nthese people have children yes, but they take responsibility for them.  \nThey don\u2019t have to adopt others children to advocate for it.  Even if it seems hypocritical\u2026 and maybe it is. \nBut some troll with a mic and a clever gotcha angle going out to frame their apparent hypocrisy is not any less hypocritical or any more virtuous.

That worker also helps them with legal trouble and other adult stuff. They also ensure that the teenagers go to school and do other things that help them mentally, physically and professionally.\n\nThe system has its drawbacks, but is a bit better than putting the burden on a family in exchange for money.\n\nIn the whole world there is a huge need to invest in caring for and educating children to go full steam ahead in life as well-rounded adults capable of being functional members of society.",

Mandate blood donations every 60 days. \n\nOrgan donor? Yes, yes you are. Fuck checking a box when you get your license. Everyone is a doner. Saving lives is more important than whatever dumb reason you want to have your eyes and heart rot with the rest of you. \n\nVaccinations? I don't care what dumb celebrity told you it'll give your kids autism. They're getting vaccinated, your dirty little disease ridden kids will be safer and so will everyone around them.\n\nDeath sentence? Nope. Life matters over all else, no matter how inconvenient it feels to have to pay to imprison them for life.\n\nPoverty is a killer. It's time for UBI. It's expensive, but life is more important right? End poverty, and end billionaires. \n\nOk, easy wins are over. Let's go on to the more challenging ones. \n\nWe're destroying this planet. Climate change is going to kill millions. Time to start making the major sacrifices we need. Toss the economy out of the window, we're building nuclear, everywhere. Every roof has a solar panel. Every field has a windmill. Every care is electric. Single use plastic is banned. \n\nGreat, we just saved countless lives. \n\nNow, when all of that's done, let's start discussing whether we should force women to grow another shitty human in them to help destroy this planet more quickly.",
