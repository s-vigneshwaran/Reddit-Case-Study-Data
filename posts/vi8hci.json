So in addition to having their land seized, their reservations weren\u2019t even close to their actual land anyway. Additionally, by the time that happened, they were already living fairly assimilated lifestyles, where they had built European-style towns, voted in blocks for their own governments, had post offices and schools and grocery stores. But their land in the Carolinas was to valuable for the government to let them keep it, so they were moved to Oklahoma. Then, that was taken too. So more of them spread around looking for something better than what they were forced to leave. And they also had skills that helped them assimilate into European settlements. There were also bands of them who lived for decades \u201coff grid\u201d nearer to their ancestral lands and often adopted \u201ccontraband\u201d escaped slaves into their tribes, so many Black Americans have also heard about a \u201cCherokee\u201d ancestor. \n\nAs for the 1/16th thing, that\u2019s a full blooded great-great grandparent, which would mean a half-blooded great grandparent, which is close enough to living at the same time that it happens, and to have an overlap of immediate family members.",

Given that it's geographically close to Arabic and had influenced each other, I could probably be fooled if someone put their mind to it. *shrug*\n\nSo... I did choose my words with care.

So assuming that a Mexican speaks Spanish purely based on looks is not only stereotyping, but also insulting because it can make someone feel like they don\u2019t belong to their own culture because of something that\u2019s not their fault. \n\nPlus, there\u2019s many Mexican\u2019s who don\u2019t speak Spanish so it\u2019s not a minority thing. \n\nSorry for the ramble haha let me know if I didn\u2019t make sense",

The number of strictly orthodox and conservative Muslims in the UK is also very small, and these are predominantly in Muslim areas in England. \n\nAnd then, even if all of these unlikely situations were overcome, there happened to be a racist on the bus who 1) didn\u2019t recognise Welsh in Wales and 2) felt compelled to abuse someone and 3) had the misfortune to do so in front of a person who was there to witnesses it, doesn\u2019t know that Wales is the UK, *and* bothered to write into their local chip wrapper about it. \n\nVery, very odd. I\u2019ve seen this \u201cstory\u201d before about Native American languages in the US for an interesting social commentary. But this scenario is beggar\u2019s belief",

I can speak it, having learnt it for 25 years, but I struggle to write in it as the grammar is fiddly and I get self conscious about how non-colloquial my writing is. I still speak it at home on occasion and I speak it often at work. I wouldn\u2019t be included in your 15% figure, but I'd still speak it on a bus with someone else of a similar proficiency to me. Your assumptions are nonsense; your decision that niqabi = Arabic woman is so stupid that I don't even know where to begin with it (hint: many converts and non-Arab Muslims wear them.)\n\nI would probably just stop trying to explain how many people can speak Welsh to Welsh people, because it's actually quite embarrassing to see your logic and to watch you stand by it even as it crumbles in the face of literally anyone who knows more about the topic than you.",
