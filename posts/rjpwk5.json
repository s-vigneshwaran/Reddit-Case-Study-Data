EVEN THEN SHE FOUGHT BACK BEFORE HE GOT THERE.\n\nEdit: Oh yeah and Nezuko is quite literally on the same level as every other main protag if not stronger than the three. She actively saves their asses on multiple occasions. Mentally maybe but even then she acts completely on her own half the time. She bursts out snd fights back weather her brother thinks its safe or not. Where did you get these weird ideas about these characters?",

What you clearly not understand is that a character is not good or well written simply by having physical strength. Asuna is so dependent on kirito it isnt even funny anymore even my femal friends notice it that she is totally mentally dependent on him\n\nJesus your standards are low.\n\nWhen i talk about a great character I mean one that isnt just a sidekick/booster for the mc and actually stand on their own grounds with their own unique believes and free to act independent. For example there isnt a single female character in naruto that fits that description and i find it sad.",

Your idea of dependance is warped. \n\nTell me how in season 1 of sao Asuna was dependant. \nYour example is as garbage as your thought process on what \"great characters mean\" The first half is fine and next to all of my examples fall into place. Chise IS the mc and ends up teaching Elias and he ends up growing qlong side her very often, Mikasa does not boost Eren if anything she dwarfs him in just abiut every field, RIZA HAWKEYE IS LITERALLY THE MAIN THING MAKING MUSTANG FUNCTION. But having an independant arc doesnt make for a god character having counter ideals yes but independance doesnt mean a good character hell often times it means a shittily flawed character. \n\nVegeta is the lancer to Goku he is a fundementally better character than Goku. Bulma is constantly on Gokus side about things but she brings a use to the overall team that not a single other person can manage. Dependance doesnt mean \"Agrees with MC and figts next to them.\" Having a sidekick or backup doesnt make someone a lesser character in fact quite often are they better characters. \n\nAlso using Naruto as an example is hitting the lowest hanging fruit. I fuckin love that series but yeah no shit the girls are written bad. Hinata for all her cuteness and determination is more a waifu plot device to bring give Naruto a better girl to fuck at the end than Sakura. The fact that you act like S1 Asuna doesnt have any independance and isncompletely dependant despite the fact that she has been proactive enough to save Kiritos ass multiple times in s1 is ridiculous. I wanna bring up to Asuna is the lowest of the characters mentioned she is the worst of them and she still blows your atgument away.",

I guess I\u2019m suspicious about the idea of loving my nation because of the way that I think such feelings are used for manipulation. I love living in my country. I have lived in others too, so I can compare. Your experience is also always different in a country that you were born or grew up versus a country that you were an expat in. Especially being that I never intended to become permanent in any other country. \n\nTo some of the things that you listed:\nCultures, traditions, etc., are these things that are strictly related to your nation? Do others share them too? Or, are any of them more localized than your nation? This of course would vary from person to person. There are traditions that I love that aren\u2019t shared by my whole nation. \n\nI guess I love the ideals that my nation supposes to represent. However, the realities of those ideals range wildly from the actions of my nation down to individuals\u2019 experiences within it. \n\nThe way of life to go along with that. Is that way of life a result of your nation? Is it only available to you strictly because of that nation? Again, I think this is going to vary across different nations. \n\nI am not against the idea of living your nation, and I have pride and love for mine, but I am again just suspicious of that feeling.",

Its just something people refer to. As there are differences between people, food, scenery, and history of different countries.  \n\nYou are correct, the average population anywhere is made up of wonderful people imo.  But it doesn't change that you can refer to a single country and point out that you love the people there without having the worst atrocities of that country thrown into your face (that's the part I was referring to as an attack btw)\n\nI never rationalized that everyone loves thier country.  Just that it's not unreasonable.for someone to love thier country.  I'm taking the fact that you speak in such extremes, that nuance isn't your cup of tea.  That's ok too.  My only personal advice to you is take it down a notch, it's a civil conversation.  No need to get angry at strangers.\n\nEdit: I apologize if I made you feel attacked.  It was not my intention.  I was sincerely trying to see why you seemed (im my opinion) upset that this person loves their countyz even with the caveat that they weren't a nationalist.",

Not to mention setting the modern standard on dehumanization, abuse and murder. We know what Stalin did.

You probably have your own definition again yadah yadah but you probably do not know what the ideology of fascism is and I bet you confuse it for simple authoritarianism (which I'm not a fan of either btw). But it is not. You probably don't know what communism or socialism are and still throw those words around and all that shit. I have seen many like this. Some words, especially those describing Ideologies and philosophical tendencies have very exact definitions that will likely not change in the foreseeable future.

                      "text": "No, but... Historically people \\*\\*WERE\\*\\* murdered in public for speaking against the regime and the murderers were usually given a slap on the wrist after arguing that their love of the Emperor and their patriotism overcame them with emotion and they had no choice but to murder the evil, lying, vile, anti-Patriotic, Emperor-hating, degenerate they killed. The courts would usually agree that the victim was a vile person who totally deserved killing and give the murderer a light sentence or simply found not guilty.\n\nThat's a large part of why Admiral Yamamoto was out to sea, on a ship, instead of back at HQ where Admirals belong. He spoke against war with America and the Navy (rightly) feared that he'd be killed by some \"patriot\" if he stayed around on land instead of at sea surrounded by sailors who respected him and knew he was right.\n\nTake a look at the assassination of Inejiro Asanuma, the leader of the Japanese Socialist Party as recently as 1960. It didn't end the way earlier assassinations of people to the left of Tojo did, with the assassin being freed with a hearty handshake and a commendation for a job well done, he killed himself in prison after telling everyone it was his patriotic duty and he'd acted alone. But the assassin is still praised by the Japanese right wing and held up as an example every good Japanese should live up to.\n\nSo.... Yeah. Japan's right wing is scary as fuck, and the part where Yasukuni Shrine is the \\*\\*ONLY\\*\\* war memorial in the entire country is really fucked up. It's run by people who make the people who worship General Lee look sane, and the official position of the priesthood there is that every single person enshrined is now perfected and become a god defending Japan in the afterlife. Explicitly including the  1,068 people who were found guilty of war crimes then enshrined at Yasukuni.\n\nOh, and there's also the part where Yasukuni has enshrined about  27,800 Taiwanese aboriginal people who were enslaved by the Imperial Army and forced to fight (and die) for Japan. Some of their decedents asked that Yasukuni take their ancestors names off the rolls and give their souls back. The priesthood at Yasukuni said that was both impossible and highly offensive as those 27,800 had been purified and were now spiritually Japanese and gods defending Japan spiritually.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMostly the Japanese right wing tends to aggressively ignore foreigners. If you're a foreigner and in Japan on Jan 1, it's mildly fun, in a sort of nervous way, to go to the Emperor's New Year's address and watch the right wingers pretend you don't exist while doing their best to make sure you notice they are pretending you don't exist. I've got a little paper Japanese flag that they gave everyone who went and it was pretty cool. \n\nBut at Yasukuni they get a lot more aggressive. The German fellow there was risking physical assault.",

People just like to feel good saying this or that should be taught but forget they need a lesson plan. what replaces it... Basic forethought in general\n\nIts easy to be mad.\n\nIts hard to have an idea.\n\n\"We learned about the atomic bombs\" is a popular one here.\n\nthey learned about nuclear war and why its wrong. they learned about its signifigance as a factor of development and wartime usage. All of these are important to our progress moving forward and the danger of technology etc. \n\n**Teaching about abhorrent military units and torture has no value outside \"psychopathy bad\" and the fact people cant understand that is shocking. One is culturally, scientifically and realistically a poingmant part of life and technology and the dangers of such things. The other is a disgusting, sensless and incredibly violent act of war.**\n\nA lesson on the bombs of hiroshima absolutely makes sense for educational purpose over needless psychopathy.\n\nI shouldnt simplify it like this and should spend more time defining what I mean but needless to say you are right. Its not as easy as \"just teach this\" and many historical events are just as important as others amd many things are not taught to us and there will come times where you need to educate yourself too. \n\n**School isnt  a catch all for everything you should know. Its a base line for things you NEED to know and that a very important distinction people dont want to acknowledge either**\n\nJapan isnt doing anything overly wrong and I am not going to debate political complexities and governement speeches or their wordings with outrage mobs seeking justice boners on social media.",

Sorry, I thought you were making a jab at me. \n\nI think it's pretty common for high schools in America to briefly teach about Oliver North, Iran-Contra, and generally about central American coups. In college you can go a lot more in depth, but it's not required for every college major.\n\nGenerally speaking though, most government backed coups or regime changes aren't viewed as war crimes. It breaks international law and could be an act of war but it's not the same as a war crime.\n\nThere are other war crimes that aren't taught in high school. Chiefly among them, the killing of civilians during the Caco wars. That's some pretty deep college level history.\n\nSometimes they teach about the My Lai massacre during the Vietnam war and Haditha killings in high school and college, but I think that's a high level learning that most Americans aren't exposed to. It is important to note that not only does the US take responsibility for those specific incidents, but in both cases the responsible parties were court-martialed. \n\nI think it's important to distinguish between war crimes that happened in the past that people, nations, or governments try to erase as if they didn't exist and ones that a country acknowledges and actively seeks to prevent in the future and punish those responsible.\n\nI'm sure there are American politicians who pretend that the US has never committed a war crime, but I hope that they are sufficiently denounced, just like the Japanese politicians in this video who pretended that the Japanese have never committed a war crime. In that case, it's not just Nanking Massacre, it's also Korean comfort women, the massacre of Hui muslims, and massacres in southeast asia. \n\nI don't think we should treat Japanese people if they are personally responsible for these historic war crimes, but we should distinguish between politicians and education that attempts to erase these acts and ones that actively discuss them so that we can understand our past and make steps to prevent them in the future.",

They happened in every continent in almost every war. Even without organized war, civilizations still did the same things. \n\nThe people who try to minimize the US's war crimes by emphasizing the war crimes of others like Japan are not helpful.\n\nPeople who try to minimize the war crimes of Japan or any other country by emphasizing the ones of the US are also not helpful.\n\nThe people who pretend that war crimes somehow started with European colonialism and are the byproduct of it are also not helpful.\n\nThe truth is, every civilization at some point has benefited or profited off of actions so inhumane and injurious that they are the worst of humanity. No one's ancestors are immune or pure in this regard. Sadly this is a common shared historical trait.\n\nWhat isn't shared, however, is what we choose to do in the future. Some of us continue to minimize and erase history to create a false narrative that makes them feel more comfortable. Others, acknowledge historical atrocities in war or otherwise, and make active steps to prevent them in the future.",

Sure the My Lai massacre was a textbook example of a war crime, but it's discussed as this bad incident in an otherwise legitimate war. Which if course it never was, the US had no business being there in the first place, actually suppressed democratic elections there because they knew Ho Chi Minh would've won and of course there's also the issue with the \"body count\". One could argue that since basically every person was considered an enemy combatant and, the only measure of success was by counting the corpses. Which led to a war of extermination, which can be considered a form of genocide. Not for the purpose of extermination tbf, but I don't think that matters all that much if the results are the same.",

There was an entire page and a half talking about slave owners having a bad time after their \"property\" was freed and they fled to Texas.

The US and Japan had been going through almost three decades of military tension in the Pacific. One of the main reasons why the United States put our Pacific military base in Hawaii (and one of the main reasons the US annexed Hawaii) was specifically to counter Japanese agitation.\n\nJapan wanted to take the former American colony and - at the time - protectorate of the United States: the Philippines as a strategic placement. Japanese intelligence determined that it would provoke an American military response, so they decided to attack Pearl Harbor to distract from the Philippines invasion that was launched literally the same day and were betting that the US's Pacific fleet would be too damaged to respond before the Japanese could establish enough resistance in the Pacific. This was a pretty big miscalculation on the part of the Japanese military and really only happened because one of their top admirals threatened to resign if they abandoned plans for the invasion of the Philippines. The oil embargoes just kind of gave the Japanese leadership the excuse they needed to advance a plan that was already in extremely serious stages of discussion while preserving faith in their military command.\n\nSomething that's also important to remember is that most Japanese leadership never thought it could beat the United States in a war. The attack on Pearl Harbor was a strategic attempt to delay American interventionism so they could take positions like the Philippines and surrender on favorable terms that included keeping this new Pacific Empire. They just seriously underestimated how much of a rallying cry to war that Pearl Harbor would be to Americans and how forcefully American industry would move to support military retaliation. When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, no one in the Japanese military or political command was seriously thinking that it was going to be a conflict that ended up reaching the Japanese mainland, let alone the scale of destruction that would follow from the fire bombings and the nukes.",

And if they are pronounced similarly, why is the letter selection so garbage?\n\nWe have to consider that while Mandarin and Cantonese are both sinitic languages, they're both dialects that evolved from a much older common language spoken many centuries ago. Hence the differences in pronunciation and eventually the romanization of words when the West made itself an influence in the region. \n\nAs far as lettering goes, like I say below, it's just the closet approximation when linguistic scholars translate it and most importantly, for **collective ease of use**. For example, the Cantonese word of \"Peking\". \n\nIn the actual language, the pronunciation of first syllable is close to how you would say \"Buck\" BUT before making the K \"Kuh\" sound. However, it's not a hard B \"buh\" sound either as you also incorporate a slight P \"puh\" almost 'pop' sound to it too essentially combining the two sounds with slightly more bias towards the B sound. And then with the \"King\" part, it's more of the same concept. The actual pronunciation is a blend of the hard G \"guh\" and K \"kuh\" with slight bias towards the G which goes into the \"ing\" part with a mild rising intonation. \n\nAnd then finally, when you consider the sheer number of dialects in China there are, you're gonna get a lot of slightly different deviations of the way words are generally pronounced even when they speak the \"standard\" dialect especially back then when education was still quite a luxury for much of the country. Hence why linguistic scholars most likely settled for simply \"Peking\".\n\n\n>Is it because it is like (or is) Pinyin, so it is not developed by westerners so it doesn't \"translate\" well?\n\nIt is very much like pinyin but it's not that it necessarily doesn't \"translate\" well. It's the closet approximation of the pronunciation of the word written in the English or rather, \"Latin\" alphabet. The proper pinyin/romanization would also include the proper tonal marks above the letters since Chinese in general, meaning all of the Chinese dialects are tonal.",

We are now at \"Peiking\" being almost as valid as \"Peijing\", and both being far more accurate than \"Beijing\". Now let's mention the fact that in many varieties, that \"ei\" is read as /e:/ (a long \"e\") and now Peiking transforms into Peking (or Peeking I guess).\n\nThe reason we write \"Beijing\" is simply because in Chinese we use B for /p/ and P for /p^h /, as there's no /b/. The alternative would be to not use B at all while using P and PH, which doesn't solve anything because PH is associated commonly with the sound /f/.",

(Note that I was educated in the states from high school on, so I do have some sense of what you learn about us history in school.) I think Americans are by and large aware that atrocities were committed in Vietnam. I just don\u2019t think that most of them are aware of the scale and shape of those atrocities. Most Americans probably don\u2019t know that the US was bombing the shit out of 2 other neighbouring countries (Laos and Cambodia), or that Mai Lai was the one mediatized and politicized drop in a bucket full of massacres, etc etc.\n\nAnd Vietnam is just one of an endless series of wars the US has been involved in since WW2. The Korean War left 5 million people dead (mostly civilians, mostly firebombed). The most recent Iraq war left half a million people dead (check this out for just one absolutely horrendous anecdote - https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmudiyah_rape_and_killings). I\u2019m not gonna list them all, but the point is these numbers rack up. And then there\u2019s the atrocities perpetrated by client states of the US all over the world, often with US military and diplomatic support. For decades (and to some extent even now) all of Latin America was brutalized by absolutely murderous US puppet regimes. Read something like Manufacturing Consent or The Real Terror network for good qualitative and quantitative data on this. The US actively supported a genocide against \u201ccommunists\u201d (which  basically just meant people the govt didn\u2019t like and all ethnically Chinese people) in Indonesia that claimed I think about 5 million lives. They armed and diplomatically shielded the Indonesian army as it marched on East Timor and tortured and killed pretty much everyone there. Nowadays we\u2019re arming and supporting Saudi, who literally chop up American citizens they don\u2019t like, and who for years now have been responsible for countless atrocities in Yemen. We\u2019re arming and supporting Israel, an apartheid state that routinely randomly bombs residential areas of the occupied territories on the basis that maybe someone from Hamas (by far the most popular political party in Palestine, shame the US and Israel absolutely refuse to acknowledge them as a political force or include them in the political process, one wonders why they\u2019re forced to rely on symbolic acts of violence or protest [by the way it\u2019s completely 100% legal and not terrorism, international law wise, for them to attack israel, since israel\u2019s is an occupying army] to get themselves heard by the international community) was in the area \u2026\n\nYes in the US certain foreign policy \u201cmistakes\u201d are identified and bemoaned, but so much of the fucked up stuff is mostly overlooked, and the \u201cmistakes\u201d are usually justified as those of a benevolent giant who was trying to do good but blundered. It\u2019s not like it benefited US multinational companies for death squads all over Latin America to dismantle organized labor movements through, well, death, lots and lots of it. And of course the US went into Iraq bc Sadam bad and had nukes it really looked like, not because they wanted control of those oil fields. What I\u2019m trying to point to is a prevailing mythology about the US\u2019s intentions as it does what it does. According to this mythology, whatever the US does, it does so in order to promote freedom and democracy and human rights, though it sometimes messes up. That just can\u2019t be true. Not when you look at what the US is actually doing. But, you know, \u201csupport our troops.\u201d\n\nThe biggest difference between the states and Japan has to do with impact, I\u2019d say. Japan is a tiny country that was completely defanged after WWII. The US is an empire with i don\u2019t know how many 100 military bases all over the world, nukes pointed at everyone. It\u2019s by far the world\u2019s greatest superpower, and it\u2019s  the leading state of the \u201cfree world.\u201d It wields an unfathomable amount of power and influence. That\u2019s why it s very important to look at it and its actions and propaganda mechanisms carefully, and to try to move away from a context wherein it de facto dictates the terms under which it can be criticized.",

America putting the lives of its young men over that of the Japanese people is hardly evil. Americas first responsibility is to its people. The lives of young men tend to hold less value in war though as they are the ones expected to die for others. \n\nIt sounds like you would have liked the U.S to be isolationist throughout the 20th century something that really was not possible and very naive given the circumstances of geo politics at the time. I\u2019m retrospect the Cold War might seem unnecessary in our time because communism didn\u2019t end up spreading and gaining as much influence but the threat of the Soviet Union was very real at the time injustice oppressive and cruel as the Nazi regime was.\n\nThe US is hyper sensitive about race, culture, and it\u2019s less than pure past to say most Americans are unaware in a way that Japanese citizens are unaware in regardsto Japanese imperial armies atrocities in Manchuria people were destroying statues over the summer of people with Association slavery native Americans nothing like that will happen in Japanese it\u2019s a silly comparison anytime a post is made on Reddit regarding historical atrocities someone need to insert the United States  past into the comments even if it holds no relevance to the post.\n\n\nAlso the Korean War is a pretty bad example unnecessary war.

The most infamous example being Unit 731.  Even those who weren't experimented on were tortured and had to do forced manual labours.  \n\nSo lots of British, Australian, Canadian, American and other European soldiers suffered greatly at the hands of the Empire of Japan when they were captured after the Asian colonies they tried to defend fell.",

Even if you don\u2019t care about that it\u2019s idiotic to think a full fleet of planes could sneak up on the worlds largest superpower\u2019s most important pacific military installation without making anyone curious. Things are coming out and it\u2019s becoming more and more clear that powerful people knew they had to go to war but they also needed an excuse. They left the boats out. They did it on purpose. They knew it was coming. They attacked us without any warning? No. We made a massacre to server our own purposes. Now I\u2019m Jewish and I have nothing against America entering the war but I\u2019m definitely against people sacrificing their own. Also, why would Japan seal their fate if they had any other options? They knew if they attacked us they would have a significantly lower chance of winning. Why would they do it unless they had no other choice. We may not have officials declared war but we forced their hand.\n\nEdit: source. https://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/washington-whispers/2011/11/29/declassified-memo-hinted-of-1941-hawaii-attack-",

This is particularly true for planes flying low over large bodies of water.\n\nIn addition, if cutting them off from oil was so bad while they fought one war, who would expect them to start a second war over it?!

They needed to attack the US quickly and win every battle afterwards in order to gain their oil.  They saw Americans as week willed and thin skined, unwilling to take casualties.  They believed if they could inflict enough losses on US troops soon after starting war that they could force us to the negotiating table where they would demand oil with the threat of more attacks if the US did not comply.  The Japanise navy was stronger the the US navy at the onset of War.  The US had the ability to mass produce all types of ships whereas the Japanese could not.  They had to attack the US while their navy was weaker than theirs if they were to ever have a chance.  This is why they attacked when they did.  After the war stared they won every engagement right up until the battle of Midway. This would be the turning point in the war.  The US was not sinking Japanese ships faster then they could build them.  The Japanese hoped to cut the US off from their Pacific colonies and inflict enough losses to cause the people to want peace.

There were many legitimate war crimes committed by European, American, and Asian powers during the second world war. Making these kinds of claims only confuses the issue and detracts from where we can make progress by acknowledging actual war crimes and working to prevent them in the future.",

Even though carriers were considered still somewhat of a novelty, that\u2019s a lot of expensive planes and warships the Japanese could ill afford to replace. \n\nI\u2019ll concede that the US did know an attack was probable based on radio activity, but it was suspected it would be on the Philippines and other Pacific islands. They were correct, except the Pearl Harbor attack also occurred. Additionally, the Japanese already had oil from French Indochina (iirc) so the embargo was a problem but a manageable one.",

I imagine some teachers may choose to present it as \"well the Japanese were asking for it,\" but they are especially bad teachers, because they are missing the chance to explore a very real and quite difficult moral quandary. \n\nSaying that the Emperor of Japan was pushing for surrender is true, but slightly misleading. The Emperor did not have practical control over his own military; Japan had been a military junta since at least [1940.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Rule_Assistance_Association) He had been discreetly in favour of peace since at least mid-1944, but there was a legitimate fear that any politician or general who directly advocated peace talks would be assassinated by the senior officers. Even once defeat became inevitable, the prime minister who succeeded Tojo did not want to surrender immediately because they were hoping to negotiate with Russia for better terms than what was offered at Potsdam.  \n\nIn any event, the Emperor didn't push the issue until it was too late; he did not directly order the Supreme Council (the national cabinet) to surrender until after the bombing of Nagasaki had occurred. At that stage the junta was inclined to agree, as Russia had by then invaded Manchuria and made it clear it would not advocate in Japan's favor; even then, there was immediately an attempted coup d'etat the night before the surrender was broadcast.",

We're talking about a regime that didn't care about it's own citizenry let alone the people who they ended up governing by force. What's the value in negotiating with something like that? \n\n> I'm not defending Japan, I'm defending the innocent people killed\n\nOf course no one likes to see innocent people getting killed but entertaining the idea that those who instigate it will be molified is just naive.\n\nWhich of the three major axis powers didn't have to sign an unconditional surrender? Italy. Why? Because some people decided that it was a lost cause and got rid of Mussolini. There were many in the Japanese government and senior military who could have removed the leadership if they weren't going to do what was best for the country.",

That's why the US turned around and didnt accept anything else than a proper surrender, especially with all the crimes Japan did and a huge chunk of them were totally not gonna surrender, ready to fight outsiders irrationally with tooth and nail, even children.\n\nThe bombings where obviously immoral, but not particularly cruel compared to everything else. And it's obvious that the world in general (also the US, largely) consider the Nuclear Bombings a massive tragedy for the world, to the point where people even consider it the worst, without actually knowing it was a small fraction of what people generally were doing in war.",

Something that truly both sides did not need to have in case of well starting up the cold war which had to many close calls as it was. The Japanese didn't want to surrender unconditionally which is what was needed as soon as possible negotiations could take weeks without and no way was Russia going to accept a ceasefire without that they had revenge on their mind from the Russo-Japanese war.",

You might be enlightened by a 1944 report discussing \u201cThe Height of Burst of the Gadget.\u201d Among other things, they wanted as many people dead as possible to prevent those people from doing things like fight the resulting fires. To do this they set the detonation height to have maximum impact against wood and tile houses not more industrial buildings which they knew would be better targeted with a different detonation height.\n\nOf course as you say they had plans to trigger/destroy the nuke if the bomber was shot or nuclear detonation failed, but any military target was more likely to have some anti air flak or other things hit the bomb literally as it fell. The nukes had a metal shell, yes, but detonation was still very touchy and was set to go off at only 500m (Nagasaki) or 600m (Hiroshima). The type 99 88 mm AA gun deployed in defense of the Japanese home islands against Allied air raids was effective to over 10,000m (as you know this did not stop raids, b52s had a service ceiling of over 14,000m but the flak may still be fired as the maximum range of the AA guns was much higher than the effective range)\n\nAny hits against a first gen nuke and the odds of the Japanese (or their allies) having some pieces to reverse engineer went up dramatically. The core itself, if it did not go nuclear, would be quite robust, revealing, and useful to enemies even as just raw material.",

In reality we would have had a total of 12 bombs ready over the few remaining months of that year (including Hiroshima and Nagasaki).\n\nWasting one on an unpopulated area would prove we were not talking about one or two cities, we could produce so many that we didn\u2019t care about leaving so many Japanese alive for an extra few weeks or whatever it would take to make the next bomb.",

This would destroy the intercepted assumption of Admiral Soemu Toyoda from Aug 7.\n\nWe also could have waited longer before the second bomb, and had even planned to give them more time to consider surrender, but cut their time for considering surrender to basically 2 days instead of the planned 5 day \u2014 due to weather it was either 2 days or 7 days to the second bombing and rushing it was chosen.\n\nParticularly choosing to rush the second bombing, I feel the target should have been chosen only to prove beyond a doubt that we can build more, and a pointless target makes that case much sharper.",

What is a war crime, is the intentional murder of civilians. Using a totally unrelated metric, that has nothing to do with the initial argument and that downplays the actual relevant metric by an order of a magnitude (3% compared to 20-25%) is missleading at best and revisionist at worst. You might not have intended it that way, that's why I didn't claim you did. I did however call you out for calling the mass murder of 100-200k civilians a party favor. I am sure you didn't mean it badly. I understand that you wanted to highlight the damage done by conventional bombing, but then you should use a metric that is relevant to the context of war crimes.",

People just aren't that interested in learning about it. Lots of Americans get the *good parts* of their own history wrong; historical literacy in America is shocking in general.",

We don't really have all the details on what the Japanese guy said, but honoring soldiers of the Wehrmacht is not illegal in Germany - in fact there are many memorials on public ground in Germany, usually dedicated to the fallen. Of course, the Japanese may have justified or denied war crimes which would be illegal in Germany.

Nearly  50,000 foreign soldiers are enshrined there as well, to the great displeasure of the decedents of those soldiers who point out (accurately) that their ancestors were enslaved and forced to fight for Japan and that it's pretty grotesque and insulting to say that their ancestors are now transmorgrified into Japanese gods defending Japan eternally in the spiritual world.\n\nIt's also worth noting that Yasukuni is pretty much the only war memorial in the entire country, there is no secular war memorial (at least none worth noting), and the priesthood at Yasukuni is made up exclusively of the furthest right wing ultra-nationalists you will ever have the misfortune to meet. \n\nAlso remember that 4chan is just America's imitation of the original Japanese 2chan, which like 4chan, is made up of pedophile incel far right wing ultra nationalists.",

Why would we try Japanese leadership in a European court in a German city?\n\nJapanese leadership was tried in a court modeled after the Nurnberg trial with representation from participants in the Pacific theater - more representation among the judges than was at Nurnberg, in fact, who only had four judges from the Soviets, UK, US, and France whereas the Tokyo Trials had 11 Judges and included China, Australia, India, Canada, Netherland, New Zealand, and the Philippines along with the UK, US, and Soviets. The US was primarily responsible for prosecution, however.\n\nThroughout the course of post-war Japan and post-war Germany similar economic, political, and military ramifications were imposed, and both countries were administered over by victorious Allied powers, and plenty of criminals were executed on both sides. Executing Unit 731 wouldn\u2019t have suddenly made Japan realize they were the bad guys the entire time.\n\nAs to why Japan and Germany are the way they are today, it\u2019s a complex situation. MacArthur was perhaps too overly concerned with preserving traditional Japanese power structures - but would deposing the Emperor really have prevented imperialist sentiments today, or would their aims simply change to re-instating the Emperor and in the meantime Japan would have been far more hostile to US occupation. The Korean War also messed the situation up.\n\nUltimately, however, I think the fortunes and failures of both countries are their own. Germany struggled and is still struggling to reconcile itself with its past - denazification of Western Germany was initially a failure and former Nazis continued to occupy high positions of government for a long time. The West wiped their hands clean of denazification and left it to Germany in 46 - everything since has been Germany\u2019s own doing. Allied occupation of Japan ended in 52. So blaming America for Japanese neo-Imperialism would be akin to congratulating America for German denazification. Germany\u2019s success is Germany\u2019s own, and Japan\u2019s failure is Japan\u2019s own.",

It is true that the US protected certain criminals from Japan and Germany because we wanted their eugenics and weapons research. After ww2 America was heavily involved in Japan and Germany. There were actually mass efforts to re-educate Japanese POWs by the American government before they were returned. The goal of this program was to create citizens that were in favor of democracy America had a large amount of personal interest in Japan and did a lot to make sure that they would be the sole influencers of the island post war. They kept the emperor because they knew he was a key tool in swaying public opinion. America had a role in creating the Japan we know today. We rewrote their constitution, completely changed the economic and education systems, and backed political entities that aligned with American values. To me it's pretty obvious that we laid the groundwork that lead to the Japanese denialist beliefs through Japanese acceptance and rejection of American instituted policies.",

Remember that the Pacific part of the Japan's involvement in WWII was its fight against America and is filled with glorious last stands of bold and noble Japanese soldiers struggling to defend the Yamato People against the wicked and evil foreigners. \n\nCalling it the Pacific War is a convenient way for Japanese schoolchildren to simply never get an education on what Japan did on mainland Asia by focusing almost entirely on the Pacific campaign. \n\nThere's a lot of Japanese who have, at absolute best, a sort of vague belief that Japan was trying to bring peace and civilization to Korea, China, etc and to drive the European colonizers from those places, and that Japan was the real victim of the war due to the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's a bit like how in America schoolkids never hear about the US/Philippines war because it's glossed over in a rush to get to WWI and fighting the wicked Kaiser to keep Europe free!\n\nOr how, especially in the South where the United Daughters of the Confederacy still have remarkable influence, kids learn all sorts of details about glorious Confederate victories in battle during the War of Northern Aggression, but the class never has time to talk much about slavery.",

They were shocked about it because they were never taught about it. They were very sad and apologetic about what happened. Younger generations probably don't know anything about Japan's atrocities because the truth has been removed from their history books. \n\nI feel like that guy could have brought the conversation in a more civil way. He just comes out as accusatory and smug. Yeah, sure the Japanese have it all wrong but that's not the way to go about it. How many of us have been told you have x, y , z flaws even by our own parents. We will definitely be pissed about it even if its true. He's pretty much disturbing the peace - shows up and cuts in with pointing out things. Just because they were wrong doesn't mean he has a card to be a dick about it.",

Making that data not exactly valuable. That type of medical discoveries can be difficult to verify especially from such sources and it can muddle actual research results and medical conventions if people lean on that old data. \n\nEven without going into these extremes there are similar issues with regular medical research. For example: Until the 1980s doctors thought that babies felt no pain. It was clearly a wrong assumption but it was assumed to be true because of the lack of research on that topic (and some old assumptions simply propagated all while actual medical science advanced in other areas): \n\nhttps://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2017/07/28/when-babies-felt-pain/Lhk2OKonfR4m3TaNjJWV7M/story.html\n\n\nA lot of medical science was also based upon the average male adult body while women (and kids or old people) can have different reaction to medication and procedures and/or results. It was simply not considered important data for long into the 20th century and everybody assumed working of the adult male data set was enough.\n\nIf I remember correctly at some point a specific hormonal birth control (that was intended for women to use) was tested on men because women were not seen as reliable (\"you know how hysterical they can get\" being a reason for that). They simply got the test data from male subjects and guesstimated.",

My grandmother would knit socks to trade with the Japanese soldiers for a handful of rice. Many, many people died in horrific pain and suffering. One of my great aunts passed away in misery.\n\nThese were not brave warriors to be revered. These were cowards attacking innocent people.

There's no solid evidence for them being captured and murdered, or allowed to die in captivity, just supposition. Entirely possible, but so are lots of things.\n\nSoviet figures accounted for under 15% (about 360,000) dying in captivity.  This is reasonable - this is already a ridiculously high number of fatalities, not something to be particularly proud of. If you're going lie and to admit to such numbers, you may as well just tell the truth - at least that way you can claim you successfully took even more prisoners.\n\nThe fact was that the USSR's military did not operate under the policy of screwed up experimentation and genocide that the Japanese and German militaries did. They were certainly worse to prisoners than the Western powers, but in large part, this was due to circumstances, and also because they'd just witnessed those prisoners taking part in an attempt to erase their people from the planet, so were probably lacking in sympathy.",

I was talking about military policy, and specifically said STAVKA. \n\n1) The one million dead prisoners is the *maximum possible number*. This includes *every single German who went missing*. Not every single one was captured. Many were probably simply dead and unidentifiable. Others may have deserted, or got separated from their units. You are going with a massive assumption. If you're claiming a million dead, you need evidence, of which there isn't. The documentary evidence isn't there. \n\nYou can, of course, claim that documents were destroyed, but this is unlikely - the Russian Federation later released documents to Poland admitting to the Katyn Massacre - records were kept of Soviet brutality where it happened. If you did claim such, you are merely saying it was possible. There's no concrete evidence for you to claim it as fact, and the burden is on you to provide the evidence.\n\n2) Claiming the vast amount of deaths in the Ukraine is as bad as the Holocaust is ridiculous. Stalin's policies were horrific, and an attempt to attack opponents, but they were not an attempt to erase Ukrainians from the Earth. This can be seen in that the USSR had a considerable number of Ukrainians in leadership positions.  A disproportionate of Marshals of the Soviet Union, during the war, were of Ukrainian background. \n\nCertainly, a huge amount of people died due to Stalin and the bureaucracy's policy, but the intent was not to erase Ukrainians as a race. If that were the case, the extremely paranoid Stalin, who had officers killed at the drop of a hat, would not have had so many Ukrainian Marshals commanding the USSR's armies during the war (Voroshilov, Timoshenko, Kulik, Malinovsky - 4 of the 15 Marshals during WW2 were Ukrainian. One was Polish (Roskossowsky), two were Georgian (Stalin and Beria) but those two arguably don't count due to not leading troops.).\n\n3) You are talking about the treatment of POWs as genocide. This is ridiculous - even if your claims about one million dead prisoners were true (and there's zero evidence for this), it isn't indicative of genocide. The Soviet Union occupied much of the land of those who had attacked them after the war. This was, of course, not pleasant, but there was no mass murder of ethnic Germans or Slovakians or whoever during the over 40 years of occupation (certainly there was violence and brutal suppression of dissent, but this was not in any way similar to genocide). \n\nYou *could* argue that the Russification of Konigsberg/Kaliningrad could technically fall under such a description, but equating that to the likes of the Holocaust would be going way too far.",

The fact they intentionally starved German POWs to death is the definition of a genocide, just because they didn't kill as many as the Nazis doesn't give them a free pass.

If Stalin (a paranoid monster known for having generals murdered) wanted to erase Ukrainians, he wouldn't have had four of them in the highest military positions.\n\nOne million dead prisoners - where's the evidence? You're going on supposition. We have documentary evidence for the figures being under 400,000. Your statements are based on speculation and filling in gaps of knowledge with what you want to see.\n\nThat is also the case for you stating that they intentionally starved POWs to death (possible, but not on a grand scale). Even if this were the case, it wasn't genocide - East Germany did not face mass death post-war, so wiping out Germans doesn't really appear to have been attempted. I'd argue that the simplest answer is best here - everyone was going hungry in the USSR (unlike any of the Western nations), and genocidal invaders were not prioritised when it came to food.\n\nSaying that \"it's possible that the Soviets killed a million prisoners\" would be correct. It's 100% possible, but we cannot claim any degree of certainty, due to a complete lack of evidence. We have concrete evidence of a large number of atrocities perpetrated by the Stalinist bureaucracy, but for this we have none. I would argue that, generally speaking, the Stalinists kept pretty good records of their atrocities, and we would have this on record, or would at least have a huge trail of witnesses (which we don't - there are plenty of accounts of murdering prisoners, but nothing to indicate such a massive scale).",

Many more kami \u2013 those who fought in opposition to imperial Japan, as well as all war dead regardless of nationality \u2013 are enshrined at Chinreisha.    \n\nOne bonus fact: Yasukuni is a shrine inside a shrine complex. There are multiple shrines. The PMs always visit the [\"Chinreisha\" shrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinreisha) as well, which as it says above even contains people who attacked the Japanese. The whole shrine complex, including Yasukuni, is dedicated to memorializing all kinds of victims of war.",

When he actually made it to the main stage of Japanese politics, the country's sentiments forced him to make an apology. Obviously Abe doesn't feel bad about the war crimes personally, but at the same time Abe was also forced by Japan to acknowledge that the war crimes did happen. The prevailing sentiment in Japan **is** that they feel bad about the war crimes. People like Abe and Inada Tomomi are the weird ones. In fact, [even other Japanese PMs think he's weird](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/10/shinzo-abe-risks-disgracing-japans-people-by-glossing-over-war-record).",

So that\u2019s fair. But on personal levels, like work environments I\u2019ve encountered it much more prominently with Chinese and Japanese workers. They will NOT say \u201cI fucked up, that\u2019s my bad.\u201d Now I am only saying this based off personal experiences in the restaurant industry; but I have heard this both online and word of mouth over my years. Admitting fault is never something I\u2019ve heard them do, but I\u2019ve worked with plenty of other races/cultures that have no problem saying, \u201cthat was me, I messed that up.\u201d Own your mistakes, we are all human, we all make them.

The history of the human race is a brutal one and there are few if any civilisations/countries/peoples that don't have at least some blood on their hands, that was the nature of the past. Being ashamed of the deeds of our ancestors is pointless their view of the world and their beliefs were based in a large part on what we would now consider a lack of knowledge and understanding of how things really are. They did what they believed was right based on how they saw things and what knowledge they had, we have the advantages of greater knowledge and the all important benefit of hindsight, we can see their mistakes and have the choice to avoide doing the same, we know the sun will rise in the morning and we know why, we know our fellow man is is in basic terms no different to us or at least by now we should. We have the collective knowledge and experience of thousands of years and an unrivalled ability to share it and learn from it. The past is exactly that the past, what matters is what we do now.\n\n I am English my ancestors did some terrible things in fact they did a great many terrible things but I am not them. I have done my own wrongs and rights on which I should be judged. The likelihood is some of your ancestors did terrible things. But you are not your ancestors and you are not responsible for what they did, you are responsible for you and what you do and what you think and good or bad those are the things you should be judged on. If you deny the past you do you and mankind a massive disservice, if you accept facts learn from them and act in such ways as not to repeat those parts you believe wrong then even if you fail you are still a credit to the memory of the past mankind and yourself.\n\nMy favourite saying though I have no idea where it originates from is as follows.\n\nLife's ups and downs are not our fault \n       Our reaction to them is.\n\nThough I  could undoubtedly have worded all this far better I hope my point has been understood and is taken in the vain it is ment. We should not forget the past and I would not insult anyone by telling them they should forgive the atrocities that happened but I would say blame the guilty and hold them to account not those who weren't even born when those things happened or we are all to blame for things we didn't do and most of us wouldn't  condone and to me that just seems a tad silly.",

Japan was very isolationist until the U.S. Commodore Perry opened it back up to the West. Americans basically used their naval fleets to force favorable trading conditions, and spread Christianity of course, against a nation that was more-or-less minding their business. \n\nSo Japan was forced to transition from feudalism to an industrial nation over the span of a few decades. It's like giving a toddler a gun. Obviously they committed brutal war crimes that should not be forgotten, but from their perspective they were just playing the same game as western nations but using their own rules. It's like calling native Americans savages because they would scalp their enemies while ignoring the fact that they were essentially fighting foreign invaders. The West loves to apply their own standards of morality and acceptable warfare on people whom they are invading and subjugating.\n\nIf I were japanese, I'd be pretty pissed if a German of all people was lecturing me about war crimes. Yes, Germany currently does a very good job of educating its citizens about their past aggressions. Because they were occupied for decades after the war. Japan was nuked twice. From their perspective, foreigners came in and forcibly changed their entire way of life, they took advantage of the new technology given to them and basically applied the same practices to their neighbors, then the foreigners nuked them to oblivion and rebuilt their country in their own image and judge them for their past atrocities.",

Remember who colonized Asia and Africa. And, remember who stood up alone against the western colonialists to emancipate the Asian population from the western domination. Simply because Japan stood up for justice and freedom in Asia, Japan was regarded as an obstacle to realize the colonization of the entire world by the whites.\n> \n> Just think, say, one Japanese man goes to Arlington Cemetery every year on Memorial Day and all of sudden tells the American families visiting there to pay tribute to the fallen soldiers \"You would be arrested if you beautified the atrocities (Hiroshima massacre, Nagasaki massacre, etc.) your fathers and sons committed against Japan.\" The American families there would certainly get upset about it and would consider it obstructive to their holy and sacred service being conducted there.    \n> \n> Almost all articles treat those who appear in the video attached below, as right wingers or rightists. What they are all saying is that anyone who loves his one own country and wants to defend his own country is a rightist. Particularly every Japanese has to accept all the stories fabricated by the victors in the last war. Otherwise, they are all rightists. This is only a move to weaken Japan and her people, so as to control them as they wish.\n> \n> Anyway, the video says in Japanese that he was taken to the Police Box called \"KOBAN\" based on KOBAN system (now well known in Asia and introduced through Japan's technical cooperation in the area of  Criminal Justice in collaboration with the United Nations). He was questioned at \"KOBAN\" for about two hours and a half. It was found that \ufeffhis name is\ufeff\ufeff Pierre Pariseau and \ufeffhe is a Canadian wood furniture artist.\n> \n> According to the witnesses, he has appeared at Yasukuni Shrine on August 15 for the last four years and has repeatedly obstructed the authorized gathering held at Yasukuni Shrine. He signed a letter of apology addressed to Mr. Tamogami, Yasukuni Shrine and Channel 2 Sakura.                            \n> \n> It seems that this particular Canadian harbors a distorted perception of Japan being the same as \"Nazi-Germany\".  Simply because Japan was tricked into a Tripartite Pact with Nazi-Germany by Adlof Hitler, it does not mean Japan had committed any atrocities as Nazi-Germany.\n> \n> However, it is true that the allied powers used this mere fact of Japan having signed with Nazi-Germany as \"a promotional material\" in such a magnified manner as to defame Japan and her people. One good example I would like to cite here is that a Japanese diplomat saved more than 6,000 Jews from their plight.  Ccompared with a German businessman named Oscar Schindler who saved 1,000 Jews, this Japanese diplomat has not been known to the world because the allied powers find it inconvenient and contradictory to what they have propagated.\n\nhttps://yokohamated.typepad.jp/blog/2011/08/what-canadian-pierre-pariseau-did-.html\n\nSadly this is a very common view in Japan.",

Killing them meant nothing, and they treated it as a sport.\n\nThe worst part, the vast majority of these people they killed had nothing to do with helping the Americans.

Arguably they were worse than the Nazis, because the German army still abided by rules of warfare to spare torture and killing of surrendered enemies. German soldiers wouldn't use their prisoners of war for bayonet practice and everyone knows the number of 6 mil Jews killed in the Holocausts, but few know the number of 10 million civilians killed by the Japanese during the same time period.",

I think the content is relatively neutral.  \nBasically, for the Japanese, that is \"the place where the soldier's parents go to greet the spirit of his son\", and there is only recognition of that. And now, 75 years after the war, it's just a famous place for cherry blossoms in spring.  \nBefore the war, it played the role of \"a place where the spirits of soldiers who died in World War II gather\", so Japanese soldiers (whether they believe or not) said, \"Let's meet in Yasukuni.\" It was a facility like Valhalla that died.  \nTherefore, for a long time after the war, the \"war criminals\" who were responsible for causing the war and causing the war dead in vain were not enshrined there.  \nLater, right-wing forces insisted that \"war criminals also died for Japan,\" and campaigned to worship them, so that people who were found guilty of war criminals in 1978 were together.  \nThis has become a problem in Japan as well, and there was an opposition movement.  \nFor many Japanese, it's just a story of how they deal with a swarm of soldiers who died as a result of their orders in Valhalla, but to the great confusion, for some reason China and South Korea, and In addition, foreigners who were imbued with something insisted that \"Yasukuni is a shrine that worships war criminals\", and while swallowing it, foreigners who thought that \"Yasukuni is such a place\" disappeared. No.  \nIt's completely different. It is an ethically annoying story that \"war criminals have been added\" to the facility that mourns the war dead, and that is originally just a \"warrior's grave\".  \nI'm asking, so I want you to understand that as a premise.  \nTherefore, such a misunderstood gaijin will occur.",

You think you are better than anyone? News: you are not. Everyone has their share in this shit we call 2022. But you are trying to deny yours by throwing mud on other countries' history.

They captured countless females to literally gangbang them for years. They committed horrible experiments on kids! Like testing new \"invented\" viruses. Oh Just a friendly reminder for the American weebs. They actually used what they got from these experiments.\n\n About roughly 70 years ago Japan attempted sending balloon bombs containing deadly viruses and germs to the American mainland aimed to spread an unstoppable pandemic to kill your entire population. Think about it. The cold hard determination behind this. Think about how they carelessly decided this to kill your now grandmas who were possibly just some little innocent girls.\n\nYou guys were so lucky your government had the balls to actually nuke them for revenge. Not only for the soldiers killed and had their body eaten by the Japanese. But also because they even dared to attempt that.      \nWe Asians who literally had our uncles and grand-uncles brutally tortured and dismembered by the Japanese never had the chance for revenge because our countries are weak as hell.\n\n\n\n I always thought the 1st country who hate Japan shouldn't even be China. The US should've been the top country who want their Nazi ass wiped out. For the sake of normal Japanese folks too. They are getting brainwashed HARD. Can you imagine what they taught kids in school about the WWII? Like...just...I don't even know where to start.

Not even Truman approved of this, so it was done with very little involvement of him. There were many things that could have been changed and throwing the bombs on two civilian cities (the Hiroshima bomb was even dropped pretty much on top of a school, were over 400 students lost their lives) was in my opinion *completely* unnecessary. The reason why so many think that it was ok, even necessary, is simply put because the us won the war.",

No, Merkel isn't a far-right leader. \n\nIf you had two brain cells to rub together you'd understand that I meant there are far-right groups in all three countries that deny genocide. I'm not saying that it's a commonly held view in any of them, but it certainly becomes increasingly popular the further right you go.\n\nHonestly it's a surprise you can even remember to breathe at this point; I feel bad that your fellow countrymen have to put up with your idiocy.",
