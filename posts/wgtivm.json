Meanwhile, with men as bosses... the western men in general are very aware of not mis-treating women or giving them a reason to go to HR in these crazy times so they are OVERLY accommodating/lenient (some call it female privilege) so they don't risk their OWN job. Also, like you said... sexual and emotional tactics that benefit women in the work place environment (I am on my period so excuse me not working as hard today = acceptable and if you fire me or give me a warning then DISCRIMINATION!). Also.. women know that most men will sleep with them if given the chance.. so they dangle that carrot for benefits/easier time at work.. stringing them along and them being 'nicer' to them because they think they have a chance.\n\nImportant to note that this only really happens in 'office and white collar/professional' type settings with the companies/businesses who succumb to a lot of the woke/feminist stuff and who are more concerned about the PERCEPTION of the company rather than the business model and making money. They will forgo productivity/efficiency in order to be perceived as 'woke or pro-feminist' etc. Virtue signalling pretty much because they can afford to (not their company, not their profits and to an extent, the perception of the company matters in terms of income generated... or so they believe).\n\nThis doesn't happen in the vast majority of small businesses and in blue collar jobs, whether it be a man or woman running them because there is no time (and time = money) for virtual signalling and telling people how progressive you are with how many women you hire or what leadership roles they occupy... they simply don't have time for it/care for it since it's all about the $$ and whether you bring value or not (or else you will be woke and broke much sooner/much faster).",

Australia. At least in the U.S. you have a somewhat equal opposition to feminists/woke crap in the media (cnn vs fox news as an example). I'm not even saying I like fox news or the far right or whatever... I am saying it's EXTREMELY important to have at least an equal, crazy opposite view expressed in the mainstream to allow people to come to their own conclusions and eventually fall somewhere in the middle/most reasonable positions. When all you hear/see/is promoted is the woke/pro-feminist stuff... without the opposite or even a more 'reasonable view' of the issues... then it is just rational/logical to assume the population will succumb and follow what is seen as most 'normal or popular'.

Queen Ranavalona I: Most Murderous Woman in History https://www.historicmysteries.com/queen-ranavalona-i/\n\n4. Women workers are more mannered right? Meaning they won't bother people. Wrong. Take a look at this video. Men too get sexually harrased.\nhttps://youtu.be/2NQt8V2xnPM\n\n5. Since women are better workers. Then, why not just hire women only? This https://www.letsrun.com/forum/flat_read.php?thread=8638179\n\n6. Women soldiers are terrible https://youtu.be/URGhMw1u7MM\nhttps://youtu.be/FjwtdhpcUzw\nhttps://youtu.be/txX2S80Dt8k\n\n7.Female officers too are terrible. This guy explained it well https://youtu.be/gphzZqXL4-o\n\nAnd yes, long story short. Women leaders suck. Suck it up. It's a universal truth that even God accepts. Even if there are good women leaders. They are exceptions and are like 00.01%. **HARD TO FIND**.",

      "text": "I am a man who has had plenty of bosses that were both men and women. This is all my own experiences so this is only my perspective. Now I want to say that I have both good bosses that were men and good bosses that were women that I liked so I am trying to be fair and equal in my assessment. I have also had terrible bosses that were both men and women.\n\nSo now that I have this out of the way, I am going to tell my experiences from an egalitarian lens and a true egalitarian lens. I have noticed that when it comes to having a man as a boss, things seem a bit easier to communicate issues because even when I'm not 100% clear in what I am saying, they're able to piece together what my thoughts much quicker. This means it's easier to get answers to my problems a lot faster too because male bosses are more likely to tell it to you straight with maybe some sugar coating so your feelings aren't hurt too much if the news isn't good. Also if a male boss is upset, I have learned that he'll yell or talk to you about about and the issue is done and resolved. You give the guy about a half-hour to maybe a full hour and he's calmed down and willing to talk to you with a normal tone.\n\nNow Female bosses are bit of different story. Their communication is clear but they don't always tell things to you straight and it gets annoying plus they often leave answers to questions very open ended that you're double guessing the answer in your head. Also when they are mad, you get yelled at and for the rest of the day, she's going to be pissed off at you. This can be hard to work with because it makes it hard to talk to her especially when I need something from her and she's upset at me to help out. I have seen female bosses go on power trips not because of their egos so much as their insecurities to prove themselves. This gets to be problematic because sometimes I need them to make a decision on something and they're too busy trying to think about the decision instead of just making the decision so we can move forward. However I will give female bosses some credit, like male bosses, they too can jump and get to work if we need help. It doesn't happen all the time but I have seem plenty of my female bosses get on the work floor and start working when we're short staffed.\n\nSo with that said, I still prefer male bosses simply because they're way less emotional in the workspace. I prefer a workplace where there is less emotions in the space especially from the upper management. I personally feel the emotions are what makes some the workplace drama even worse. I don't immediately write off female bosses but I admit I have more of an unconscious bias to be weary of their motives. I listen to the female bosses just as much as I listen to the male bosses but I know many female bosses feel like they need to prove themselves to be competent and not some kind of diversity promotion or diversity hire.",

There are thousands of variables that go into how \"well\" the pandemic was handled, I remember reading how this study was debunked once they accounted for confounding variables. I could easily say that more egalitarian countries are more first world, meaning better healthcare, meaning less deaths. \n\nPoint #2: Companies who have a better gender balance do better - How does this mean women are better leaders? It could have more to do with having a larger hiring pool. Which has always been the concept in egalitarian cultures. (There may be separate downsides though) \n\nPoint #3: Women are hired in the public sector - The public sector is notoriously useless are the opposite of a meritocracy. \n\n>despite the research pointing to the embarrassingly emotional, testosterone-driven relationship men have with risk.\n\nThis article is clearly biased.",

      "text": "It's unfortunate neither the interviewee nor apparently anyone here in the comments has actually looked at the Gallup data.\n\nUnless some significant shift away from the trend has happened in the past few years, as of 2017 almost equal percentages of women prefer to work for a male vs. female boss, with almost half (the most common response) being no preference either way.[1]\n\nDon't know which studies this woman is referring to, but the highest percentage of preference for a male boss among women respondents ever recorded by Gallup was 60%, and that was almost 50 years ago. It's been trending down ever since. Would really like to see the studies to determine the possible causes for the different results.\n\n[1]https://news.gallup.com/poll/222425/americans-no-longer-prefer-male-boss-female-boss.aspx",

      "text": "You know all those diversity training courses we take that go through things like unconscious bias? One thing that struck me about them recently is if you look at the examples provided in these courses, you almost never see examples where a straight white man is in the role of \"victim\" or person being incorrectly judged. \n\nHere's the thing I find sort of funny about this. If a straight white man is the boss, he understands others like him and these training courses help him bridge the gap with other groups because he has clear examples he's been given - the training helps him be a better boss. If by contrast the boss is a visible minority woman, the training helps her understand some people, but not all, and in a western country, she's probably going to have a fair number of straight white dudes working for her and a bunch of white women. My point is, these programs do not train visible minority women to wield power effectively and fairly as well as it does white men, which is clearly unintentional.",
