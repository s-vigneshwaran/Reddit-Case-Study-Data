              "text": "In the Bible, in the book of Matthew, chapters 5-7 are the sermon on the mount. Jesus went and did teachings there. If you take some time to skim through it, you'll see that most self-identified Christians do not follow Jesus' teachings from these crucial chapters. **The original poster quoted Chapter 6:6. You're missing the first part of it. To understand it better, you need to start at 6:5 and read forward**: \u201cAnd when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. 6 But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJesus is saying that the people who pray in the streets in public and make a big scene of it are basically breaking the rules. \"They have received their reward in full,\" which is to say that they're winning the adoration of people around them. They're doing it for spectacle. The reward is \"in full\" because they won't get any more rewards beyond that because it displeases god. He specifically calls these people \"hypocrites,\" as you saw. Instead, they're supposed to go into a private space to pray to god....\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Message version of the Bible offers this modernized layman's version of it: \n\n\u201cAnd when you come before God, don\u2019t turn that into a theatrical production either. All these people making a regular show out of their prayers, hoping for fifteen minutes of fame! Do you think God sits in a box seat? 6 \u201cHere\u2019s what I want you to do: Find a quiet, secluded place so you won\u2019t be tempted to role-play before God. Just be there as simply and honestly as you can manage. The focus will shift from you to God, and you will begin to sense his grace.\"\n\n\u200b So... according to Jesus himself, Christians shouldn't be using an open space in public, like a football field in front of a massive crowd, to pray to god. Funny, right? Oh, and you mentioned sermons earlier. A sermon is meant to be a lesson, like a speech, delivered by a religious leader. Prayer is when you talk specifically to god to offer thanks or ask for help, etc. \n\nI grew up agnostic with a vehement hatred of Christianity, then, somewhat absurdly, became involved with the church in my late 20s, then, a year ago, lost all faith. I will say that the community was very progressive/liberal and kind, and I do wish there was an equivalent for atheists. Some kind of community gathering weekly that is just about affirming your values and reorienting yourself and engaging in some self-care because the world is just fucking crazy. I very much miss the community aspect. I will also say that there *are* people out there who are trying hard to live by Jesus' teachings, but in my observation, they are the extreme minority. I do not feel fondly toward the religion because I am sick of the rampant, blatant hypocrisy at large. I loathed that all along. \u200b Anyway, I hope this helped you understand the context. Take care o/",

Let us demand that individuals be judged for their concrete actions, not their fealty to arbitrary social norms and illusory categorizations. Let us reason our solutions with agnosticism in all things, holding fast only to that which is demonstrably true. Let us stand firm against any and all arbitrary authority that threatens the personal sovereignty of one or all.

I personally don't see why this is a big deal. If the kids were forced into doing it with possible punishment, then yeah that's no good, but coercion isn't exactly clear. Was it coercion with the idea that they wouldn't play? Or just scrutiny among peers? \n\nPersonally i find this ruling to be okay. I believe this to be a matter of religious freedom as long as all other religions are equally accepted in similar circumstances. Although, I am iffy about mixing public schools and religion, it's not like this was in class, or taught, or anything like that. It was an after-school event where the coach led a prayer. Depending on how \"coerced\" the non-participants were and to what degree, the ruling itself seems fine.",

Trans support and understanding is still in it's infancy. We still have people who say things like \"Well, of course we should treat them with respect and call them by chosen names and pronouns!........***BUT*** they're ***REALLY*** <assigned gender at birth> so <denial of rights> makes sense!\" \n\nThis isn't helped by conservatives stoking the fire with sports bans (that affect ~1-2 students in an entire state) and specifically targeting these things to drive a wedge between liberals and transfolk. Divide and conquer still works in 2022. \n\nCishet liberals who want to be supportive need to get better understandings of the medical facts at play, because a lot of them are counter to what people's \"gut feelings\" are. Especially as it pertains to youth gender identity and transition. Trans youth are by far and away the most at-risk and they're under vicious attack by Republicans trying to outlaw standard medical treatment by dubbing it \"radical\" when it isn't and never has been radical, they just don't like that trans people exist.",

I am an atheist but I read and try to understand why people of religion do and think how they do. Once you do this, understanding why you are an atheist becomes a lot clearer.",

And what's the benefit I get from this? I can call out religious people on some of the slightly more obscure points of their bullshit. *Absolutely* not worth it.",

It all has to be allowed, correct? That's what these laws are for, right? Religious freedom cannot be just for one faith and no one else.\n\nAs much as I want to launch into a vitriolic rant against the world, it's pointless. So, why not challenge these laws by putting them to use? I so want to see every single non-evangelical christian, who works in public schools, really push this matter. Peacefully and respectfully, express their faith openly in front of the children of these jesus freaks. Make these god damn religious hypocrites explain why they are mad, if they still are getting their way.\n\nOutside of just resorting to all-out violence, which is where I see things heading anyway, I don't know how else we can fight back, other than to play the game.\n\nI'm infuriated and incredibly disgusted by what is happening to this country. The level of hatred I feel towards certain types right now is almost making me physically ill. I want so badly to do something to express my outrage, but it feels like there's nothing that will get through to these fucking pieces of shit.\n\nIf you try talking to them, they just ignore you and make excuses. If you rally and protest, they make up lies and label you a threat. If you try to get the laws changed, by voting for people who say they will fight, they claim elections were stolen.\n\nNo level of rationality or common sense works. They always see themselves as the victim and that makes them dangerous. They're stupid, they're afraid, they believe whatever bullshit they can find that supports their worldview, and they are armed. People are gonna die because of these fucking cunts and there isn't a single person in a position of power that can or will do anything about it. \n\nThe lunatics are winning.

They aren't afraid to say and do the most heinous things because they believe they're right. They believe they're in danger. They believe the world can't touch them.\n\nAll of the ugliness is exhausting. What really gets me, is how these fuckers will act up and get called out for it. Then they immediately claim they're the victim. They'll counter with some bullshit like, \"I thought you were supposed to be the tolerant ones.\" They'll claim any attempts at holding them accountable is actually an attack on their values, their faith, their way of life. They will do everything they can to provoke a reaction, just so they can say we're no better than them, because we responded with aggression.\n\nTrust me, I have lots of dark and morbid thoughts about very specific people, but I know violence will solve nothing. I do fear violence is inevitable though and they will be the ones who start it. They have weaponized fear and they're just waiting for an excuse to take a shot. I hope I'm wrong, that I'm just overreacting. I really want to see these people exposed, removed from positions of power, held accountable, and shamed out of society for good. There has to be a way, but I just don't know if we have any fight left in us. I don't, at least.",

As long as scriptures arent being used in the curriculum then this protected.\n\nSeparation of Church and State didnt face a \"setback\" it was upheld as it was designed. The constitution doesnt protect people from the church, it protects the church from the government. Simple as that.
