All that will do is put more strain on the system and make a kid that is full of trauma and issues. And recent news in the US shows what that creates...",

Kids walk or take the bus to school. School shootings don't happen. We have healthcare.

What I meant is the French baccalaureate degree is recognized worldwide.

When I was looking into schools in Canada, it was the same thing. I don\u2019t remember too much now as it\u2019s been a few years, but I was even looking at studying in the Netherlands and I believe some of my high school credits would transfer over. I was more talking about that part of education. \n\nHowever, you\u2019re right about the more social aspect that teachers (and administration) aren\u2019t trained for. In my experience, bullying wasn\u2019t taken seriously (in the US it\u2019s really not much better, but again this is just my experience), accommodations for medical conditions/disabilities were not up to par and some teachers were just straight up awful.

I think it would be more fair to compare the US to an equivalent country. Anytime I bring up how I don't want to live in the US, my husband always says - \"You don't know how good you have it over here\". Like, yeah - I'm not saying I want to move from a first world country to a third world country. I would want to move to somewhere comparable, but to a place where there aren't mass shootings every day and a bunch of hicks with old school opinions taking away basic human rights while also not giving them enough means to escape poverty.",

Europe has many benefits that North America simply doesn\u2019t and it goes beyond things like education. It\u2019s easier to be physically fit because of how walkable many European cities are. Here in NA if you don\u2019t have a vehicle you\u2019re kind of fucked. And stuck. It is very hard to get anywhere -  even locally - without a car. As an example our local bus system has its last run at 7:45 pm, as though people don\u2019t need the bus passed 8. You betcha there\u2019s a lot of DUI convictions here. It used to run until 10 and 12 on weekends, but I guess there\u2019s not enough ridership because, you guessed it, the majority drive. And during the day the buses come to each stop on the hour, and every half hour around 4-6. So if you\u2019re heading to work and miss your bus, again, you\u2019re fucked.",

Northern Alberta is friendlier to the indigenous since more of us are up there, and Yellowknife is very native, and a lovely place but the prices are much higher there because of the cost to transport food up there. Most people go to Edmonton for shopping or to move somewhere big with a lot of resources not found in the more northern parts, which I would say is medium friendly to natives - again it\u2019s a numbers game. Lots of my family live in Edmonton, Lac la Biche, but Fort McMurray, and Fort McKay. But as you go south from Edmonton, if your Native, metis or treaty, you\u2019re gonna have a bad time. Not like \u201cI\u2019m never going there ever\u201d bad time, just in places like Red Deer, Calgary and Lethbridge, people are less polite and less inclined to start a conversation with me. In the 4 years I lived in Calgary I was only able to make friends with other native people.\n\nIn spite of that, I still think Calgary is a beautiful city and recommend people live there at least once regardless. Hey, maybe it was me! Maybe there was something besides my race that made me seem undesirable. It just seems odd that my experience in different regions is so consistent to those localities",

Adoption can look an awful lot like human trafficking, especially when you look at the history and get into the little details.",

Good on you for being willing to learn, it can be uncomfortable!! \n\nI\u2019m white presenting and it was thought of as a favor (at the time) to remove that information. It is rooted in white supremacy - like the \u201ckill the Indian, save the man\u201d mentality. They erased part of who I was to bring me closer to whiteness. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t say they sold me \u201clike a slave.\u201d It is more like how the fancy shelter charges you like $500 when you adopt a purebred kitten or puppy, except it\u2019s much *much* more money and they aren\u2019t responsible for feeding or sheltering the child or birth mother (so it\u2019s a bit curious why they make so much.)\n\nMy adoptive parents had already worked with an agency and had an adoption fall through, so they had filled out all the paperwork on their end. Some adoption paperwork specifically asks what race the adoptive parents prefer and how strong they feel about their answer. The same goes for disability. My paperwork specifically stated my parents did not want a baby of any other race besides white, including a mixed race child (me,) and they didn\u2019t want a drug addicts baby (me.) \n\n\nSo in my case the agency was genuinely useless. They did almost nothing but fill out and fudge the documentation to make me line up with the paperwork my adoptive parents filled out prior to finding out about me. The agency likely made more money by removing my health and background information. (They had magically turned me into an abled white baby on paper.) It\u2019s especially strange in my case because *my adoptive parents had heard about me through the grape vine* (they were related to one of the healthcare professionals involved with my delivery,) so there really was no need for the agency to be involved. Since their job is finding babies for adoptive parents and my parents managed that themselves. \n\nI\u2019m moving soon to be closer to my first family. Sadly all these years they were under the impression that the adoption was open. My adoptive parents told me it was closed. They had wanted to know me my whole life, and I them. There are so many lies. The whole experience has been extremely damaging for me, for my mental health, for my identity, for my adoptive parents who didn\u2019t get the baby they overpaid for, and for my biological/ first family (mom, sisters, aunts, uncles, grandparents, even great grandparents) who missed me. Adoption can be extremely traumatic and horrible, even if your adoptive family is wonderful, (some of mine were amazing) or your biological family is horrible. \n\nHistorically adoption been used as a tool of cultural genocide against indigenous people, and that trauma played out in my birth family cyclically. I am the descendant of a child bride who had a child taken from her against her will. She\u2019s my great grandma. We are just now beginning to understand the emotional effects of adoption and the trauma it can leave behind. Even if everything is done right with good intentions. \n\nMy birth mother should have felt safe getting an abortion. She should have been able to make a guilt free decision. Instead she was coerced into having me - a rapists baby, while she was on drugs, and then coerced into giving me up. My existence caused more pain than joy, and I say that as someone who is happy to still be here and *extremely* loved. By both families. \n\nAbortion is harm reduction.\n\nEta: Yes they were infertile and adoption was a last resort. They didn\u2019t force me to work, exactly. I guess I was expected to clean up after my mom and their daughter. They pressured me to be grateful for having jumped in social class too, but in a way where I was not allowed to express negative feelings about the adoption, and expected to express my gratitude publicly. I was a wonderful virtue signaling prop because everyone told them how amazing they were to have saved an unwanted baby. But I grew up getting treated like an unwelcome guest in their house. They had a daughter via IVF when I was 3, and I was not allowed boundaries from her or my adoptive mom. (The daughter hit and hit me.) She (adoptive mom) didn\u2019t see us both as her children, like the research said she would. Instead she saw me as competition for resources and was unable to bond with me. She was extremely emotionally abusive, and punished me when my issues (ADHD / anxiety / depression became apparent.) We are in a place now where she\u2019s apologized and acknowledged all this. \n\nI was the scapegoat of the family, and ultimately I spent my teen years in an institution with a disproportionate number of adopted kids. (Many had non adopted siblings living at home.) I was abused there too and some of my friends, (who were there in foster care,) ended up as trafficking victims. My parents signed over their rights so the state would pay for the school, but many rich parents are paying essentially as much as college tuition to have their \u201ctroubled\u201d kids traumatized in these facilities. (That\u2019s what happened to Paris Hilton.) Adopted kids make up a ridiculous number of these kids. Something like 20%-30% of the kids at my second facility were adopted. Sorry for the edit I realized I didn\u2019t answer your question at all and got lost in my ramble.",

Originally, the authors of the constitution believed a bill of rights might be dangerous because it may encourage the government to seek work arounds, such as using the fact that we can\u2019t yell fire in a theater (which is a good thing obv) as precedent for implementing laws that would then hinder or directly attack the first amendment. The 9th is essentially a shield for the first 10 that also technically makes gun laws illegal (which would be a bad thing obv). Unfortunately since nothing in the bill of rights even comes close to protecting any form of healthcare or anything even remotely adjacent to abortion, the 9th amendment does not protect it. And that\u2019s why abortion is a states rights issue and not a federal issue, because it also prevents federal overreach concerning abortion. Now there are places in America where abortion will always be legal because the federal government will never have a say in whether or not you can have one (which is a good thing). Besides, we don\u2019t want non constitutional rulings to stand in the Supreme Court anyway, that only makes it easier for them to do things like rule that the second amendment protects the right to own and operate a tank, which would be valid based on your interpretation of the 9th amendment.",

The difference between you and me is that I\u2019m smart enough to know that anything that gives the federal government and ounce of authority or power over anything beyond defense and commerce is inherently evil. If I had my way, we would move to a model in which the states held all of the power and the only thing the fed would have authority over would be defense and commerce. Then everyone gets what they want. You can have your free healthcare in California, and I won\u2019t have to pay for it. Government always performs better on a more local level anyway.\n\nedit: but that\u2019s not realistic, so I\u2019m all for term limits in Congress, bill limits of 10 pages, making it illegal for any politician to invest in any company, and a locked income for public SERVANTS in congress at 40-50k hell maybe even minimum wage. They aren\u2019t our bosses, we\u2019re theirs and we need to take that authority back.",

Equipment, for example. \n\nAt one school, microscopes for everyone in. Science class. \n\nNext school, one microscope. The entire class had to file by and take turns. \n\nThen, Catholic school; private elementary school. It was two years ahead of public elementary school, easily. \n\nThink about that. The aborted future or nitrous accelerant those educational years represent. \n\nThe other outrageous note is that those years , the early years until middle school, are supposed to be for a child to find her/his way. \nI\u2019ve read so many stories where parents are frantically trying to enroll their unborn children into waiting lists for prestigious preschools\u2014not because kids get to make their own kaleidoscopes, choosing from lovely scraps and tiny gleaming things, so they \n can *discover* the inner workings of one little world\u2014but because the preschool will help their children get into better colleges down the line, to earn a better living, so  that when they have kids, they can get into better 6 month-old baby daycare, then better\u2014-hey, I know there\u2019s a circle of life, but this is just different levels of factory farming,  which is another\u2026ah, screw it.",

Someone says how will god punish these people. That was an answer. It would be just like a miscarriage. Do you know the difference between a baby dying naturally and a doctor going in cutting it up and sucking I out with a vacuum? \n\nJoshua 6:21 = it was a story about a siege. That is what bad people do when they siege a piece of land. Bad people do bad. That was not the Bible saying going and getting an abortion was ok. \n\nI can go on if you need me too. But none of your evidence was the Bible saying that cutting up children was ok. If anything you just took some text out of context. At most you can say the Bible mentions it, but it still doesn\u2019t support it.",

Now instead of thinking of arguments that completely ignore what their actual argument is, focus on arguing that a bunch of cells feeding on the mother's nutrients is not a real person. And when they argue that it will become a person, tell them that an egg 10 years from now would've become a person with a good life and now it's going to get killed because the mother can't afford another kid after the first one ruining her chances at establishing a career.

Is that murder? \n\nIf you really want to get down to it and this is where you draw your line... Anyone that's living is a murderer because our bodies digest bacteria, LIVING plant matter, and animals every single day.

So why should they be punished because of peoples actions? \nIs punishment for them death because people don\u2019t want to accept reactions of their actions? \n\nIs that not psychopathic? Just do whatever without care of what happens?",

But this is the last time, because if it still doesn\u2019t get through to you then you shall believe what you believe and I shall do the same. So please have an open mind when reading so there is less confusion and or frustration. \n\nThere is 100% a problem with comparing a baby to an std, however in my response to you I did no such thing. The comparison I was making is the accountability people must have when being sexually active. \n\nLike I said before sex is not a crime and neither is knowingly giving someone an std. but morally if someone were to do this that would be wrong of them? \n\nWhy would it be wrong of them? Because they are not being responsible and endangering another life for their own satisfaction. \n\nHow does this relate to people having sex and aborting the babies? \n\nBecause people that have sex without being responsible for the outcomes that sex has are morally in the wrong. \n\nWhy are they in the wrong? Because they will endanger/ kill another life for their own satisfactions. The satisfaction is having sex. Fully knowing that having sex can lead to becoming pregnant and creating a life. \n\nConsequence by definition is \u201csomething produced by a cause or necessarily following from a set of conditions\u201d (https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/consequence) \n\nWhen having sex you are meeting the requirements of becoming pregnant and what is produced is a child. \n\nSo for those that engage in sex knowing that they can get pregnant and have a child but decide to abort the baby because they do not want to be responsible for the consequences of sex are morally in the wrong. \n\nThe people that wish to satisfy their desires instead of being accountable for their actions, are the same kind of people that would knowingly give people an std, or have sex without getting their sexual partner tested to indulge in their own desires without care of the other lives in the process. \n\nAnti-abortion is about holding people accountable for their actions. Having sex and children is a privilege that shouldn\u2019t be taken advantage of. It\u2019s serious and people that abort their children don\u2019t want to handle the seriousness of sex but want the benefits. \n\nHope this helps explain or clarify more. \n\nIf not then I wish you peace.",

It could be even more common if we invested more resources into it as a society.\n\nWhy are you being so demanding of exact figures etc. It's like you're looking for something to pounce on to further your argument.

Girl gets raped, humiliated, innocence destroyed, if she was religious then her whole life has been tainted for not being a virgin until marriage, she won't be able to see men the same way, her dreams of a perfect future crumble in front of her eyes and then she gets the horrible news that her assailant also left her with the burden of his child, for the girl it must be like carrying the rotten essense of the man who stole everything from her, she feels anger and hopelessness in the world when the government tells her that if she tries to take away this burden in hopes to have a normal and better life then she is a murdering criminal who would face even worst  charges than the rapist that put her in this situation. I bet those links and stats will be no more help to her when her liberties have also been violated. I am not a woman, I can't ever be put in the same shoes as someone like this girl to be able to truly understand what they are going through, but I also wish to be able to have the simple right of being in control of my own body, that my body is my temple and only I should be in charge to decide what I want to do with it, and to be honest, if I found myself as one in an ever more increasing dystopian world for women like it is happening more and more every year then I would actually be considering jumping off my 8th floor. 9 months to carry a child are not something to be brushed over, it is not an \"option\" just cuz adoption is a possibility, you still have to carry that baby to term, and give birth to it, one of the scariest things in a woman's life, the pain is hard to even describe and the stress in the body can cause the death of the mother herself, just giving birth is not as simple as just \"Oh its cool, just carry it for 9 months and then give it away for adoption, problem solved!

We're living in the best of times of all human history for both men and women.\n\nRape is a very emotional subject and it destroys lives, but it doesn't justify killing and innocent life. In no other area of life would we kill a child to avoid emotional suffering of another person no matter how traumatic.\n\nI know, it's just a \"clump of cells\" right? That's why none of what you said holds any weight with me personally on this question, because we disagree on the fundamental variable of the whole question. No amount of suffering by one person will justify the killing of another innocent person.\n\nI'm not dismissing that suffering in any way, I'm just stating that there's no way for it to supersede the life of another person.",

We wouldn't even begin to consider killing that infant. It's not guilty of anything. We would just try to minimize the damage at that point with support and therapy.\n\nThe only question that's up for debate in my opinion is when does a human life start.

It\u2019s not my infant. If an abortion happens I would mourn the loss, but I have to believe that the decision was made with all ethical concerns in mind, of the mother the close family involved, and yes, even the baby. Because it IS an ethically challenging decision to make, I\u2019m not aware of all the circumstances, and I don\u2019t claim to know the answer.  \nSo yeah.  \nI think we can both agree tho that rape should be the thing we try to prevent.",

My objection is people who look at someone who truly believes life starts at whatever point, and then claim all of these ulterior motives to their stance.\n\nPeople seem to think that because they don't have a strong belief of when life starts that nobody else does, and therefore it's not really about saving a human life, it must be about something else.\n\nBut if you accept that people truly believe a human life is being murdered, the debate changes and is a lot less inflammatory.",

They do this because they aren't allowed to find out gender beforehand and they only want to raise boys.\n\nI suspect you would consider this murder, and I suspect you wouldn't accept the argument that it's just your opinion so you should stay out of it. Correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nIf you're curious about this there's a documentary by BBC on youtube that interviews many of these women. It's worth a watch.

Not some pieced together solution where politicians buddies get rich and kids suffer for profits.

So there is plenty of room to argue on that alone. \n\nBut some people probably don\u2019t even need that belief to be pro-choice, especially in cases of rape or incest because of a few things:\n\n- pregnancy really fucks up your body\n\n- restricting abortion access also tends to restrict it to when people need them medically (notice that many laws have been drafted in the US where ectopic pregnancies aren\u2019t eligible exceptions)\n\n- in some states they\u2019ve drafted up bills (even passed a few) that allow for women who have had miscarriages or stillbirths to be investigated for inducing abortion or even full on homicide \n\n- the state of foster care and adoption is horrific in the United States \n\n- the people who are pushing for these laws are largely against things like social programs that help these kids, access to education and opportunity, and a plethora of other approaches to society that ensure a person\u2019s happiness and safety, even if only in childhood. \n\nBut I get if you\u2019re religious or otherwise believe that life begins at conception the other points aren\u2019t necessarily quite as important. Although it would be nice to at least see the bulk of the anti-choice people making significant headway on any of those issues instead of actively working against nearly any social program.",

So from my perspective, actively pushing legislation that bans abortion while just generally wanting to do more for pregnant women, mothers, and children in society is not enough. Those people should at least push for better circumstances for children, mothers, and pregnant women then *before* trying to ban abortion. \n\nThough as I mentioned, we just fundamentally disagree on the first part that your viewpoint hinges on, which at least lets us either address that or agree to disagree and move on to what people agree is an issue on either side. \n\nThe parts about laws regarding abortion being written by people who don\u2019t even understand that ectopic pregnancies are lethal and non-viable, and the laws regarding miscarriages, still births, and/or birth control as either abortion or homicide are still relevant issues, whether or not we agree if a fetus or fertilized egg is a life.",

There's many circumstances in which doing so may even be the ethical choice. \n\nYou're arguing morals when we need to be arguing legality. Just because you personally don't like something doesn't mean it should be illegal. Sometimes we need to separate the two.\n\nMurder is illegal because of the impact it has on society and the people around the victim. You're often taking away someone's companion or a family's provider and whatnot. There's lots of very real reasons and incentives not to have it be legal to murder a living person.\n\nAbortion, on the other hand, affects only the parents, who have consented and agreed that not having a child is the best decision. Otherwise, abortion just keeps the status quo. Grandparents don't lose anything, because they never had something to begin with. You're not taking away something from other people. A fetus at that stage doesn't think or feel pain, so it has no opinions on the matter. \n\nSo why should an abortion be *illegal*? Why should the government prevent a person from having an abortion? What consequences does an abortion have that justifies an outright ban?  \"I personally feel bad\" isn't a good reason, because you don't have to get an abortion if you don't want to.",

Murder should be illegal even if you murder some guy out in the jungle that has never made contact with another human being.\n\nLegal is based on morality. There's no point otherwise. If you take morality away from legal, you can make a very strong argument for killing off all the weaker members of society. Especially if they have no significant connections to the people you allow to continue living. We could solve overpopulation real quick.\n\nThat old guy in the rest home that nobody ever visits, flip the switch, nobody loses anything, and there's no negative consequences to any living person. We even save some resources, win-win.\n\nI mean just because you feel bad if we flip the switch, that's not reason enough to keep him alive legally, morality be damned right?\n\nEdit: almost forgot, the life support question is supposed to assume the person is very much expected to recover, still ethical?",

Pregnancy weakens a mothers immune system making her more susceptible to all kinds of viral and bacterial illnesses, some of which can cause devastating birth defects or kill the mother. It increases the likelihood of stroke and blood clotting disorders, which can kill. It can induce diabetes. It can cause eclampsia, which kills. Ectopic pregnancies can kill, as can the simple act of miscarrying without medical intervention. Many abortion laws being passed now in anticipation of overturning Roe, outlaw treating miscarriage and prioritize saving the fetus over the mother. Pro-mother-killing activists literally said saving the life of the mother is a loophole around abortion bans so they\u2019re making saving pregnant women experiencing miscarriage illegal.\n\nThis is a hellscape that will result in millions of deaths of post-born, full developed adult fetuses otherwise known as women. Women like your wife, your sister, your best friend and even your daughter. None of them have the right to life when abortion is outlawed. Their life becomes second to a non-viable clump of cells.

In January, a Florida judge denied a 17 year old from getting an abortion because [her GPA wasn't high enough.](https://www.vice.com/en/article/akv7xg/judge-abortion-gpa) The judge also cited that she didn't pay her cell phone bill so she wasn't financially stable and that she doesn't care for any younger family members so they aren't able to evaluate her emotional stability. \n\nWhat makes this appalling (even moreso than it already is): the woman was working a 20 hr job *while still in high school* and was paying for pretty much everything *but* the phone bill. Also, she didn't even have any younger siblings to care for in the first place.\n\nThankfully, that ruling was appealed and the appeals court overturned the initial judges denial. \n\nSome other notable denials of abortion in other cases include: a girl in foster care shouldn't get an abortion because she was \"financially dependent on *her parents;*\" getting pregnant by accident means you're too immature for an abortion; a girl's catholic parents might be distressed if they found out she had an abortion (note: the entire point of getting a judge's approval is *because* you can't get your parent's permission for an abortion); another girl in foster care was deemed not self-sufficient (she raised her younger siblings because her parents weren't around)........\n\nThese judges are making arguments for why they aren't able to support a baby, but then turn around and force them to have that child. All because an abortion might be distressing to them. They're reasoning that an abortion is too traumatic and emotionally painful, but giving your child up for adoption is apparently perfectly fine and not painful at all",

The doctors told her that it was an unviable pregnancy, and under doctor supervision were given a chemically induced abortion.\n\nOtherwise there was a very good chance she would die.\n\nThe abortion actually only worked 50%. Only one fetus was aborted. We ended up finding out about two months later. At this point, the doctors told us the danger was pretty much gone for her at this point since she would be approaching the second trimester soon.\n\nSix months later our son was born.\n\nIt was pretty rough.

You seem to be drawing arbitrary lines wherever you think they\u2019ll benefit your argument. You draw the line where you *feel* it should be drawn. It\u2019s not based on anything rational. You\u2019ve decided \u201cabortion=baby murder\u201d and then attempted to construct an argument around that instead of absorbing facts and coming to a conclusion. There\u2019s no arguing with people that do something like that, but it was worth a shot I guess lol",

Would you rather risk the death of both?\n\nWhat if the child is essentially destined for an orphanage because the mother and father are shitheads? An entire 20 year span of abuse and hatred let out into one child that you've doomed.\n\nBut no, that's no one's call to make, a fetus is a person. Common sense be damned, a fetus is a person. Born without a face? You'll be happy. Alive is better than dead in 100% of circumstances, isn't it? Regardless of the consequences, regardless of the pain it will cause others, that's your viewpoint.\n\nWhat about rape? Do you want a child living in a world where it is resented every moment of it's life, to a family that in no way had any intention of having much less raising a child?\n\nThen there's the religious paradox. If life is sacred, and a fetus is a person, then how can any one child's fate be death? If a child isn't fated to be aborted, then how was it that god allowed it? Are we only going to honor the good deeds and ignore the bad? Is it our fault for taking the action or god's for not stopping it?\n\nBut no.\n\nNope.\n\nFuck all that. I know what I know. I know what's morally true. A fetus is a person. Consequences, actions taken, people involved be damned. Torture it for its entire life but don't kill it, whatever you do. No fate is worse!\n\nIt's silly. It's absolutely silly. There are so many fates worse than death. Abortions aren't murder. If anything in most circumstances, they're mercy.\n\nYou want abortions banned? Then vote for every woman forced to have a child to be put on government-funded child support until it's 18 and make every American pay for it.\n\nOh? That's not your problem? You should you have a... **choice** in the matter? Funny how it all wraps around, isn't it?",

I just don't get why people focus on if it's a \"person\"\u2014what even is a person, and at what point?\u2014or how developed it is. Like if you're really going by if it can survive on its own, does that mean babies that need an incubator aren't people yet?\n\nSee how dumb this gets? And it really is pointless, as I find it hard to believe that many people base their abortion views on this.\n\nGestational limits don't even make sense as a compromise. How can there be an in between? How could a pro-lifer think it's not killing a person as long as it's young enough? And a pro-choicer saying they can't have/raise a kid, but oh hey, now that it's reached 5 months, I guess I can! What?",

Insisting a couple of cells is somehow a person, and the fully formed woman it is inhabiting must be forced to carry it? At what cost? Should a woman be forced to continue being pregnant if her life is at risk? Should a woman who did not choose to get pregnant be forced to give birth? Should children be forced to give birth? Does a girl/woman lose her human value at conception as well? Why does it seem like a clump of cells always has more value to pro-life people? What makes an adult person less valuable than something that doesn't even have a heartbeat or organs yet, that might not survive long enough to attach to the uterus? Many fertilized eggs don't even survive past being zygotes. What of the natural abortions that occur through spontaneous miscarriage? Who gets to be responsible for those? Should the man responsible for getting a woman pregnant be forced to be with that woman since he also chose to have sex? He was also aware of the risks. Should only the woman have to live with the consequences of both people involved? What about pregnancies from failed contraceptive devices?\n\nLife beginning (or continuing, in some arguments) at conception is something I can understand, cells are indeed alive, but it'll be harder to convince me that at conception that life should be considered a person, especially considering how many of those \"people\" never make it beyond being a fertilized egg, and how so many pro-life people stop caring about those lives after they're born.  \n\n\nEdit: Deleted your account?

Thats before considering the time pressure involved.\n\nMinors who \"don't have (supportive) parents\" are a particularly vulnerable group and absolutely don't deserve being forced to deal with even more shit than the minors that have a support system. Especially more shit that's all about delaying their termination indefinitely. \n\n> Also nobody is playing into anything\n\nOfc thats what you're doing if you're presenting this as a valid alternative and not actually pointing out that this is a completely unrealistic requirement that won't lead to minor successfully being granted an abortion.",

We've eroded away all facets of civilized life in pursuit of pleasure. We've separated food as subsistence now as something we worship on television and continue to try to make more and more opulent. As a result, we're getting fatter and fatter.\n\nWe're suggesting to smash the nuclear family and traditionalism because it stands in the way of progress and is riddled with isms that are Very BadTM. As a result the only people we revere are people on TV that say things we like, and castigate people who dare to think different, including our own families. And before we use red herrings, I'm aware that some families can be awful and traumatic but I sincerely doubt there is an epidemic of godawful families. As a result of this self-centrism, we've hollowed ourselves out of any sense of loyalty aside the people that make us feel good.\n\nWhere we were once modest and altruistic, we're now vain and self-centered. We have entire websites where people can show off how they look (with filters, mind you), at their best, while people's own self worth withers away seeing these photos.\n\nWe've replaced relationships with casual sex. Now you can fuck who you want, when you want, how you want, and cater to all sorts of fetishes and relationship arrangements that Feel Good. Super. Now we have an epidemic of men and women in their 30s who are tragically alone and struggling to find a sense of purpose and relevance. We belong only to ourselves and many of us hate ourselves so it's making us more and more depressed as a society.\n\nI can wax poetic for as long as you like, and I put a lot of heart into my worry for society behind the little snippy comments I make, but to answer your question: Someone terminating an unwanted pregnancy is just an affirmation that things that were once considered sacred: life, a woman's ability to create it, the propagation of our species, is now an inconvenience that we can stick a vacuum to and suck this inconvenience out of us. We use terms like 'parasite' and 'clump of cells' to obfuscate the reality that we're terminating a life because we prioritize orgasms.\n\nQuite the opposite. Women are beautiful, powerful creatures that deserve the respect and adulation they have earned for being able to do such great things with the very bodies they seek to preserve. But with that same preservation comes outcomes, that we can't speak black-and-whitely about. It's a complicated issue and worthy of more than sound bites and dishonest rhetoric. Hope that helps.",

When we started realizing that we can do whatever we want, it was empowering for us, but at the cost of the \"traditional\" values of men. Also, abortion is only an issue in America because people are fighting to take that away. Women around the world terminate pregnancies whether legal or illegal. And it's been that way throughout history. We only hear of it now because people are trying to demonize it. \n\nPeople becoming vain and self centered has nothing to do with them not wanting to marry young or have a traditional family. It comes from the prevalence of social media and the need to be seen for some. \n\nThe people I've met that aren't with someone in their 30s are quite happy. And in my opinion, that's a whole lot better than marrying someone just for the sake of being married",

I'd ask those who haven't been relentlessly demoralized, maybe new immigrants, why they came? Maybe some are brainwashed?\n\nWhen speaking about modesty, which was not something I necessary wanted to infer, but sure, modesty is applicable and appropriate to both sexes. For women, to respect the temple that is their body and not free-market it, but for men to treat women appropriate to their greatness and importance to the world. Not as merely an object to fuck and ghost. Protect, provide, support, and believe. Too many men of today are hedonistic manchildren who want to chase the next cool Marvel movie and crack open a cold IPA instead of being a partner worth wanting. I've seen too many of my female peers struggle to find partners because the dating pool is utter shit. But if they want to hook up? They line up. Maybe I'm just a big dumb ape here, but how is that empowering?\n\nAbortion is far more restrictive in Europe as an example. And if others are doing it, doesn't necessarily move the needle towards it being objectively good. Warriors in the mid 2nd millenia would rape and pillage conquered territory. So many of them did it. Didn't make it objectively correct.\n\nAgain, my point is not that vanity and self-centrism or self-loathing has anything to do with traditional mores, we're just spiritually sick.\n\nThe ones I've met are miserable, and you can see it in their cold dead eyes. We're young and fun now, but today's empowered woman can be tomorrow's spinster. We can do better as a society than debate abortion with absolutes.\n\nPeople are demonizing it because it is demonic.

If any harm follows, then you shall give   \nlife for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for   \nfoot, burn for burn, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.\u201d  \nThis is fascinating because it outlines specific punishments for   \nspecific crimes. If a woman is hurt in a struggle and then has a   \nmiscarriage, the penalty is a fine, a mere financial payment.

In   \nother words, the life and well-being of the woman, the mother, is of   \nmuch greater significance than those of her unborn child.\"  \n\n\nWhat about the fragment where litelary womans life is put above the fetus? It litelary doesn't take fetus as a life either as it doesn't demand a life for a life only if woman dies.\n\nA religious person advocating for laws based off of their beliefs, which are based off of \"Holy Books\" using science as evidence only after they are proven their book doesn't say the same they do is ultimately ironic at best.",

It will deplete all the ressources of a mother if there\u2019s not enough to go around. It will kill the mother if it has to.\n\nPregnancy takes a huge toll on the body, changes that don\u2019t always resolve themselves after pregnancy. The life of the mother is *literally* at risk during pregnancy. Many will also have to go off medication to be pregnant. \n\nYou seem to have a very rose-colored idea of what pregnancy can be. You also seem incapable of putting yourself in others shoes. Not everybody wants children to begin with, others want to be parents but do not want to risk pregnancy for various reasons. \n\nPreviously, when I mentioned bodily autonomy, you responded wit \u201cwhat about the baby\u2019s bodily autonomy?\u201d. Sadly, I feel like you may only believe in bodily autonomy when it suits you. You don\u2019t support contraception and you don\u2019t support abortion, you also don\u2019t understand why people would have sex if they don\u2019t want children. Do I need to point out that you don\u2019t seem to support bodily autonomy for *women*? It seems to me like what you support is controlling women to make sure they behave according to *your* set of beliefs. \n\nI\u2019d also point out that the death toll in war isn\u2019t only due to self-defense. It\u2019s not like the military is known to never attack or as if collateral damage wasn\u2019t a thing. It\u2019s also not like the motives invoked for war are always\u2026 pure and well-intentioned. Why are you not demanding that military personnel who have taken a life while not acting in self-defense be tried for murder?",

There have always been abortions and there will always be abortions. The only thing it\u2019ll change is that, on top of maternal deaths, we\u2019ll have women dying from back alley abortions. We\u2019ll also have women being investigated for miscarriages and women dying because they couldn\u2019t get a D&C after an incomplete miscarriage.\n\nEdit: Do men have to physically suffer the consequences of having sex?",

I think that points more to idiosyncratic cultural beliefs than some kind of universal moral position on abortions.",

Complications that will kill them if the fetus is not removed.\n\n Then followed by the group the pro-life group are always banging on about. Yet the first three majority groups of use cases don't enter the mainstream discussion. These should be at the heart of the bills and laws when taking things into account. Saying \"Then just don't have sex\" is only addressing the tiniest fraction of the full discussion.",

The choice is being placed in the hands of judges who know nothing about medicine. If you are going to outlaw something you need provisions. If a woman would die as a result, and a medical professional deems it necessary to save her life, then you need provision to allow that.\n\nLets take murder. Killing another human being is obviously wrong and whoever does it does need to be punished. However what if it's accidental? A person jumps in front of your car.

Please note this applies to over 90% of abortions. The rules should be written for the majority, and the exceptions to the rules should be written for the minority. I understand you have to factor in rape cases, medical issues, etc.  But those are the minority by a long shot. Legislation should accommodate them but not be dictated by them. \n\nhttp://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/abreasons.html\n\n>and \u201cwhy do non criminal need ghost guns\u201d\n\nNot sure what this has to do with abortion but I\u2019ll answer anyway. \n\nNo one \u201cneeds\u201d them. No one \u201cneeds\u201d the second amendment either per say. Just like no one \u201cneeds\u201d the freedom of speech or any other freedom. But we all have them and they have their purpose whether you agree with it or not. You and I have the right to say whatever we want until it infringes on someone else\u2019s rights. \n\nSame with the second. We have the right to bear arms until those arms are used to take away the rights of others. \n\nBut we do not take away rights from people who *haven\u2019t* abused these. We don\u2019t ban everyone from speaking just because one of them invites violence. You can\u2019t ban everyone from owning firearms just because a few people abuse it. That doesn\u2019t make sense. You have to find a way to fix the issues without infringing on rights. That part is mandatory.",

You refused to explain why it's a problem for a man not to have a choice, but it's fine if a woman doesn't. \n\nThen you went to \"it's fine to abort if she used protection\" but threw your hands up when asked how one proves that.\n\nThen said you're just \"offering solutions\", but now saying \"I don't know what to do\", so several times over you've not offered a solution at all while claiming you are\n\nThen you said you don't care if it's abortion or a baby, she just needs consequences. But again, you earlier said she shouldn't get to abort.\n\nDo you even understand your own argument? I tried and it's just too full of contradiction",

The same states that have shit sex education also have higher rates of teen pregnancy. It's very hard to grasp your opinion because often times teenagers (especially girls) are pressured into sex, do not have access to birth control without parental consent, do not fully understand how pregnancy comes to be (in terms of the fact that precum can get you pregnant), are afraid of the stigma around buying condoms, etc.\n\nGiving teenagers proper sex education would solve a lot of unwanted pregnancy/abortion issues. Knowing all the facts about sex can help teenagers take precautions with sex or even deter them from having it in the first place, like with myself. \n\nThe problem isn't sex or teenagers doing \"dumb things\", it's the lack of education around sex. Let's be honest. Most teens are going to experiment regardless of a proper education in the matter. It's important that they understand how it works and what their options for safe sex/contraception are.",

Not sure why it's magically different when it's you just cause you have a cock.\n\n>then I'm sorry but I can't have that kid with you.\n\nHow about we let a judge decide? If he says you have to bank roll and raise the kid, you do. Plain and simple. Are you fine with having your right to choose taken like that? You said in another comment it upsets you men don't get to make the call, so why are you arguing women shouldn't get to either instead of it being a choice between the two parents?\n\n>we probably were taught differently\n\nYeah, I was taught women are just as much human beings as men. You've clearly been taught men aren't responsible for their actions and women are dumb and deserve punishment if they have sex with you, even if you knowingly lied to them about having a condom per your prior example. But you? Nah you're a man, it can't be equally your fault. You didn't do anything wrong, all you did was have sex with her. She's the one who did wrong, she had sex with you!!",

What I said in that point is that, if protection fails and the girl wants to keep it but I don't want to be the parent (since that's why I used protection), why would I have to be?\n3. Trust me, I know well how child support works. My ma' had it over me because my dad divorced her when I was one. I know all of how it works, even to the obscure detail that not many people know that, in the case that an overage girl rapes an underaged guy and wants to keep the baby, the guy must pay child support. So don't try to come at me with those arguments because I know how it goes.\n4.

Most humans aren't as sex-crazed as they are in American society, and being human is not an excuse to abuse sex. Just because it feels good, it does not mean it should be always done. There must always be accountability and its society's role that responsibility is taken up by persons.\n\nYou are also jumping into conclusions. Most abortions are done without medical reason but solely for the reason of convenience. Abortions are done by dismantling the baby's body while in the womb and clinics count their body parts as good practice that none is left in the womb. If their life is not in medical danger, there is no reason to murder a child.",

It\u2019s not a bunch of cells: it\u2019s a human being with his own body, DNA, blood type and heart beat. \n\nIf you say a human is not human until he breaths, that would mean you can abort a baby one second before being born, and fully formed. That\u2019s murder.\n\nAn unborn baby has a nervous system and he can feel too, thus why many reactions to music or other external stimulus in the womb after a few months. \n\nA baby of a few days old hasn\u2019t had any \u201clife experiences\u201d and still would be murder if you kill him. \n\nIf a mother doesn\u2019t want birth control and a condom fails, she needs to be aware of the responsibility of sex: just like any other human activity you need to do it responsibly and it can have consequences. Your sexuality is not a toy because it involves affecting a new life.\n\nWe are not affecting any women\u2019s right: if she doesn\u2019t want to keep the baby she can put him in adoption, just like Steve Jobs. Killing her own baby is not a valid choice. Your life circumstances doesn\u2019t justify killing a innocent human being, no matter what. \n\nYour opinion is irrelevant to facts: it\u2019s not a lump of cells, it\u2019s a human life.\n\nTeenage motherhood can be traumatic and as such we should work on better parenting (taking care of your minors), sex education and access to contraceptives, not on killing babies. If a minor goes and commit a crime he or she would be subject to the consequences too, independently of the age.\n\nThe fact that people will still commit crimes if we don\u2019t legalize them doesn\u2019t validate the crime. People still kill each other everyday even though is illegal and murder is still bad. \n\nIllegal abortions killing a lot of mothers Is false. In countries like Mexico there were less than 40 deaths per year related to illegal abortions. We abort one million babies every year in the US. You have false compassion.\n\nBe responsible. Focus on helping single moms, on promoting adoption, on access to opportunities, education, contraceptives. Not on killing babies.",

Sexuality is a serious act, not a toy. It has consequences: it creates human life, your daughter or son, and you don't have the right to kill her or him.\n\nMy argument hinges on the fact that the unborn is human life. And killing an innocent human life is murder. Killing your own baby is even worse.\n\nThe baby is developing indeed, just as he will continue developing after he is born. He won't even be able to walk or even eat by himself. He will depend on you many years later, and even after that you or anyone else doesn't have the right to kill him. It depends on you because he is your son or daughter.\n\nMany babies cannot feel many experiences yet the following second they are born. Are you ok killing him right after he is out of the womb? That's legal murder. Your argument doesn't sustain itself.\n\nA mother who is not ready to have a kid should be incredibly careful with her sexuality, same as their parents if she is a minor. Killing your own baby to maintain a lifestyle is not a justification especially when that baby is coming from a consented act: sex, in 99% of the cases, making you ethically liable. Sexuality is not a toy. \n\nYou try to present a baby feeling abandoned or having a bad life as something bad and propose to give him death instead as a form of compassion from your side: that's hypocrite and sickening. You should analyze why do you believe what you believe, you might be parroting what you were told to parrot. You don't seem to understand the atrocity of your own thoughts. Wake up.\n\nYou are not tired. You are trying to solve this false dilemma: abortion is a tragedy.\n\nLet's push more education, contraceptives, support for single mothers and responsibility from men with adoption culture from anyone else.",

Science consensus is that human life begins at conception: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3211703\n\nI am glad you consider your thoughts: I used to be pro-abortion like you, until one of my brothers had to take this decision with his girlfriend and it was obvious that not having the baby was going to be murder. The kid is now in kindergarten. I understood I was simply parroting what I was told to parrot in school while not having analyzed the situation properly. \n\nKilling another human being is never a choice. No one interferes with the right of women: they can have sex with as many people and as often as they want, but they should be responsible, both should use contraceptives and still be aware of the possibilities. Making their kid pay their consequences is atrocious. Sex is not a toy, just like many other things in human life.\n\nI am glad you are at least starting to consider lowering that limit, that should save millions of lives, just like Texas did. Let\u2019s start by pushing together that. The nervous system develops in week 3 so both babies in the womb and born feel. Both are human lives and thus murder.\n\nPeople are being indoctrinated while we should be helping with a better education, opportunities for single moms and responsibility.\n\nCheers.",

So I dont think having sex necessarily warrants the responsibilty of having a child when birth control and condoms fail, and in general I dont see how its bad to abort a fetus because I really dont see it  as  a human life yet, human life does begin at conception but I dont think a fetus is fully sapient yet at its first or second trimester at least and if a person wishes to abort during the third,we both agree its due to mostly justified medicle emergencies \n\nI think abortion is really a choice, people can choose to keep the child and carry it to term and people can choose to abort the fetus if they so wish to do so, \n\nanyway this convo is getting LONG and Im sorry if it comes across as rude if me to end it off here?

My argument hinges on the fact that it's human life and the proof is a baby is born if you don't kill that life.\n\nYou mention a possible bad life (not a fact or destiny) as the justification for killing the baby. Presenting death as a form of compassion: you are hypocrite.\n\nA baby at the fetal stage is a human life. The American federal law allows killing a baby up to 28 weeks. A well-formed baby. Texas lowered it to 6 weeks and feminists still protested. You seem to be more on the Texas side. Let's march together to start by lowering the number of weeks. We'd save millions of lives.\n\nAbortion is a tragedy.",
