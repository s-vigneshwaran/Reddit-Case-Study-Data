He climbed onto my shoulder right out of the cage and bunted me right in the ear - that's when I knew he was the one. I fuckin' loved that cat, and that fuckin' cat loved me right back. He would follow me everywhere, sleep on my bed every night, wait outside for me to come home - he'd even jump on the hood of my car and peek inside to see what was taking me so damn long to get out. Oh, and he kept bunting me in the face at every opportunity. He kept doing that until the day I held him in my arms when he was put to sleep. Months prior, I noticed he was limping and the vet said had a failing heart valve, and it slowly got worse until he was suffering and in constant pain. I chose to give him the mercy he deserved for giving me so much unconditional love and companionship. This happened almost three years ago, but still makes me cry when I think about it.",

He had free access to the outdoors via a catdoor and over the course of this year I guess his feline dementia was causing him to become increasingly skittish of me for seemingly no reason, often running to avoid me in the house and acting like I was going to hurt him or something, entirely unlike how he used to be. One day he just stopped bothering to even come back inside, instead spending all of his time on a neighbor's porch for probably a few weeks straight while she would just feed and water him herself since he wouldn't bother coming back inside my place. One day during a rainstorm he came and laid on my lap for an hour while I was sitting on my porch, and after the rain stopped he went off to do his own thing. That was probably the last time I saw him, as not even a week later my neighbor asked if I'd seen him lately.\n\nIn a bit of an odd way I guess I wanted the closure of actually finding him dead whenever that time came, I even knew where I wanted to bury him. But we hardly even got to be friends in the last several months of him being alive, and then he just went off and died somewhere. That one rainy day was the closest I had to a last goodbye and it didn't even feel much like one. It sucks.",
