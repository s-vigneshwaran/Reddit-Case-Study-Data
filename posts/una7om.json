Like, forget science.. just keeping up with everything every other human is doing would be impossible.  So if he's afraid Iwe're capable of being equal to God, then it begs the question \"is God actually even capable any of these things\"?\n\nSecond, why would an all powerful God be fearful of humans or any other creature?  He's, all powerful right?  Could just zap us out of existence.\n\nThird, this just sounds cruel.  In human terms isn't this much like a pro-NFL player kneecapping his kid so he would grow up to be a better player than his Dad was?  \n\nI mean, I realize this is r/atheism so the point is somewhat allegorical & besides the point.  Just saying idiosyncrasies like this point less towards the widely accepted Christian interpretation of God, & more towards an ancient alien civilization style of God.  \n\nEg : another good question.  Why would God, Jesus, or angels need to go up & down from the sky?  Couldn't they just pull a Dr Who & zap in & out of the physical plane?  \n\nObviously spent way too much time thinking about this stuff in my youth.

God doesn't want to hear that you can recite memorized prayers. Leave it to God to judge other people. It's not your business to judge them and you will not be forgiven if you do. So sayeth the Lord.\n\nOr even more condensed: Keep your religion to yourself and keep your nose out of other people's affairs.  \n\nMatthew 6:5-8\n\n[5] \u201cAnd when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. [6] But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. [7] And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words. [8] Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.\n\nMatthew 6:14-5\n\n[14] For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. [15] But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.",

What became the Catholic church ended up deciding that they can throw out the ceremonial and judicial law, and for moral law, many churches now just consider the 10 commandments.\n\nBut boy is there weirdness baked into how they worked this stuff out, there was lots of backstabbing involved, language barriers, excommunications declarations of heresy, and schisms. Resulting in those congregations who insisted on keeping the laws of the old testament as \"Jewish Christian\" sects. And everyone else got to move on to squabble about things like whether or not Jesus was literally God.\n\nMany of these Jewish Christian sects died out, allowing Catholic and Orthodox churches to take over. It's argued and there may be some truth to the notion that it was easier for these churches to spread because new converts were not required by the covenant of Abraham to undergo circumcision.",

Mosaic law says that anyone who says that they\u2019re a prophet will be proven to be\u2026if they say it and it\u2019s true, they\u2019re a prophet. If they say something and it doesn\u2019t happen, they\u2019re not speaking divine words.

Partly because the only salt I knew was table salt, but it just seemed like an odd choice. I mean, could have done anything, but chose a salt pillar.\n\nOn that note, a paper was published (late last year iirc) that detailed how a likely meteor exploded in/over the middle east thousands of years ago. (Think Tunguska explosion) They found evidence of buildings that were sheared off at angles, evidence of extremely high temperatures that wouldn't have been possible for man to have done, as well as deposits of tons of salt. They also documented a few different sites of cities that were destroyed and/or abandoned, and acknowledged that people would connect them to S&G, as well as Jericho, but refused to speculate further. \n\nIt's my opinion, that this event was the source material for what was written in the OT, but that it was handed down for 100s of years or more in an oral fashion, before finally being written down. I think that, given the circumstances, there are two likely theories. First, the whole story of Lot was merely invented around the event. Second, there was some truth to the story, but what actually happened was that a large chunk of salt fell on someone and it became \"turned into\".\n\n\nEdit: Basic reference link https://www.sc.edu/uofsc/posts/2021/09/09_conversation_explosion.php#.Ynw-OGkpA0E",

I work with some very devout Christians that are all about the peace, love, giving, and good works aspects of the religion. They all believe in the validity of, (and even practice) science and the scientific method. They believe in God and the divinity of Jesus, but they don't inject it into their everyday lives because that's just literally not practical.\n\nIt's just as easy to construct strawman Christians as they construct strawman atheists, but there's so much more nuance in this world to everything.\n\nCritically thinking people can still believe in God. Very intelligent people can still believe in God. It's good on him to point out the hypocrisy and authoritarian rot that these people are subjecting their minds to.",

But yes, the Abrahamic God is very obviously  petty, jealous, and evil. But religious people aren't crazy, and it's not good, nor helpful to frame them that way. They're normal people just like you and me. They have **learned** to believe in the magic sky wizard and his illegitimate starchild young in life, and it's very hard to break that.\n\n> Unless they are at the christian buffet, and pick and choose, and if so, then they are just phonies. \n\nYou can still believe in something even if you don't adhere to every last word of it. There are people that play games casually as their main form of entertainment. Just because they aren't at the highest level of competition in those games doesn't mean they aren't gamers. Gatekeeping what is and isn't a Christian is an exercise in futility. There are at least as many interpretations of Christianity as there are Christians.\n\n>if one believes without evidence, well...u sure they are intelligent?\n\nYes. Because intelligence is a measure of your ability to recognize patterns and draw inference from those patterns. Arguably, the ability to draw logical inference from minimal evidence is one of the highest markers of intelligence there is.\n\nMost of Christianity hangs on anecdotal experience and indoctrination. Some of the smartest people who have ever lived have been Christians.\n\nAttempting to draw a connection between intelligence and religious belief will basically always end up failing.",

Hell, when Jesus used the phrase in Matthew, he was using it as direct reference and summation of the Old Testament.  By no means was this idea created by the new testament.  \n\nFurther - no one needed the bible to tell them \"treat others as you wish to be treated\", this is an axiom as old as time.  This is the same self-important solipsism that allows modern religious types to claim aloud that without religion we would have no moral compass as if we were all murdering and raping each other with impunity before Christianity hit the world stage.\n\nFeel free to actually read the entire bible some time.  Plenty of us have done exactly that and don't have to validate that fact by claiming adherence to its absurdities  The old testament loves to go into insane territory, fine, but plenty of the new testament is just as moronic and worthy of ridicule.  Jesus spits on a man's face to cure his blindness.  That's just shitty storytelling.  Unless the reader is inclined to mindless credulity, those types of excerpts are just laughably idiotic.  Embodiment of the all powerful deity, has to hock phlegm into a man's face as a \"cure\"... serously that's just such terrible storytelling in other passages he can heal with a simple touch, but this tract was written by a different human who made up his own version of it.  That's why the old testament is a much more worthwhile read.

He was a Roman citizen & a Pharisee just like his father before him.  It is unlikely he would have risen to these positions &/or effectively taken over Christianity if he was psychotic.  \n\nTo my point : until his \"convertion\", Paul mercilessly persecuted & killed Christians.  In fact, he was on the road to Damascus (the Roman capital of that region) to request permission to begin mass arrests when he \"had a vision of Jesus\".  \n\nThis is weird for multiple reasons : \n\n- all sightings of Jesus occurred within ~40 days of the resurrection,  however, Paul claim a sighting ~ 5 years later.\n\n- tho accounts vary, the people he was traveling with seem not to have seen or heard what Paul claimed to witness.\n\n- Paul claimed Jesus used the exact words from a Greek play quoting Dionysus (God of partying) translated into Aramaic. Why would Jesus quote a Greek play or a false God?\n\n- Paul claimed to be blinded during this encounter, yet then was instantly healed by another disciple.  This is medically \"weird\"\n\nNow, assuming zero magic actually happened here?  This was either a complete psychotic break from reality, which entirely changed his life, & which never seems to have reoccured afterwards..  \n\nOr.. Paul was completely full of shit & used the story to infiltrate the early Christian underground, allowing him to radically alter the core messages of Christianity by overlaying Roman values eg \"women should have long hair & men should have short hair\".  Short hair was a Roman virtue for war.  I really doubt God would care.\n\nSo we're left with 3 options: \n\n- Magic happened & it all went down like Paul claimed\n\n- Paul had a single sudden psychotic episode which changed his entire life, despite seemingly never having another before or since.\n\n- Paul was acting as an undercover agent to integrate Christians into the Roman traditions (something Rome was famous for).\n\nIs there some reason you don't think Rome used undercover agents?",

One that you raised as to how Aramaic translates to English, as far as words having synonyms or contextual meaning.  A second often overlooked issue is cultural-shift in meanings.  Like how the words \"dude, hot, cool, etc\" in English have changed meanings over a relatively short time frame.  Taken out of the cultural context from 2000 years ago, a lot of words, prose, jokes, political references, etc are often missed entirely which can drastically change the interpretation.",

From the language used to the disruptive gaps between books, there are much \u201ceasier\u201d paths to reading all 66 books without having to start with Genesis and finish with Revalations.\n\nMost of the reading plans out there do suggest you start with New Testament to get a better \u201cfeel\u201d for the era and the language\u2026and then kinda bounce between Old/New until you\u2019re done.  If you truly want to make it through all of it, I suggest you look those plans up.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that some books are stories while others are parables and others are simply written hymns/poetry/prose.  That contributes to confusion, but along with the \u201creading plans\u201d that you find out there\u2026a few of them come with \u201chistorical context\u201d side-pieces that explains a bit of the chronology and the reasons behind their inclusion into the official 66 books.  Using those guides can get you through probably 60-70% of the interesting stuff\u2026but that last 30-40% is mentally and physically draining.  It\u2019s like a marathon where the last 1/3rd of the race is trying to army crawl through quicksand\u2026but you have a better chance of completing the task by leaning into the \u201csunken cost\u201d fallacy.

Those that do\u2026they leave the church after enough time, and only if their own accord.  Full stop.\n\nCan confirm. I was a Christian who really knew nothing about Christianity, even though I did go to church, and I did defend it vehemently when arguing against \"moralless atheists\". I believed all of it simply because it was hammered into my identity.\n\nThen, around 16, I became super depressed, cynical, and suicidal. I would ask god, \"Why do this to me?\". \n\nSo I started to read. I needed to find AN answer, and I did. Reading the bible is what caused me to slowly come to the realization that it's all chance, or determinism. Nothing truly matters, and the Universe serves no purpose. No great being gives a fuck, and it's all bullshit. The Bible doesn't hold up in modern day at all, and certainly not as a fount of morals. It's inherently hypocritical, and self-defeating.\n\nI later started identifying as agnostic because I still wanted \"plausible deniability\" when confronting god (another christian tactic), even though it supposedly \"knows all\".\n\nOver years I eased into where I am now, which is a full on atheist that sees religion for what it is: A tool to control via promise of reward, and threat of eternal torture.\n\nI'm happier now without the burden of false judgement, and predestined torture, weighing me down. Knowing that the only true love, and compassion, is that which we give each other, and that we do it because we need/want to, is comforting. There is no driver for that universal empathy, and compassion, besides us. I guess the fact that there was ***never*** some entity tormenting me due to it's own ego being bruised was my answer.\n\nThe day that parents stop perpetuating this mind killing cult ideology is the day I'll actually regain hope in humanity. Though I know I won't see it.",

Guess what, there is absolutely no record of any saint with that name. Ever. But try to bring it up to grandma and she'll refuse to hear it.\n\nOn an another occasion, she asked me what was the origin of my bestfriend's name (Lilith). So i spoke about the myth behind it, which, my bad, should have remembered how blasphemous it is, oops. She did not like it. So i got my phone out to look up some more infos about the origin and stuff.

Your job as a Christian is to take care of their earthly needs while they are on earth, nothing more.\n\nIf you're confused about how to behave as a Christian, ask yourself \"what would Mr. Rogers do?\"",

They simply take the cliff notes their pastor gives them, which in most cases the pastors will take a couple of verses and read those, and those alone and write an entire sermon based on their skewed ideology and using those verses. Often times if you take the verses the pastor used and read a few verses before or after you see the entire passage meant something entirely different. \n\nAtheist will actually read the Bible and see what it says in it's entirety, which is why it's easy to disect and refute the ignorant and half-informed views of most who use the Bible in their arguments. Also, once they realize you actually know the Bible, and to a far greater extent than them, they will respond with some insult or the ever loved get out of jail free card, \"well that's between be and the Lord, you can't judge me\"... All while they are busy judging others as if they were hired by Jesus himself.",

So they ditch the garbage and keep the good stuff. Not out of ignorance, or confirmation bias, but because it aligns with current moral best practices.  You will see this in \"liberal\" Catholic communities sometimes, some Lutherans, some Methodists, some Anglicans  many Reform Jews, some Buddhists, some Hindus, Unitarians and probably other sects - they are all for putting an end to fundamentalist bigotry and are embracing of LGBQT*, pro-choice, civil rights, reform, progressive beliefs, and updating of the tenants of the organization to better serve society and its members.  MLK was a pastor as well as  civil rights leader.\n\nI would personally argue they could do all that *without* the need for a religious organization, and do a better job, but \"religion\" is a really powerful organizing force that *can* be used for good... it's just a really really dangerous weapon (especially \"Revealed Truth\" versions like stuff out of Abrahamic traditions) because it is so easy to slip in to the trap that it tells you you are *RIGHT* and that anyone who disagrees with you is Evil.",

People have been victim-blaming rape victims since ancient times.\n\n\u201c23. If a man happens to meet in a town a virgin pledged to be married and he sleeps with her,\n24. you shall take both of them to the gate of that town and stone them to death\u2014the young woman because she was in a town and did not scream for help, and the man because he violated another man's wife. You must purge the evil from among you.\n25. But if out in the country a man happens to meet a young woman pledged to be married and rapes her, only the man who has done this shall die.\n26. Do nothing to the woman; she has committed no sin deserving death.\u201d\n\nDeuteronomy 22:22\u201326",

How does it make sense that the procedure is specifically designed to induce abortion if literally nothing happens unless the woman has committed adultery?\n\nPlus, as everyone all the way back to Constantine would attest, there is no objectively right interpretation for a text whose authors are so long dead and buried. For the people who wrote it, and the vast majority of the people who follow religions based on it, their interpretations do not consider it justifying of elective abortions, and obviously abortion is specifically condemned in the New Testament so I really don\u2019t see where there is room for honest uncertainty, just people shoehorning their politics into a religious text.\n\nWhich, again, is not only dishonest, but needless. It is patently unconstitutional for this debate to come anywhere near US legislation.",

If you really care about the abortion issue stuff like this isn't going to help anybody except make you feel better maybe and if you put yourself feeling better above the issue than you really don't care that much",

Why would he propagate the faith of baby butchers? \n\nSo he starts with Number 5:11, which I think is the best comparison. It is an abortion, it\u2019s basically when a man suspects his pregnant wife cheated on him. He goes to a priest and they give her a concoction where, if it is his child, she comes out okay but, if she gets a miscarriage out of it, she cheated on him. Real witch trial \u201cif she sinks she wasn\u2019t a witch\u201d kind of stuff. However, this isn\u2019t pro choice. This is more a test of adultery and very patriarchal. It\u2019s not quite an endorsement of abortion as a means for a woman to control her life, it\u2019s more another tool the husband has to control his wife and keep her in line. \n\nThe rest I don\u2019t think are too relevant. They\u2019re taking about murdering babies of an opposing nation, yes it\u2019s awful and gruesome, but it\u2019s not an endorsement of just murdering babies in general. If an Israelite kills an enemy soldier, that doesn\u2019t mean the Bible endorses killing for fun. All it\u2019s really saying is that the Bible isn\u2019t a beacon of morality and endorses a lot of evil acts, so a mother killing her child isn\u2019t relevant. It\u2019s NOT arguing that a fetus isn\u2019t a person and that it shouldn\u2019t be used to dictate a woman\u2019s health and life. \n\nWhich, okay, those are reasonable beliefs about the Bible, but it\u2019s coming from a Pastor so it\u2019s a bit odd. It\u2019s not \u201cmy religion is about love and it endorses a woman\u2019s right to choose\u201d, it\u2019s more \u201cmy religion is evil and can\u2019t be used to judge morality\u201d, okay so why are you a pastor for said religion?",

Since it isn't, the most reasonable interpretation is \"just before birth.\"\n\nIn other words, that mass of cells is just a fetus until just before it is born -- *in your god's eyes.* We've actually done better than that, and moved the abortion cutoff to about 24 weeks after gestation.\n\nSee, either the bible is accurate or it is allegorical. If it is accurate, then you must treat it as you would a contract. Exact definitions matter. If it is allegorical, then you are free to interpret it any way you want, *but your interpretation is no better than mine.*",

          "text": "> Proverbs 24: 11- 12\n\nSeeing as the Bible states an infant doesn\u2019t have a soul until god gives the breath of life, I don\u2019t see how this verse destroys anything about abortions.\n\nProverbs 31:8\n\nCan\u2019t be a person or a \u201cwho\u201d without a soul.  So doesn\u2019t effect abortion. Biblically of course.\n\nExodus 20:13\n\nReally?  God routinely tells his followers to do some killing.  Seems like the whole no soul thing makes killing fetuses even easier then all the born adults and babies god said to kill.\n\nExodus 23:7\n\nWith original sin, who\u2019s innocent?  We are biblically born worthy of hell after all....\n\nGenesis 9:6\n\nUnless god says it\u2019s okay to shed the blood, hey, isn\u2019t there a verse about kosher abortion in the Bible?\n\nIsaiah 49:1-5\n\nWeird how all the other people god formed in the womb are okay to kill.  \n\nLuke 1:15\n\nSo god is speaking about ONE person.  Now that\u2019s what I call arguing from the VERY specific.  Guess we can\u2019t abort that guy.  Oh wait.  If he father thought his mother had whored around there was a biblical test/abortion method.  \n\nJeremiah 1:5\n\nSounds like a very specific person again....\n\nThe only thing you destroyed here is the idea the Bible is without contradictions.",
