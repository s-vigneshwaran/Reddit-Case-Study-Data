Embarrassingly I suffer some complications and the mandates in our country are making it harder for one to get a job, I'm the unfortunate ones that can't get a vaccine due to past bad adverse reactions to other vaccines. I even have to be careful with my diet. My partner is very happy for me to stay home and do all the chores around the house. \n\nLuckily, I'm very creative, so we're starting a small business on the side where I can sell art. I'm very good with money and financial decisions, even my partner thinks I'm too good. Most of his debts are paid off from a previous ex partner years ago with my help. He appreciates having me home and doing all the cooking. I think if you're financially stable and you have a good lady that looks after your home, doesn't spend your money, uses you, controls you and doesn't be unfaithful. Than a traditional relationship can work in someone's favor. Again, it really depends on the situation. \n\nCost of living is becoming harder, that's why we must make sacrifices, its difficult enough as it is. I'm a good person and I've always worked when in relationships and I've always provided as much as my SO, but I never got the same respect and appreciation in return unlike with my partner now. I get appreciation for making him lunch and dinner, its honestly rewarding. It's not for all women, as I understand alot of women want to work and feel equal to men or higher up than men. \n\nEveryone should have the right to do what they want to do, even every man has the right to what they want in a woman. It's only one woman out of billions that will accept him. Why should that matter to anyone else? It's a man and woman's right to choose their lifestyle. This comment is not just for one person, but for all to understand. Even my relationship is no one else's business. We're happy.",
