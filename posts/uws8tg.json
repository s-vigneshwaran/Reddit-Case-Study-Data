I was 19 at the time, so I asked if it looked like I had had a stroke recently or was 70 years old. After about a month it was reported to the credit bureaus and tanked my credit score. Finally ended up getting a lawyer and going to court, took 6 years and the settlement was barely enough to cover my legal fees.\n\n![gif](giphy|65kQC6Mg4XIsw)",

That\u2019s fucking stupid and also, illegal because you can\u2019t hold a third party, unrelated to an incident, liable for payment. \nMaybe if I was that dude\u2019s family, but I didn\u2019t even know the guy. We just had the same name.\nBut yeah, eventually and painfully, it was resolved but my shiny, new credit took a nosedive I finally just got it back up (at 36) to around a 700, lowest it got was 410. Because Equifax don\u2019t give a fuck if a debt was fraudulent, your ass is gonna suffer.\nAnd the payoff from the court, like I said, barely covered legal fees after my lawyer paid all the filing costs, etc. and took his 30% cut. \nAll in all I was left with a shit credit score and like $2500.",

Well, during one of their calls, they called the wrong number and disclosed ALL his account information to someone else which is a huge hippa violation. Once he called them out on it and told them he was contacting his attorney, they *then* decided to send the bill to collections. It\u2019s completely fucked his credit. We couldn\u2019t even get an in store credit card for cheap furniture. They attorney is currently working on it but these people are so scuzzy and pathetic that they will not budge.

As in, they need to have a list of prices for common procedures available so the customer can shop around, since an x-ray can be 180$ at one hospital and 1,800$ at another down the street. The only problem with it is that the fine is 300$ a day, and it isn't applicable to all hospitals apparently. With some tweaking though, like making the penalty much harsher, it could eventually be a big step in the right direction. If the differences in prices between local hospital A, B, C and D were available on like, a free app, people would stop getting procedures done at the expensive places, and eventually the hospitals would have to make their procedures cost the same, and it would be the price that the person doing it cheapest was doing it at. If the fine was more like, I dunno, no fine but instead three months to comply or you get shut the fuck down, it would work.  \n\n\n[https://www.managedhealthcareexecutive.com/view/ready-or-not-the-new-year-brings-trump-s-price-transparency-rule](https://www.managedhealthcareexecutive.com/view/ready-or-not-the-new-year-brings-trump-s-price-transparency-rule)",

For sure their would be groups of people saying \"Wait, 2,600$? You guys do know that the one downtown is half that right?\", which they actually don't know. If you lose all the x-rays because the guy downtown takes them all, you have to be competitive or just lose the money.  \n\n\nAlso, lets be real 99% of the people going to the hospital are doing so on non-emergencies. Sure the guy who just got shot doesn't have time to shop around, but all the diabetes check-ups and x-rays and physical therapy sessions absolutely need to start to cost at least a little bit close to the same from place to place. Again a ten dollar difference in price is one thing but it can be a hundred thousand dollar difference! That's just insanity!

Add in another layer of financial differences and it'll be a deeper shit show.  53 year old fat Mike is going to belligerently demand a cheaper hospital while having a heart attack and literally not understanding that particular hospital doesn't have a Cath Lab that will save his life.\n\nLet's just make universal healthcare a human right already and remove this financially crippling BS like every other civilized country.

I didn\u2019t even know for sure that it was broken so opted to go to a clinic just down the street and pay $95. Got the X-ray: it confirmed that the foot was broken. Then I set up an appointment with a doctor through my insurance but\u2026 they can\u2019t use that X-ray! You could see that my foot was very clearly broken in the X-ray\u2014 it wasn\u2019t a hairline fracture\u2014 but they insisted that they would need to take new X-rays both for liability reasons and to make sure nothing was missed. So unless your insurance covers care at a range of places you won\u2019t really be able to choose between them. \n\nSecond story: in the early years of Obamacare you could not get the same plan year after year. They would change the plan slightly, rename it, and because the plan you\u2019d had was no longer available you\u2019d have to find new coverage. This was to get around the part of the law that limited year over year price increases for any particular plan. Oh that plan? We don\u2019t have it anymore. But we do have this one with a slightly different coverage for $300 more per month.",

If they knew that every single appointment could cost them more than they were billing you they would have you sign off on every procedure in advance with the prices shown up front. Maybe also they have to show you prices for the same procedures for their five closest competitors. I still think they\u2019d get around it though\u2014 probably collude to have different prices but balance out overall. Your X-ray might be cheaper here but the cast will cost more\u2026 that sort of thing.

No one can do anything about it. Want cheaper steak? Go somewhere else.\n\nThat said, insurers and providers negotiate rates in advance. Your insurers know ***EXACTLY*** what they are willing to pay for X procedure or billing code. However, the negotiated rates are different for each insurer...which is why the front desk staff often don't know what you're going to get charged.\n\nIf you want to know what a Dr. Appointment is going to cost, ask the staff what the cash rate for service will be. Then call your insurer and ask how much they will reimburse for X service. Chances are, the cash rate is lower, because cash on the barrelhead TALKS and medical providers hate dealing with insurance companies as much as you do.\n\nMedical insurance is the biggest scam on the planet. We all need regular medical maintenance....just as cars need regular oil changes and new tires. Do you carry oil and tire insurance or do you just pay it as needed?\n\nThat said....Orange Man Bad...but the TFG administration passed a rule establishing exactly the price transparency you lament for not existing: https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/trump-administration-announces-historic-price-transparency-requirements-increase-competition-and",

In America there isn't an overall \"standardized\" pricing for hospitals/medical nationwide and each provider can set whatever prices they desire. However, insurance companies do have max limits on what they deem \"appropriate\" pricing for services, procedures, supplies, etc. You will notice on your bill after insurance, what the hospital initially charged, something like an adjusted \"allowed\" charge, then what you owe after insurance covered their part. The problem is, insurance as a business, also wants to make money and recoup costs and you'll still sometimes get charged more than you really should for certain things.",

Also like 95% of your bill goes to the hospital, not the doctor, to cover all those salaries and overhead. As an engineer I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard the story about Henry Ford and Charles Steinmetz:\n\n>Ford, whose electrical engineers couldn\u2019t solve some problems they were having with a gigantic generator, called Steinmetz in to the plant. Upon arriving, Steinmetz rejected all assistance and asked only for a notebook, pencil and cot. According to Scott, Steinmetz listened to the generator and scribbled computations on the notepad for two straight days and nights. On the second night, he asked for a ladder, climbed up the generator and made a chalk mark on its side. Then he told Ford\u2019s skeptical engineers to remove a plate at the mark and replace sixteen windings from the field coil. They did, and the generator performed to perfection.\n\n>Henry Ford was thrilled until he got an invoice from General Electric in the amount of $10,000. Ford acknowledged Steinmetz\u2019s success but balked at the figure. He asked for an itemized bill.\n\n>Steinmetz, Scott wrote, responded personally to Ford\u2019s request with the following:\n\n>Making chalk mark on generator $1.\n\n>Knowing where to make mark $9,999.\n\n>Ford paid the bill.\n\nThis is why it wasn\u2019t just a Claritin.",

There\u2019s a reason it takes time to build a bridge.\n\nAgain, the cost of the \u201cextras\u201d that go into maintaining doctors salary, hospital equipment, etc, is moot because my bill was reduced when I asked for it to be itemized.  This would mean that the hospital was overcharging me because they felt like it, not because that was the actual cost of labor and overhead. They could not justify my bill on paper.\n\nIf GE can justify their $10,000 bill, which is something engineers do constantly, then they deserve their $10,000. (Interesting story though, I actually hadn\u2019t heard of that one).\n\nI pay high premiums for good insurance so that they can cover the cost of hospital maintenance, doctor salary and whatever else my medical bills go to.  So yes, I agree with you, I\u2019m not paying $400 for a Claritin, it was an exaggeration, but I shouldn\u2019t have been paying $400  for their services in the first place\u2014and that is according to the hospital themselves since they reduced my bills. My insurance already paid them those costs to cover salary, etc. I don\u2019t think my doctors are predatory, but the people who run the hospitals are definitely just trying to make a buck off of people who won\u2019t question.

With the absolute sole exception of hospitals offered to veterans, there is no concept of government-provided services. There are some government-affiliated health plans, but they're not widely available to adults of working age. They're private companies doing private company things.\n\nSometimes it's easier to just avoid the hospital because it's not like there's a menu of services you order from with their prices listed clearly beside. You walk in and just kinda hope you don't get blindsided. I've had a high-deductible plan for years now (basically, I pay hospital/clinic rates unless something major happens, at which point I actually get very good, low-cost coverage), and even though I've paid for a fairly wide range of things, I'm still completely unable to predict what's going to send my costs through the roof. For example, I had an ultrasound done of my heart not terribly long ago. I figured it would cost about the same as a fetal ultrasound. They had some trouble seeing one of the walls of my heart, so they gave me some contrast thing they basically described as blood-safe fatty foam. Once I got the bill, I saw that the ultrasound itself was pretty close to what we paid for an ultrasound during pregnancy, but the contrast cost almost double the actual ultrasound, and then I was firmly in the thousands of dollars instead of hundreds. If I'd actually known that, I probably would have said \"do what you can with what you see,\" but I doubt anyone in the room actually knew the costs, so it's not like they were being sketchy about it.",

Basically no one on the floor knows what rates have been negotiated with your insurance company. The right people to call for a co-insurance situation is your insurance.\n\nDoesn't really help if you don't know what's wrong in advance or unexpected complications arise, though. There are still plenty of ways to get blindsided.\n\n>some hospitals don't itemize the bill so it's harder to dispute costs.\n\nWhile I can't say for certain this is *illegal* (I suspect it is, though), I can say for certain that this would get your claim tossed in any fee-for-service model, so rest assured that the hospitals both can and will itemize anything.\n\nThere's enough bullshit in healthcare billing without us having to make new things up.",

You pay cash for the doctor who\u2019s out of network because your insurance company made an administrative decision to only work with specific doctors and pass off all the overhead directly to the consumer.

If you have insurance backed by a\u2026 \u201creputable\u201d company, ambulance may be out of network, but emergency ambulance gets covered at the in network rate.  20+ years ago, the insurance would just use billed charges as the allowed amount, and if they didn\u2019t, you could probably get it fixed with 1 phone call.  The same would be done for all out of network providers in an emergency, up to and including the big ass facility bill.  You might have to pay your deductible, but at least everything you paid would credit toward your deductible and out of pocket for the year.\n\nToday, those provisions to process emergency charges at the in network level are still there, but insurance companies try to use 3rd parties to negotiate the allowable rates down.  Sometimes those 3rd parties are good at it and the patient doesn\u2019t get extra bills, sometimes they aren\u2019t.  It might take 3 or 4 calls to get it fixed now.  One or two to insurance and a couple with the negotiator. \n\nLast year, the government did something at least mildly useful and passed federal surprise billing laws that went into effect on 1/1/22.  It made it so for at least some bills, the out of network providers can\u2019t bill the patient more than the initial copay/deductible/coinsurance that was determined on the initial processing.  They gotta take that up with the insurance, and if the allowable does go up, the insurance pays that difference, not the patient.",

They're betting that the average person will spend less money than they pay and they're tweaking the game payouts to ensure that profit margin. \n\nThe only way you can \"win\" as the customer is to get insurance to pay out more than you paid them, but that's only likely if you get seriously sick. Your goal is to actually lose the wager, and pay out more money than you spend, because that means you didn't get sick. (or you died young or whatever)\n\nThe insurance company knows that they have to pay out on the rare sickness-bets they lose, because that's the only reason that people will buy insurance. Casinos do the same big payouts because that's the only way people will come to the casino. \n\nEven with or without the insurance mandate, you *have to* have insurance or you will be financially ruined if you get seriously sick. Alternatively you would just die, which is rather not in your best interests, even if you are saving money by not having insurance.\n\nHealth insurance is basically coerced participation in a rigged game. It's not exactly a scam, but it's not exactly *not* a scam either.",

Switch to private insurance. 9 months go by. I get a bill from the hospital for my son being born. Weird. I had insurance. So I call them and they tell me I never registered my son with Tricare. Ok well no one ever told me that\u2019s how that worked so let\u2019s get him registered. Oh sorry you fucked yourself, no insurance for you because you didn\u2019t tell your insurance company you wanted him insured. \n\nWell no fucking shit I want my newbies son to have the save medical coverage I have. Why wouldn\u2019t he? Why wouldn\u2019t I be able to tell the insurance company when he was born and they pay his bills? Because they system is designed to fuck you over. \n\nSo I told the insurance company to eat my dick and take my son to court. Put him in default, let my 9 month old son default on his bills and we\u2019ll file bankruptcy. \n\nWell now my insurance company tells me that I am liable for his bills. Well that\u2019s actually great because I had insurance during that time! But guess what! Because the insurance companies write their own rules, I was somehow obligated but not named on my sons bills. \n\nIt\u2019s a fucking scam. The entire system is designed to put money in the pockets of middle men and to fuck over every single citizen.",

To share books means you live on campus which is very expensive, or you need a car because public transportation here, except for NY, is non-existent. Same if we want to use texts on campus library, or public libraries. \n\n> considering the sheer number of textbooks that would be bought by each student then remain unused after the course is done.\n\nYup.   I had 2 boxes of books that cannot be reused because the new editions.  \n\nPublishers have e-book but that just mean you pay for access for the duration of the course.",

My school was Upper Iowa University, a small private school (I was first generation college student, so I had NO idea private school is mostly a scam). The only nice thing was my biggest class had about 25 people.",

Typically tuition for public universities is somewhere around $6000-15000 per year, depending on the campus and the state. However, to attend a school in a different state from where someone lives, the person would have to pay \"out of state\" tuition which is often 3x the price. For example, the University of California (highest ranked public university in the country) costs $14k for in-state tuition, but it costs $44k for out-of-state.\n\nWhen you factor in the cost of housing, food, etc., it can really add up.\n\nMost states do offer very low-cost or even free tuition for local community colleges that can provide transfer credit for up to two years of classes to a larger 4-year public university, but many people don't consider this option. It doesn't help that many US states lack high-ranking public universities, so students opt to go out-of-state or private for a better school instead",

No more headaches, passing out, vision and hearing problems\u2026 mood swings and anger is all under control/a non issue anymore.

Due to the ambulance company making a mistake, it was billed *but* you can get that fixed with a phone call.\n2. It is now illegal (but this is due to Obamacare) for a hospital to surprise bill you with an out of network charge in this way.  The reason that a hospital can have out of network doctors is that for non-required procedures, it can make sense for a doctor to be at a hospital because they need to use a proper operating room, and can \"rent\" it as needed.  The gross part where one doctor required in a sequence would be out of network and bill like crazy was an oversight, and has been (in law at least) fixed.",

Four of these metrics were particularly useful for studying wait times.\n\n> On each of these metrics, the United States performed worse than several nations with universal coverage, though no individual nation outperforms the United States on every metric. For example, only 51 percent of U.S. patients reported being able to see a provider within a day, compared with 53 percent, 56 percent, and 67 percent of patients in Germany, France, and Australia, respectively.\n\n> Similarly, nearly 30 percent of U.S. doctors reported that their patients have difficulty getting a specialized test, compared with only 11 percent and 15 percent of doctors in Australia and Sweden, respectively. U.S. outcomes on the other two metrics were better across the board but still show that the United States performs worse than other nations with more equitable health care coverage systems. \n\n> For instance, in the United States, 4 percent of patients reported waiting four months or longer for nonemergency surgery, compared with only 2 percent of French patients and 0 percent of German patients. For specialist appointments, the situation is even worse: 6 percent of U.S. patients reported waiting two months or longer for an appointment, compared with only 4 percent of French patients and 3 percent of German patients.\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28186008/\n\n> Recent studies of medical errors have estimated errors may account for as many as 251,000 deaths annually in the United States (U.S)., making medical errors the third leading cause of death. Error rates are significantly higher in the U.S. than in other developed countries such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Germany and the United Kingdom.\n\nhttps://www.internationalinsurance.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ranking-11-best-international-healthcare-countries.png\n\n[#200 among 200 countries in cancer prevalence with 5.42%](https://ourworldindata.org/cancer#the-prevalence-of-cancer-around-the-world)\n\n[#44 in mortality rate from CVD, cancer, diabetes or CRD between ages 30 and 70 with 13.6%](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.DYN.NCOM.ZS)\n\n[#50 in neonatal (< 28 days) mortality rate with 3.4%](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.DYN.NMRT)\n\n[#51 in infant (< 1 year) mortality rate with 5.4%](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.IMRT.IN)\n\n[#48 in under-5 mortality rate with 6.3%](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.DYN.MORT)\n\n[#61 in maternal mortality rate with 19 per 100,000](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.STA.MMRT)\n\n[#53 in specialist surgical workforce with 54.71 per 100,000](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.MED.SAOP.P5)\n\n[#70 in hospital beds with 2.87 per 1,000](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.MED.BEDS.ZS)\n\n[#49 in life expectancy with 78.7 years](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.IN)\n\n[#42 in healthy life expectancy at birth with 66.1 years](https://apps.who.int/gho/data/view.main.HALEXv)\n\nUS healthcare is one of the worst in the developed world while also being the most expensive per head:\n\nhttps://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2020/jan/us-health-care-global-perspective-2019\n\n> Despite the highest spending, Americans experience worse health outcomes than their international peers. For example, life expectancy at birth in the U.S. was 78.6 years in 2017 \u2014 more than two years lower than the OECD average and five years lower than Switzerland, which has the longest lifespan. \n\n> Less-frequent physician visits may be related to the low supply of physicians in the U.S. compared with the other countries. The U.S. has slightly more than half as many physicians as Norway, which has the highest supply.\n\n> Premature deaths from conditions that are considered preventable with timely access to effective and quality health care, including diabetes, hypertensive diseases, and certain cancers, are termed \u201cmortality amenable to health care.\u201d This indicator is used by several countries to measure health system performance. The U.S. has the highest rates of amenable mortality among the 11 countries with 112 deaths for every 100,000. It is notable that the amenable mortality rate has dropped considerably since 2000 for every country in our analysis, though less proportionately in the U.S. The U.S. rate was two times higher than in Switzerland, France, Norway, and Australia. This poor performance suggests the U.S. has worse access to primary care, prevention, and chronic disease management compared to peer nations.\n\n> While the United States spends more on health care than any other country, we are not achieving comparable performance. We have poor health outcomes, including low life expectancy and high suicide rates, compared to our peer nations. A relatively higher chronic disease burden and incidence of obesity contribute to the problem, but the U.S. health care system is also not doing its part. Our analysis shows that the U.S. has the highest rates of avoidable mortality because of people not receiving timely, high-quality care. The findings from this analysis point to key policy implications, as well as opportunities to learn from other countries.\n\nhttps://www.americanprogress.org/issues/healthcare/reports/2019/10/18/475908/truth-wait-times-universal-coverage-systems/\n\n[1/3 of GoFundMe's are for healthcare costs in the US.](https://time.com/5516037/gofundme-medical-bills-one-third-ceo/)\n\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/health-care-costs-crowdfunding-medical-bills/\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_dumping\n\n[Your life expectancy is 4-5 years lower than the EU.](https://www.worldometers.info/demographics/life-expectancy/)\n\n\nOn a personal note, it costs me and everyone in the UK \u00a33200 ($4100) a year in taxes for the NHS.

This legislation will ban most forms of surprise billing, or balance billing, in which a person unknowingly gets medical care by a provider outside their private insurer\u2019s network, even when visiting an in-network facility. \n\n---\n\n> As of Jan. 1, patients shouldn\u2019t receive a surprise medical bill from an out-of-network provider in the following scenarios:\n\n> * When you receive emergency care in an emergency room\n\n> * **When you receive any care at an in-network health-care facility**\n\n> * When you are transported by an air ambulance (airplane or helicopter)\n\n>  As well, emergency care providers can\u2019t charge you out-of-network rates for services rendered once you\u2019re in stable condition, unless you provide consent and you\u2019re able to freely travel on your own to an available in-network provider.\n\n> **In these scenarios, the consumer will no longer be the middleman between their provider and insurer, and will only pay for in-network costs.** Any outstanding balance will have to be settled between insurers and the out-of-network medical providers. The law gives insurers and these providers 30 days to sort out discrepancies, and there\u2019s a new arbitration process for them to settle their disputes.\n\nThe ambulance ride is a different matter, but billing out-of-network rates for an anesthesiologist at an in-network hospital is no longer legal.",

That's 13% of the price they billed. \n\nThe govt should cap negotiated rates to a max 20% price reduction (if the insurance is willing to pay $158 then the max price of the service is $190) .

Anesthesia claims should be processed as in network, your sister may still be responsible for a larger sum than an in network one as they can bill the difference, but typically it's covered at 100% of reasonable and customary amounts. As for the ambulance being coded as not an emergency, you can always request it be reprocessed as emergency and if they say no, appeal the claim.",

C'est pas \"avoir de l'argent a la fin du mois\" OU \"rever a un universalisme republicain\", c'est les deux. Parce qu'en France, on vise les deux. Alors oui c'est plus dur, mais c'est aussi plus noble. Et c'est ce que cherche a atteindre la Republique francaise, ne t'en deplaise. \n\nJ'attends ton verbatim sur \"ptdr\", tes abbreviations de gamin de dix ans et tes emoticones de reforme P4 en guise de reponse. On va bien rire.",

              "text": "You joke, but it\u2019s not that easy. You have to show the first trimester scan to the midwife. Which should be easy enough if you were in France from the conception.\n\nIf however, you were in the US for the first trimester scan, like my wife and me, they only give you the measurements and send the actual picture/scan to your doctor. Except, if you don\u2019t have a doctor, which was our case, they keep it.\n\nSo, when my wife tried to declare her pregnancy, she went to see the midwife at the maternity where she had registered to give birth in, she does a scan of the baby\u2019s heartbeat, asks questions. Says the baby appears to be in good health and asks for the first trimester scan to complete the procedure. So we bring out our paper with the measurements, but she says she needs to see the full scan for a specific measurement that was not included there. She said she needed that one, otherwise she could not accurately tell the date of conception nor the due date. She then explained that if she couldn\u2019t do that, then she could not officially declare my wife, who had a growing belly with a heartbeat she had just heard in it, as pregnant. So for the French administration it was as if this baby didn\u2019t exist.\n\nWe were at week 14 at the time, so we figured we could get another scan and make up for it. Nope, apparently it\u2019s not as accurate afterwards. So this baby would not exist unless we got those measurements. Be that by constructing a Time Machine, going back in time two weeks and having the scan mande on time in France, or by having the US hospital send us the full records so we could transmit them to the French side. We opted for the second option, since it was just slightly easier. After singing a few forms and some frantic calls, we were able to get the necessary paperwork and our son started existing for the French administration.\n\nIt was a bit of a surreal experience. To make it worse, the conception day she gave us was off by two days, despite us telling her that it was impossible, since we didn\u2019t make the deed until two days later. She still said we were wrong. So I guess I have time-traveling sperm.",

Insurers could cover more stuff (rarely), but they always cover whatever Medicaid offers. So insurers are never going to get legally prosecuted for not covering childbirth and prenatal care because both are covered under Medicaid. Infant care kind of a train wreck though.",

There aren't any such laws on the books or in the pipeline, though I believe the Louisiana one could  be interpreted that way and, if I recall, has no provision excluding IUDs etc.\n\nYes, the Louisiana bill, to my reading, seems to be squarely aimed at making taking Plan B pills illegal by defining a person as including a fertilized egg, thereby making the homicide statute apply to fertilized eggs. Of note, they specifically removed proposed language that would have defined a person from the point of fertilization \"and  implantation,\" which makes it clear they didn't want to require implantation in order to count. This bill would, then, make it homicide to prevent implantation of a fertilized egg. That happens to also be exactly what IUDs do, however there are some nuanced questions of legal procedure at that point.\n\nMainly, implanting an IUD is an action that is taken before you have sex. My memory of criminal procedure and the constitutional requirements involved is a bit rusty, but I'm fairly sure that there is a problem with trying to charge a person for homicide because they took an action (implanting an IUD) that later had the effect of causing the death of a person (a fertilized egg) that did not yet exist when the action was taken.\n\nYou maybe could finagle some sort of attempted homicide out of the fact that the only purpose of implanting an IUD is to cause the effect of \"murdering\" fertilized eggs, but I think it would still be a problem that the \"victim\" didn't exist when you made the \"attempt\" to kill them. It's closer to some sort of recklessness, like setting a booby trap that has the intended purpose of killing whoever triggers it, regardless of not knowing who if anyone will trigger it. But even then, how can you ever prove that it actually happened? You'd somehow have to gather evidence that the woman with the IUD had sex that resulted in fertilization. (Of note, a variation of this problem would exist for charging a woman with use of Plan B pills. If she takes them after having sex, she *might* be \"killing\" a fertilized egg by preventing implantation, or she might not be. At best you could say that she intended to kill one if it existed, which would, I think, be something like recklessness at best.)\n\nAlso note that this bill hasn't been brought to a full vote in Louisiana yet, and it is like ridiculously extremist. In fact, maybe crazier than the attempt to make fertilized eggs people in the eyes of the law, it explicitly says that no federal laws can overrule it, and instructs Louisiana law enforcement and courts to ignore any federal court decisions purporting to overturn it -- including *Roe* -- and enforce it anyway. So they're saying even if *Roe* doesn't get overturned we're criminalizing abortion. That's, like, Civil War secessionist type shit.",

As best I can tell, they think this would work because the bill declares that it is Constitutional, and that no other authority in the land can supercede the Constitution, therefore no actions to stop the law by any government or courts, including the Supreme Court, are valid. This would be comical if it wasn't so directly aimed at the fabric of the nation.",

Due to health issues I cannot take the pill, and my only form of contraception beyond condoms is stuff like the IUD (admittedly the non-hormonal one so I'm not 100% if that would change the argument). Either way, the reason they would consider implanting it is to reduce the pain of periods and enable me to function properly again - i.e. the purpose is not always to \"murder\" the potential future fertilised eggs.

Even if one could argue that preventing implantation of fertilized eggs is a known potential effect of an IUD, it makes it very weird to try to argue even the requisite recklessness for something looks manslaughter. \n\nAfter all, how many things do people do for a safe purpose that could also unintentionally cause some unknown person to die if conditions are right?",

Because that is how the \"kid\" ends up in the \"basement\", so assuming you're concious and know how your contraceptive works, the other commenter was pretty spot on with their metaphor. You do have knowledge of this happening. At the very least you'd be charged with gross negligence for leaving the door open and inviting a bunch of kids to go play down there.\n\nConservatives think women should just not have sex if they don't want to get pregnant. Some of them have literally gone on record with shit like \"keep your legs closed, problem solved\". So by their logic, if you have sex, you accept the risk - and by purposefully ensuring that the fertilized egg will die *when* this happens (not if), you are in fact actively encouraging and condoning the death of a \"conceived\" human being. You decided to have sex knowing that this event has a high likelihood of occurring.\n\nIt's batshit insane of course, because a fertilized egg cell is not and cannot possibly be considered a human being yet. But that is how they see it, and you thinking someone this crazy will fall for your \"well *technically*\" argument is rather naive.",

Intention is *widely agreed upon* as a  necessary component of immoral behavior, but certainly not universally accepted. It's pretty trivial to come up with thought experiments that challenge it. If a guy decides he wants to kill his wife and goes to the range for some target practice and then accidentally shoots someone who improperly walks downrange, was his action immoral? Then you get into the weeds with questions like \"were tobacconists immoral before the health consequences of smoking were known?\"\n\nEdit: And anyways, even if we do put the onus of immorality (or at least a significant part of it) on intent, an IUD still satisfies a staunchly pro-life criteria for immorality.\n\nIF you believe life is created when a sperm fertilizes an egg.\n\nAND you use a contraceptive that you understand will allow the egg to be fertilized and not prevent fertilization entirely.\n\nTHEN you have intentionally allowed a life to be created and ended.",

The only reason they exist is to make profit. If they stop making profit, they stop existing.\n\nThey are not insuring people to be nice. They are insuring people because, on average, this gets them more money than they have to pay out.\n\nThe same will be true with fetuses. I'm sure they will be willing to insure them. At a cost that is calculated to net them a profit. So sure, maybe some people will miscarry and make some quick cash. But far more commonly, people will be out more money and insurance companies will rake it in. Is that what you want?",

This potentially would be a problem if the person is in the waiting period before benefits are effective. \n\nOne other fun wrinkle is that if both parents have different insurance coverage the child must be covered by the person whose birthday occurs earliest in the year, this is called \u201cthe birthday rule.\u201d\n\n\nSource: worked in benefits administration for 5 years.",

SSN generally isn\u2019t needed for dependent\u2019s for coverage (usually throws a warning at worst), I believe it IS needed for reporting to the IRS. \n\nYes a name would be needed, and if the child was born alive there would be a certificate of live birth which would need a name. I have seen things like Baby, Boy, or Girl entered as names into benefits systems. \n\nNot making lite of the situation, just saying insurance should cover it and there are avenues to get the coverage in place.  Having known women and babies who almost died during childbirth, it is extremely traumatic with a lot of self blaming going on. Not the situation where you want to be reminded yet again of what happened during an attempt to collect money. \n\nThis os a situation where you tell your benefits manager / HR team that you just received a bill for your deceased child who should have been covered by insurance and THEY take care of it. \n\nThis all assumes that insurance out of pockets have been met which usually happens with a hospital birth unless you have a SUPER HIGH out of pocket or separate coverages and subject to the birthday rule.\n\nEdit:\nSource: worked in benefits administration",

The pot and the marinated meat. Of course, don\u2019t forget chopping your onions and what not. Cooking is a skill. The reason why most of y\u2019all can\u2019t do it as well is because we started cooking when we were little. Like I started at 9-10 years old. Cooking rice for me can be done with my eyes closed and I don\u2019t need measurements. It\u2019s  deep within the culture. I just eyeball seasoning meat too. And I\u2019m early twenties. \ud83d\ude04\n\nYou\u2019ll get there! Just be patient with yourself and remember, it\u2019s a skill.\n\nEdit: I want to remind a real cast iron pot is those black pots that you don\u2019t clean with soap and use animal fat to burn it in. That is what makes the gravy amazing. I\u2019ll admit we also cheat because most of our pots are like old family heirlooms. Many are over 50 years old of making chicken sauce piquant. \u263a\ufe0f",

They dislike American politics and regularly the American government, most of the time when it has an R in the presidents party. That said, even with Democrats, it can be difficult at times.\n\nWho is not disliked are Americans as long as they don't show their support for these politics. From my experience (German), the criticism given to the US is from a position of still caring because the US is yet not a lost cause. Russia and China are not criticised the same way because they are lost causes, not allies, not even potential ones, they are open autocratic. The US has symptoms of an autocracy, but still people fighting against it, and still a real struggle. As long as that is alive, the people fighting that fight for a modern democracy will always not be disliked by the vast majority here (again, from my experience)",

No 23 euro to see the m\u00e9decin g\u00e9n\u00e9raliste, no mutuelle to pay some of your charges, no \"pay now, get partially reimbursed later\". Always. \n\nBUT... it is all swings and roundabouts - nothing is \"free\". \n\nYou pay for it in taxes. Some countries pay more taxes, some pay less. The whole \"my country is better than yours\" argument is superficial at best and doesn't take all factors into account. For example, longer waiting times in the UK are the sacrifice for the lack of money exchange and reduced administration compared to France. In the US, you pay if you choose to through insurance, like road users in France pay for the roads with tolls. Tolls don't exist in the UK. Every single road is \"free\". \n\nWhich system is better? Personally in this instance for example, charging only road users to use roads rather than a general tax seems fair to me. \n\nHowever health is not roads. We could argue that having a system where every single person is covered equally, is far more human and \"fair\" than those disgusting American capitalists charging people for access to decent healthcare, right? Is it fair that someone who doesn't smoke and eats healthily should pay the same amount as someone who eats Croques Monsieur every day with a Marlboro light and double espresso? Maybe. Maybe not... it depends on everyone's equally valid perspective. \n\nThere are many different systems and each has their own advantages and usually a logical explanation behind them. Let's stop the US bashing and for the love of God stop pretending everything in France is perfect. It really, really isn't.",

They don\u2019t have to have over night anaesthetist cover, if the patient deteriorates they can transfer them to an NHS facility for ITU care.

Yes, if you choose an index fund, you are usually nearly, guaranteed a healthy return. But, not everyone is in the Indexed Fund - if they were, then, it might not do as well. AND, who you chose to invest in with the SS fund would have \"ramifications.\" Gee, wouldn't some insider want to know where that money was going to flow before it bought stock?\n\nAnd, doesn't anyone timing the market know that when the Baby Boomers retire we will have to withdraw a bit more than we put in? Wouldn't that make the market go down?\n\nThe entire concept of \"making money for nothing\" with investments is predicated on someone else losing, or more opportunity created by companies using that money wisely. These savvy investors have now found that money makes money, better than capital improvements on businesses. So, it's no longer about growing the pie. Only 5% of stock proceeds now go to capital improvements. That should be a red flag about how full of hot air this scheme is.\n\nSavvy investors will game the shit out of a privatized stock market, and like the suckers on Wall Street, leave them with the shorted stocks.\n\nAnd, back to healthcare -- your point about \"private healthcare providers will bid for the lucrative ops\" -- is just on target. Imagine that we do a private/public arrangement with health insurance. The public will get all the chronically sick people and the insurance providers will get all the healthy people who don't need hospital treatments. We get to insure people over 65, for sure. What a great deal, right?\n\nWe get all the losing stocks, and all the sick patients, and the private money makers who are so much smarter, will get all the \"winners.\" Then, say; \"government never works.\" But, not want to privatize more because this is working great for them. Full privatization means they'll take all the money they can, then go \"oops!\" when it goes bankrupt and then point fingers. Legislation will pass promising never to do that again, but nobody will go to jail. It will be a complete mystery how the tragedy happened.",

I do wonder if private healthcare providers should be responsible for the costs to the NHS of their patients. \n\nFor example I had a lady who had an infected hip replacement from a bupa procedure. She spent about 10 days on ICU and had 3 or 4 operations during that time. I don\u2019t know how long she was on the ward after that but it will have been at several weeks.

I'm sure it's the same people sponsoring \"Brexit.\"\n\nThe oligarchy wants to undermine the fear of \"one world government\" -- because, that will shut down YOUR POWER. Only, does it really? Are we not losing all these things anyway? What do I want to do, that Germans or Dutch or Spanish people would prevent me from doing? If there is any tyranny, it's from religious groups, racists, or corporations and their fans. If the Department of Motor Vehicles gets too much control -- well, that's another thing to deal with. \n\nUltimately it's the same thing over and over again; \"break everyone up and get them fighting.\" The poor person in Gloucester gets the whisper; \"Germans are getting a better deal -- do you WANT them to get your stuff?\" And they fight to be free of European unity, so that their local robber barons can take their stuff instead of those freeloaders in Germany! \n\nThe argument against healthcare is often couched as some undeserving group getting more than their fair share. \"Did you know some union guy can slack off and get $2 more an hour?\" Can't have that! So, we stop the Union so a few executives can get $2,000 more per hour -- problem solved!\n\nThe people of greed want to appeal to our greed and fear. We give up the good things we have to prevent worse things that could potentially happen. We guarantee we are cheated, so that people lower down the ranks don't catch up to us. Better to throw that money at the people above and hope some of it trickles down. \n\nOnly when people are at the bottom, does their self serving nature work to change the status quo -- and THAT is what is happening now with the USA and Trumpism. The fans of Reagan and trickle-down are now not sure they will benefit from being rich, so they want to make sure the other poor stay lower than them. To return to a time where they were slightly better off than all the \"shit hole countries in the world.\" \n\nWhat happens when nobody wants to cross our borders any more? I'm sure a new target of blame that didn't enjoy the massive profits will be found.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I think I went far away from NHS - but, I think the mindset attacking all these institutions that help the many -- the reason we HAVE governments in the modern world, are under threat. The masses are attacking the supports under their feet because they've learned it might prop up immigrants.",

I wasn't sure if it was worth going to hospital or waiting my injury out which is why I phoned. Nobody was at home and if I was asked to come into a&e I'd literally be unable to.\n\nThey said it was fine as it was a non emergency (not life threatening) and I'd go to minor injuries, which is all done by booking in over the phone cos of COVID (and to reduce wait times in a&e). My injury was at 2pm, appointment at 6.30pm. wasn't seen until 8pm.\n\nWhile I waited, a&e were triaging people to minor injuries. I saw people coming in that I don't know why they went to a&e. Guy had a non active bleeding cut to his arm that had a plaster on it and someone got wheeled in for something to do with his leg but he was walking about in the waiting room.\n\nI dislocated my knee, popped it back in myself after 2 hours waiting on someone coming home as I was told I needed my jeans off for assessment. I walked into minor injuries and left in crutches. If I lived alone, and wasn't able to pop my knee back in, I'd have needed an ambulance to come get me to at least pop my knee back in. They'd probably have taken me straight to minor injuries mind you. \n\nBut sprains can be really fucking bad, where a break would have been less painful and easier to heal; and before x-rays, can appear to be breaks (especially ankles). So I wouldn't be casting judgement on someone getting an ambulance for a sprain.\n\nSome folk either: don't have the money for taxis or buses to hospital, don't have any other transport or unable to access any transport because of their injuries. So what else can they do?!",

I'm disabled, have several chronic health conditions and have lived in both the US and the UK, where I still reside.  Wait times in the emergency department are about the same in both places though, in my personal experience, I'd say it's generally a bit faster to receive both emergency support and general doctor/specialist appointments in the UK though I appreciate that this was greatly impacted in at least 2020 and 2021 because of the pandemic as they tried to limit non-urgent face-to-face care in order to reduce potential transmission\n\n When in the US, I had insurance that covered almost all costs as long as I received treatment \"in network,\" which is itself strangely difficult because even though you may go to a hospital that's within your network the actual doctor/surgeon/specialist you see may be out of network, which you are not told about in real-time and means you end up having to pay more even though you did everything right. As a side note, there were also times in which I needed to see a specialist but there were no such 'in-network' specialists within the wider area I lived so I had no choice but to pay out of pocket for this. But I digress. \n\nTo give a similar example to your own, I once fractured my left arm in 4 places due to having shit bones and I ended up waiting over 8 hours at an 'in-network' emergency room before being seen. At the time we weren't sure exactly what damage had been done but I'm definitely glad we went straight to the ER given how serious it ended up being. With this in mind, I totally agree with you that although there are certainly people in A&E that probably should've gone to minor injuries which, in turn, can waste time and mean that people in need wait longer than they should, it can simply just be difficult to know how bad something is\n\nBoth countries have issues but I cannot stress enough how much better the NHS is across the board and, again, I say this as someone who had some of the best US private healthcare, or at least, the best that's accessible to most people as obviously this sort of thing doesn't matter to rich people. It genuinely pains me to see some people/tories talking about how much better privitisation will be when that has simply not been the case in my experience in terms of both actual treatment received and general health care systems e.g., wait times. I just wish the NHS was better funded so that it could cover the actual staff and support needed to make it run smoother",

Insurance companies do you a favor to back bill your child\u2019s care AFTER they are enrolled. If they are never enrolled the mother gets the bill. Oh and she is billed as if the child has no insurance, because well they don\u2019t.",

How close are we to taxation without representation in this country right now?\n\nIf you have representation and they don't listen to anything their constituents have to say or ask for, is that still representation? We are taxed to fuck and it goes to nothing tangible. Even our roads are fucking awful in most cases, we get nothing for what is taken from us. In fact most of it is spent on weapons of war to make the rest of the world hate us more. I am exhausted of our country a this point.\n\nWhat do we have to be positive about for the future? Near or distant?",

My point is not to compare death tolls or claim communism\u2019s history is better; it is merely that the argument put forth about communism\u2019s death toll being greater than capitalism\u2019s is disingenuous, ahistorical, and always made in bad faith - basically proving the poster who you were originally responding too\u2019s point. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a worthwhile or accurate argument to make. If you want to argue about \u201cperception\u201d of communism vs. capitalism in terms of legitimate fear\u2026 it would mostly be in reference to who you are, whether you have reason to fear. If your entire family was murdered by a death squad working for an oil company in Nicaragua - you would also have legitimate reason to fear capitalism. If you think human-caused climate change is causing unprecedented flooding and fires and are in an area where this may destroy your home, you might be (legitimately or illegitimately) scared of capitalism. It\u2019s just not really a strong argument against communism when it can be equally applied to capitalism, so not an argument worth making imo.",

Now we are experiencing an acceleration of inflation given what the government has done during the pandemic.\n\nWhen people say wages aren't keeping up with inflation, ask yourself why wages need to go up in the first place. If money wasn't constantly debased, prices would only fluctuate but would not endlessly grow over decades. Wages wouldn't need to grow just to retain purchasing power.\n\nThe idea of negotiating up wages is never going to keep up with inflation. When negotiating something, the status quo always has the default power. So wages always lag, as history has shown.\n\nWe need a non-state controlled fixed supply currency. Unfortunately Bitcoin won't grow large enough for a decade or more. But at least it can act as a protest and long term store of value as we slowly opt out of the dollar.",

They give everyone money, then create so much inflation it completely cancels out any benefit that money may have provided and worse.\n\nNow we are experiencing artificial inflation (money debasement) and real inflation (scarcity of products) at the same time.

The notion that it cannot go away just because its price is stable is naive.\n\nBitcoin payment infrastructure has already rolled out in a massive way. I can go into a McDonalds, Chipotle, Wholefoods, Home Depot, and the list goes on right here in the US. Every single NCR and Blackhawk machine (those scanning guns and the self checkout booths you see in stores) are already integrated with the lightning network such that I can spend my Bitcoin without the use of a debit/credit card. No banks involved, peer 2 peer private transactions.\n\nAs for the volatility, yes it's still only the [25th largest currency in the world today and only 2% the market cap of USD circulating supply](https://fiatmarketcap.com/Country). But it's also the only one growing its way up that list over time. It cannot be adopted and stable at the same time, it's just not mathematically possible due to the fact that adoption and price appreciation are the same thing.\n\nIt builds into a speculative frenzy over and over until certain individuals have made so much money they are incentivized to sell. It wants to grow faster than it can because price appreciation this rapid has to come back down as people see life changing money.\n\nBut ultimately, I believe we are emerging from this and starting to see diminishing returns that will greatly reduce the volatile swings. In the next decade it's very likely the curve flattens out to a much more reasonable fluctuation rate. Until then, it's an investment in the idea that Bitcoin can become a non-state money.",

Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, France, Australia, and UK all have a higher homelessness rate per 10k citizens than the US. Remember the US is much larger than all other first world countries. Bigger number doesn't mean bigger problem.\n3. Well yeah, the US is a massive country where guns are *far* more prevalent due to how their country was formed and their constitution. They're obviously going to have more gun violence. I'm not gonna defend the violence because it's all awful no matter where you are, but it's better to just say their violence in general is higher, rather than gun violence.",

I just pointed out that saying many third world countries rank higher than the US in education is incorrect.\n2. I think I'm misunderstanding your point here maybe. By definition, if a country has a higher rate of homelessness per capita, that country has a bigger homelessness problem than a bigger country with a lower rate per capita. \n3. Gun buybacks have proven to be fairly ineffective to reduce violence. The problem is people who are committing crimes aren't going to just give up their illegal guns. Like here in the UK with knives. Violent criminals steal all the knives from amnesty bins because the problem isn't the knives, it's the criminals. \n\nThe US definitely has a bigger violence problem than a lot of other countries, and guns are a part of it, but the difference in violent crime would be negligible considering the hoops that would have to be jumped through to change the 2nd amendment. Think about that, in forming their country the SECOND thing they wrote into the constitution was that they have the right to bear arms. That's what happens when a tyrannical government treats you like dirt for so long that you'd rather die than keep living under it, and that's what it's there to defend.\n\nThe problem is how far technology has come, at what point is it about a militia, and how much could a militia do nowadays? There are so many guns in circulation there, it's impossible to control them. I've got no idea how to do that realistically, but it's not really my problem I guess.",

              "text": "And it's simple enough why it is happening. The only civil way to create the change we want is through government legislation and that is created by politicians. But when politicians require large sums of money to win elections due to drawn out campaigning, then the only people who stand a chance to win are those whose morality allows them to essentially accept bribes from corporations in order to fun their campaigns. \n\nThe politicians end up representing the companies, not the citizens, because it is the companies who fund their political campaigns. It's that simple. For example, Ted Cruz ran a $66 million presidential campaign and 78% of it came from super PACs, which are essentially loophole organizations that allow corporations to invest large sums of money to politicians. \n\nThe way to keep your job as a US politician is to vote in ways that keep your corporate donors happy while simultaneously walking a tightrope to keep your constituents happy. They tell lies to their constituents, because that's what they have to do in order to keep getting votes. It relies on people not paying attention to how the politicians are actually voting. The master lie of the politician is \"I am trying to help you, but all these other politicians are trying to hurt you. So vote for me.\" And it works... Congress has only a 20% approval rating as a whole (with only 4% of people having no opinion). Meanwhile, 53% of people approve of the way the representative from their own congressional district is handling their job and 12% have no opinion.",

This isn't a bug as much as a feature, but without a central, regularly updated registry of people like most European countries have, *counting* the number of homeless people is difficult. I wouldn't be surprised if there's a significant shadow number here.\n\nThe other thing is that the US is fairly unique in the developed world with the respect that homelessness can happen by financial circumstances in isolation. It's surprisingly difficult to be homeless due to poverty alone in most of those counties - it's usually due to a mixture of mental health issues, social issues *and* poverty. America has many many more healthy, well-adjusted people that literally just can't afford to live anywhere.",

Specifically, I think Americans understand the concept of insurance just fine; they know that when they pay for insurance they are contributing to a pool of money that is used to pay for any contributor that ends up needing it. \n\nSo, what do anti-universal healthcare people have a problem with, and what don't they understand? \n\nFor one, some argue that it should be up to them if they want to choose to buy insurance or not, rather than being forced to buy insurance in the form of paying taxes for universal healthcare. They can choose to just save the money that would go to insurance and if they never need it then it's theirs to do with as they please (or, more likely, they can just spend that money as they go and choose to take the risk that they end up in medical debt forever if they get seriously ill). \n\nIMO this view is based on poorly formed risk perception, but otherwise I think they're right in theory: if they don't buy any insurance, if their taxes aren't going to any insurance, and if they never need any medical care, they will end up with more money than they would otherwise. I question how many people that argue this *actually* don't have any insurance, though.\n\nNext, I think some people with insurance are okay with other people in their plan being able to access the shared pool, but view it as a question of earning that privilege. Like, if other people can afford to buy the same insurance, then it's fair that they get the same access. But they do not think it's fair to let someone who can't pay into the pool share in the benefits, and they assume (hopefully correctly) that a universal healthcare system would indeed let everyone get care regardless of how much they pay in taxes.\n\nThis view is probably more indicative of the average anti-universal healthcare person. Sucks if you can't afford insurance, but only people who have paid into their plan deserve to be able to use it.\n\nHere's where the misunderstanding is, I think: \n\nFirst, they don't realize that hospitals already charge prices to their insurance company that factor in the costs that the hospitals have to recoup from giving emergency care to uninsured people (or people with shitty insurance that doesn't cover their needs) since we (thankfully) don't allow hospitals to deny lifesaving care because you can't pay. Or, they realize this and think that hospitals should be allowed to let people die if they can't pay, which is at least ideologically consistent, I guess.\n\nSecond, they don't realize that Medicaid is socialized medicine that they already pay for with their taxes, and which covers (some) people who can't afford private insurance. In fact, a pretty high percentage of medical care in the US is covered by Medicaid. Or, they might realize it and think that Medicaid needs to be gutted, which would again at least be ideologically consistent.",

Countries like Canada and the UK made the moral decision that all people deserve equal medical care, priced according to income (that is to say, income taxes), while the US made the decision that only wealthy people deserve care.\n\nCanada went even further on the \"equal\" part and outright banned private medical procedures that are offered by public health care because they realized that the mere *existence* of private insurance for normal care creates a two-tiered system, which is explicitly against the aims of universal health care (unfortunately, Canada does not extend this to dental care).

I have seen a lot of people explicitly argue that we can't give universal healthcare coverage because then everyone that doesn't currently have coverage would clog up all the hospitals and wait times would be too long.\n\nGranted, they usually phrase this as if people would just, like, go make appointments they don't need just because of the novelty of being able to, like \"people would be going to the doctor every time they scrape their knee\" kind of claims, which seem absurd. And that's not to mention the fact that currently uninsured people clog up ERs with critical illnesses (and cost hospitals tons of money that they then recoup through what they charge paying patients) because they couldn't afford much faster and cheaper preventative care.",

To paraphrase Alexis de Tocqueville, don't be so enamored of equality that you would rather be equal in slavery than unequal in freedom.\n\nHere's the thing, though. Leaving aside whether your assertions are true (because for some reason I only ever see Americans claiming that Canadians or Britons have to wait too long for critical procedures), if you live in a democracy, like Canada, and you aren't happy with the public healthcare that is being provided by the democratic government, you can vote for people to change it.\n\nWhat can you do in the US? The obvious answer would be \"switch your insurance provider,\" I suppose. Well, a huge amount of people are on employer subsidized healthcare that they have no choice in. Changing jobs just for healthcare is absurd to have to consider, although I have seen it. And yes, you can opt out and buy your own insurance directly, but what are the chances you will find something better for a price you can afford?\n\nIn fact, how can you even know if it's better? Seriously, all I have ever been able to find out about insurance before signing up is the monthly premiums, the deductible, and maybe lifetime caps. I have no idea what it will actually cover. Like, I have kids who have various therapies and medications prescribed to them, and I've asked the insurance rep for my employer whether they cover those things and how much, and they don't know (or won't say). The only way to find out is to sign up for the insurance and try to bill them. I have my own prescriptions and my doctor has no idea what my insurance will cover. I don't know until I get to the register and have to decide whether to pay for the copay or not. Ludicrous.\n\nOr, how about this: what do you do if no insurance plans cover what you need? You could lobby Congress to legislate a mandate for insurance to cover you, I guess. But like, it seems that it would be a lot more efficient if the government could directly control that rather than having to regulate private insurers and then monitor and enforce the regulations on them.",

She went to the hospital, they suspected cancer and did a scan, and the same day she was flown 1000 km to Vancouver for treatment (some form of leukemia). She's still there because she needs weekly treatment that can't be provided at home, and I believe she receives a daily stipend for living expenses. All of this, provided for free, with no questions of or worries about payment or insurance coverage.\n\nIf you need/want a hip replacement, yeah, you're probably going to wait a year, and that's fine. It's not like that happens suddenly, and the condition won't suddenly worsen. But if you need a hip replacement, you *will* receive one, even if it takes a while.

                      "text": "> No...it's more about the fact that when government gets involved with paying for something, there is a HUGE amount of waste.  Private companies demand efficency.   \n  Yes, insurance companies are about profit, but the profit is transparent.  It's on their financial statements, so you know how much went to the owners vs. to paying for patient care. \n\nMy main problem with this argument is that it seems to assume that the alleged inefficiencies of government would outweigh the costs of the private insurance industry, which is functionally one giant inefficiency added to health care. \n\nThere's an entire section of healthcare professionals devoted to insurance billing and collections. Doctors' offices and hospitals hire people whose entire job is filling out insurance billing forms and knowing how to code things to get insurance to pay for it. This is pure wasteful bureaucracy. \n\nThe other issue with this argument is, of course, that we have plenty of other countries to look at. Somehow the US spends more money per capita than developed nations with universal healthcare systems, yet we get worse results overall. So, how exactly are these government run programs that cover everyone, spend less per person doing so, and still get better outcomes, less efficient than our privatized system?",

Literally across the street. \n\nI went to a doc in a box across from the hospital because it was COVID times and not a major emergency in my eyes, just some really bad chest pain. They took my vitals and looked at my history and decided I might be having a heart attack so they wanted me to go to the ER at the hospital directly across the street. I got up to just drive or walk on over and they said no because of a liability on their part if I had a heart even and dropped dead or caused some accident so I had to be transported by ambulance. I BEGGED them not to (truly sad because I have relatively great insurance, who my husband literally works for!). I even asked if a nurse could just walk me over. But no. Here comes the ambulance (which arrived in about 10 minutes and I could\u2019ve walked in less than 2 minutes!) No IV, no meds, no oxygen, nothing. Just a ride. I told jokes and they laughed (they should be paying ME!). Two weeks later, a bill for a little over $4,400 to the ambulance company, some $50 to my city for ambulance fees (WTF?!), and some $300 bill to I don\u2019t even know but it references the ambulance ride.\n\nEdit:\nThanks to everyone saying I should\u2019ve just walked out anyway. I think I was clouded by having been told I was having a heart issue and nervousness that I just wasnt even thinking clearly. Plus I was hooked up to all kinds of things that they didn\u2019t remove until I was moved onto the ambulance gurney. But trust me, next time (hopefully won\u2019t need one) I\u2019m outta there!",

And then do research to figure out if they're covered by your plan.  And don't forget you'd have to be doing all this while thinking \"They just told me I'm probably having a heart attack.\"",

We are covered in shit, but Americans would associate 'freedom and liberty' itself with not taking a shower far before they would reveal their true motives, let alone actually crafting bipartisan legislation that is functional and beneficial to a wider breadth of people. \n\nAnd finally, you have the voters (the vocal minority) whose blind passion and anti-intellectual foundation into their political ideologies and the leaders of those parties gives them no chance at actually objectively (as best we can be) digest the issues that matter to them, and compare options of compromises and benefits for everyone. \n\nOur policies are fucked because our politics are fucked, which are fucked because of money in politics and 24/7 news (and by name, fuckbags like Tucker Carlson), which is fucked because of our constant anxiety and fear about our health (shit healthcare) our kids (shit child care) our education (insanely expensive, hard to start and stay with because of any of the other reasons), our housing, and our paychecks- considering most Americans live paycheck to paycheck. \n\nFear runs this country, not our democracy.",

Too much misinformation and ignorance in the way of engaging with the topic as objectively as possible. And those citizens that have informed themselves and have seen the system for what it is (a nightmare) don't have, or don't believe they have, the power to change it.",

I have medical insurance - I thought I might get a bill for $250-300 tops. I waited some 15 minutes before my name was called. I sat down, a nurse took my vitals, then the doctor saw me, asked some questions, and realized my situation wasn't serious, so he wrote a prescription and sent me home. Note, that the doctor did not lay a hand on my body while I was there. The whole ordeal took 25 minutes. The next week, I received a bill for $870 which explained that my visit was a Level 3 ER visit. I did some investigation on the meaning of ER levels. Level 3 would have required the hospital to take liquids from my body, urine, blood, etc. I should've been Level 4, which defined my visit that evening. I fought this with their bill department. They investigated the matter and figured that my visit and the appropriate bill sent to me was legitimate. So, I got my insurance involved and explained to them that this hospital was involved in fraudulent activities and that they should investigate it. A few weeks later, my insurance got back to me and concluded that the hospital is within their right to bill me how they see fit, however, because of my complaint, among others, they have the power to stop being partners or drop them from the network, which in my opinion, is a bigger blow to them. A few days later, I got a new bill from the hospital with a $300 reduction. I am still contemplating whether I should pay or just fuck all, not pay at all.",

Hell, even some of the poor ones don't want payouts because when they eventually get rich (\"the American Dream\" is a hell of a drug) they don't want to give their money to help others. \n\nAnd all of that while believing that they are the most free country out there - hell, they even call their president \"the leader of the free world\", as if no other countries in the world are free - when in fact, when you look at it from outside, they are slowly falling into Saudi Arabia levels of freedom.\n\nSo yeah, they don't vote for people who can change this, because thanks to 200+ years of American propaganda, they don't believe there is anything wrong with their country.\n\n'Murica!",

All that paid through taxes.\n\nYes, and so does most of Europe. Maybe you don't remember what happened after the collapse of the Soviet Union. At the time the neoliberals where jumping in joy and declaring that socialism is dead and there is only one alternative, which is the full free market economy and all well functioning public services have to be run down and replaced by market solutions. Of course they got a big kick in the face when capitalism had to rescued from itself in 2008. \n\nMy point was that the US is not the only place where the right wing keeps pushing their propaganda on bad public services, \"leeching\" unemployed and all the rest. This despite the fact that poll after poll shows that people want equal society where everyone is taken cared of. \n\nAnd the interesting thing is that the US population wants this as well. When you ask people about issues (like healthcare, education, etc.) separate from which party supports what, they overwhelmingly support the left wing policies. If you then ask \"do you vote for Republicans or Democrats\", the result is much closer to 50-50. So, it is really stupidity. It is not that they believe in the right wing propaganda that good public services are bad, but that they still vote for Republicans. \n\n>Did you miss the whole saga where people were gassed out of a Washington street, during the Black Lives Matter protests, because 45th wanted to do a photo op in front of a church holding a Bible in his hand? \n\nNo, I didn't miss that. Did you miss the part where the [Finnish parliament starts their yearly session with a religious ceremony](https://www.eduskunta.fi/FI/tiedotteet/Sivut/Valtiopaivien-avajaiset-2.-helmikuuta-%E2%80%93-Seuraa-suoria-verkkolahetyksia.aspx)? I have no problem with *individual* politicians being religious. That's their freedom. I'm talking about state functions tied with the church. \n\n>Are you going to ignore that laws permitting abortion are being repealed, preventing women to do whatever they want with their body, all in the name of the Bible?\n\nThat has nothing to do with the freedom of religion. That goes back to Hume's guillotine. There is no objective right that we can derive from objective facts. If some people want to take their values from a religion, then that's their right. I'm pro-choice myself, but I fully acknowledge that it's based on my subjective values and there are other people with different values. \n\n> I mean, their own money says \"In God We Trust\"...\n\nYou are right, this part indeed breaks the freedom of religion. The money printed by the state should not refer to any religion. \n\n>Seriously, the people of the US need to open their eyes and wake up! They are one of the least free countries in the world.\n\nThat's not right. I've lived in the US and it was a lot more free than many others. It may not be the freest country, but definitely more free than unfree. This from the liberal definition of freedom. Of course if you count it as a restriction to your freedom that you don't have economic means to do things, then I would drop the US lower in the ranking.",

If you have  progressive taxes, the tax burden to the low and middle income people is not that high. \n\nIt would limit their fantasy income (\"when I become a billionaire, I don't want to be paying high taxes\") but almost none of them does. Most people who are poor now, will be poor for the rest of their lives (students excluded).\n\nAnd are you saying that the level of understanding of how public services work in the US is such that people don't know that if you want to improve them, it usually costs tax money? \n\nIf that's so, are the people who oppose Medicare for all or free university tuition doing that purely because they are cruel? They don't care about the cost (as with your explanation they don't even know about it) but they just don't want other people to have healthcare and education?",

I would imagine a doctor, or really anyone about to have a baby, would have the sense to learn this process?\n\nI'm giving this person the benefit of the doubt that she misunderstood somehow, because I would certainly hope the people using social media to depress voting wouldn't stoop to the level of fabricating a story about a dead baby.",

Politicians in Canada and the USA are CONSTANTLY arguing that a Physician will choose to work in the USA over Canada because they don't make any money in Canada.   \n\n\nThis physician is like a poster child for that argument. She works at a hospital that is owned by a Kaiser Permanente and is a quasi 'celebrity' author of books on her area of speciality.   \n\n\nI understand that people migrate for countless reasons. I just think it is important for complete transparency in discussion. If someone works in medicine, is employes by one of the largest providers of Medical Insurance in the USA, chose that career over a single payer system in their homeland where they trained and also chose working for that insurer over working in a public hospital in the USA then I think that is important to discuss.",

So I got charged 2k for being seen for 2 minutes by a doc and given a warm glass of water. What was hilarious is they tried to make me stay for observation because I knew they wanted me to stay longer so they could rationalize charging me and arm and a fkn leg but I was like NOPE.  \n\nCan't imagine what they would have charged me had I stayed there for any amount of time.  \n\nHow this shit is legal is so beyond me.

Apparently at the time they could consider anything that happens in the first 6 months of active insurance a pre-existing condition if there was any previous lapse in insurance coverage.  I can assure you I didn't know my appendix was about to burst until it happened.  It took 2 or 3 jobs while I went to school....I paid it off several weeks before I was married at 28.

      "text": "My worst was a six figure plus bill for a pair of surgeries. The first was an emergency umbilical hernia repair\u2026 as was the second, less than 24 hours later. Why 2 surgeries? Well, after the first one, when I woke after surgery\u2026 not sure where I was or who transferred me to a room. But they decided that someone who just had abdominal surgery that using a wheelchair was a great idea. Not sure if anyone has ever heard or felt internal sutures fail, but it\u2019s a sound you never forget. I complained to the person to be told I was imagining things. Next day they had to go in and fix it, which put me in intensive care for about 4 days with a months long recovery.\n\nNever got an apology, never an explanation, and yes, it destroyed my finances. How you ask? Well, I made ~$25 too much income the month it happened to qualify for a county program which would have covered the whole episode. It was a program for low income workers\u2026 but the way they calculated income was creative to say the least. \n\nI was required to cash out my retirement account I had been donating into for about 2 years to make a payment to the hospital, as it was considered an asset, and was allowed to keep $2k of its value as cash. The rest went to the hospital even before I could be considered for the low income program.\n\nNever have recovered my financial losses, my credit, or the loss of any retirement funds at all\u2026\n\nViva \u2018Murrican business and health care.",

She's the only one who gets an income from the government while i'm still in the middle of trying to get mine. Either way the household income is just above the poverty line. We have no way to save money, if the car breaks we will never be able to get a new one etc. I told all that to say that my grandma cannot get back onto state health insurance because of a life insurance policy that would only just barely pay for cremation. So now she's stuck paying for an insurance that hardly covers enough for her to take full care of herself. Her needs aren't crazy by any means either. Yet she often has to pick and choose her health needs. Just thankful at least her meds are covered decently.",

And Hillary publicly opposed gay marriage many times in the past.\n\nSo we need to be mindful of how problems in this country are politicized and not spread misinformation and false narratives.",

Never heard of it?\n\nWell, since you're arguing out your arsed... \nA deductible is the amount you have to pay, out of pocket, until your health insurance will cover any medical expenses. Ours is $6300 a year for a family of 5. \n\nA premium is the amount you pay each and every month to keep enrolled in a healthcare plan, even if you don't use it right then. The cost varies widely, but $500-$1000 is about average. Some employers cover part of it, but not all.\n\nWhen my adult child turns 26 next month, they will lose our insurance and unless they want to pay $600/month for a health care plan through their full-time job, that won't cover anything until you've met their $3000 deductible, they'll be unable to access healthcare outside of an emergency. That emergency could then bankrupt them, because even an ambulance ride costs $800+ then there's hospital bills.",

You either lack critical thinking skills or are a malicious prick. You have already admitted to not understanding the basics of the American Healthcare system. Even with the self awareness that you don\u2019t fully understand the construct, you still feel comfortable arguing. SMH. \n\nps. US =/= UK healthcare systems. Using examples of the UK healthcare is meaningless in the US healthcare discussion. \n\npps. The reason private hospitals are better than public hospitals in the UK is that they have to compete with a medical provider that provide healthcare free of charge. If they didn\u2019t provide a better service, everyone would just go to the free medical provider. That system doesn\u2019t exist in the US. There are no free medical providers. You either pay or the medical provider doesn\u2019t have to do more than stabilize you.",

Total bill wasn't much more than the copay.\n\nWhen our daughter was born, she spent 5 weeks in the hospital.  During that time, she developed NEC and also had a Group B strep infection.  Plenty of surgeries.  Tons of specialists.  She beat all the odds and is now doing fine.\n\nHowever, nobody at the hospital told us that the NICU doctors were on strike and not taking any insurance.  I think we received a bill for about $2 million.  We fought with the hospital.  We were told we could have taken her to a different hospital, which was absurd.  Who takes a new born preemie that's fighting for her life to a different hospital.  That would probably fall under child endangerment.  Not to mention my wife had already been there for 3 months with no issues.\n\nLong story short, we fought the hospital for 6 months until we were tired of fighting.  Ended up agreeing to a $2,000 bill, paid in $50 monthly installments, interest free.  Every couple of months the hospital would call to see if we wanted to pay it off early.  We always refused.  \"But you are an engineer and your wife is a scientist.  Surely you could pay it off early.\"  \"Of course we can pay it off early.  But we won't.\"  We shouldn't have had to pay anything.",

I called insurance and they said it would be covered, but we had to pay the birth center up front (around $10k) and would be reimbursed by insurance after my daughter was born. We paid it expecting to be reimbursed. My wife went into labor and after about 12 hours the birth center gave up and sent us to the local hospital where she had a c-section. Shortly after her birth I got the bills together and sent them to insurance for processing. They denied the bill and flat out told us that if my wife would have given birth at the birth center they would have been covered, but since she was transferred to a hospital nothing from the birth center (midwife visits before birth, room, or any other procedures) would be covered or applied to our deductible.",

Hospital X is also my primary insurer - at this time they provided policies directly. My child was born at another hospital but it was entirely covered(!) because Hospital X does not provide OB services. I submit an online form to my employer (Hospital X) notifying them of my newborn's existence and to enroll them on my insurance - or so I thought. New baby goes to a clinic that is owned and operated by Hospital X for a well-child check. All is well.\n\nAbout 12 weeks go by and a letter from a collection agency appears demanding $600 for my well-child check. The letter was sent by Hospital X to a collection agency to acquire money from me, their employee, who is also insured by them, to remit payment to themselves. The bill was sent to collections because the e-statement was filtered by Hospital X's spam filter and I never got it. That enrollment form apparently only informed HR that I had a child and they neglected to tell me they did not enroll the kid on the insurance plan. Conveniently all occurring after the open enrollment period closed for a \"qualifying life event.\" The child was then uninsurable through my employer for the remainder of the calendar year and was therefore enrolled in a state Medicaid-funded Children's Health Insurance Program because as a resident with 2 children and a dependent spouse, I was below the 200% (maybe 300%) poverty threshold. You can't make this shit up.",

The hospital made it seem like it was MY fault for not knowing ahead of time what the gendor would be\u2026I didn\u2019t want to. Like\u2026.they had to prep a kit in case I had a boy??? And I asked when they normally did the procedure? After the birth but before the after birth? Why was the kit needed \u201con hand\u201d? Wtf was a \u201ckit\u201d for that matter? I had a girl so I wanted to know these things lmao. I clearly had no experience, being female and giving birth to a female. Apparently it\u2019s a sealed package of sterile tools used for the procedure and when done, these tools are sent off some where to be resterilized and repacked and then recharged to the next patient for the next use. Ok, so I get all that\u2026the process costs money\u2026.the kit was THOUSANDS!! For that cost I wanted my not-born son to have custom gold plates tools with his monogram and then I want to take these puppies home to mount them on the wall. The biller at the hospital was not amused. The insurance company was indifferent. One person said, \u201cdon\u2019t worry, your not responsible to pay this\u201d. By that point I knew I\u2019d never get my paid for circumcision kit to memorialize nor the charges removed. What a world.",

There, you can see a price list in the doctors offices for  specific services  and you will be charged. One, they are way less than you would pay here in the US. Secondly, they are comparable, and sometimes superior to what you receive here. It seems that politicians are in the pockets of insurance companies, therefore, any legislation you\u2019ll see is to benefit them, not you or I, unfortunately. Also, there is no money in cures, but billions to be made In Treatment; you can literally have a terminal disease and you will still have doctors come \u201ctreat\u201d the disease that they cannot fix. However, you\u2019re insurance is still good so they will have you come back to treat what they cannot fix!   Many people cross the border to get treatment because it seems that they get better results at a fraction of the price. And don\u2019t get me started on dental work in Mexico compared to the quality and price of the same services here in America. But hey, we\u2019re a first world country right and our politicians are working for you as well so they can\u2019t be lying, right?

You could have added the new born to your policy regardless of his/her passing and the bill would have been submitted to your insurance carrrier. However it is very likely $600 is below the deductible on your plan and so you probably would have owed some portion of it anyway plus at least one month of premium before you could remove the newborn from you policy. \n\nBeing able to add a dependent within 30 days of a qualifying event is basically law.

In this situation if the hospital is going to bill the child for services rendered to the child then you should add the child. However the charges may or may not meet your deductible and/or out of pocket so it may not make sense. If a child\nIs born and lots of effort/time is spent trying to keep the child alive you need to add the child even if it ultimately passes. If the child\nIs still born there is a good chance there is only minimal expenses and probably would waste time/money adding the still born child.",

The $600 is the charge for only the baby. The mother will receive separate bills from the hospital, the obstetrician who delivered the baby, maybe the anesthesiologist if she had an epidural and they are only contracted by the hospital, etc.",
