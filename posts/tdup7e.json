  "text": "TIFU by vomiting into a 92 year-old woman's vagina.\nI had just begun a new job working in memory care at a senior center. I was excited about the job. I love helping people. But, on the day I was supposed to start training.... I had a bit of a stomach 'thing' going on. But I didn't want to call off so early in my employment.... so I took a big slurp of Pepto Bismol and went in.\n\nThe first half of the shift went fine. And, though I was a still queasy, I was alright. I was learning how to help the residents with meals, recreation, and all their daily functions.\n\nMy manager told me it was time to learn how to help them with bathroom functions. And that one of the residents, a 92 year old woman named \"Georgia\" needed to be changed. I gulped, but was ready. The residents needed help with this, and I'd provide the help.\n\nMy manager brought me into Georgia's room. She was lying on her bed, awake and smiling. My manager said: \"Georgia, we're here to change you. \"\n\nGeorgia smiled and said: \"That's nice.\"\n\nManager said: \"I know you've not been feeling well, Georgia. is today any better?\"\n\nGeorgia smiled and said \"That's nice.\" My manager told me this is the only thing Georgia EVER said.\n\nMy boss lead me through the process of getting Georgia's pants off. The smell intensified. My stomach burbled. We opened Georgia's disposable adult undergarment.\n\nYeah. Georgia WAS NOT feeling well. Georgia had horible, volcanic diareahha. Georgia had messed herself. And the mess had creeped around to AND INTO her front.\n\nMy boss began the cleaning. Showing me how to gently clean the resident. She had me put my gloves on and told me I was to finish cleaning Georgia. At this point, my stomach was NOT doing well. But I was determined. The residents needed me.\n\nGloves on, wet wipes in hand. Cleaning Georgia's outsides was managable. I was queasy, but it was managable. Then my boss pointed out I was not done. That, some of the diareahha had gone into Georgia's vagina. And I would have to clean that out.\n\nI should mention at this point that I am a gay man. And that this was my very first experience with a vagina. And, while I'm totally vagina-positive... and not adversant.... I was not prepared to deal with a brown liquid filled vagina. Not when I was dealing with nausea.\n\nI vomited. I know I should have felt it coming and turned away. But I didn't. The vomit happened suddenly and withouyt warning. And it went onto and into her vagina.\n\nGeorgia just smiled and said:  \"That's nice.\"\n\nMy boss then said something for which I will always be grateful. Even though her lips were pursed and I could tell she was disgusted and upset, she only said: \"If you're vomiting, you need to go home. Now. I'll take care of this.\"\n\nI took off my gloves. I went home. I went back the next day and gifted my boss with a bunch of candy bars.\n\nEpilogue: I'm still working there. I've not vomited into any more vaginas.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr:  If you're sick, stay home.",

He missed he, but knew my grandmother was in a much better place.  He started calling me by my mother\u2019s name first, then he thought I was his older brother.  My mother\u2019s sister and I found out when he fell 18 months after my mother died and I got him to the ER that he also had prostate cancer.  The doctor told us he had told my grandfather, but we think he didn\u2019t say anything because he didn\u2019t want to upset my grandmother, but with his dementia, he forgot he had cancer.  By that time it had spread to his bones. We put him in a nursing home.  He ended up passing away a month after he was admitted. \nWatching someone so strong and capable of fixing anything be reduced to not recognizing anyone in his room immediate family was just horrible.",

Therefore, I wouldn't have been ideal to sit with him either. \n\nHe'd been depressed for years, & I guess it just got the best of him when he started thinking about having outside people *taking care of him*. For some reason, that just really bothered him. He had a bad knee that he refused to have fixed for this same reason. He couldn't stand to have anyone take care of him. \n\nHe waited until my brother went to work one morning, & he shot himself in the heart. My brother found him when he came home from work. \n\nMy dad was suffering, so part of me is happy he is no longer in that kind of pain. I know he's in a better place. The other side of me is pretty pissed at him, b/c, he left without even leaving a note. \n\nI'm not trying to change anyone's mind here but just think about your family when that time comes, is all I will say...

All were young (Under 50), & none of it was Covid Related. The combination of those deaths, & then my father's suicide just threw me for a loop. I'm maintaining tho. It's been a rough go.",

Many of my residents are what I like to call pleasantly confused, they\u2019re just happy to go along with whatever\u2019s happening and are generally happy.

They get easily frustrated and lash out at staff and other residents, usually just verbal but they can be combative from time to time. They\u2019re in pain and they can\u2019t understand why, and they\u2019re surrounded by people they don\u2019t know that are telling them what they should be doing.\n\nMy view of dementia is probably colored by the unit I\u2019ve worked in, where their condition has progressed to later stages and we\u2019re basically the last stop on the ride. We still do everything we can for them though, and despite the challenges of the pandemic we still provide them surprisingly nice facilities, rooms are clean and private, and the meals are actually really good. We have dedicated activities staff that helps to keep residents busy and not staring at walls, and most of the staff really cares about the residents.

Yes even in socialized medicine countries. Who do you think they buy medicine from? Who do you think all those tax dollars earmarked for medical research are being spent by? Nobody invests in curing diseases. The invest in treating them because a patient you cure is a single transaction and a patient you treat is a life long customer.\n\nThe fact is we have fantastic treatments for a variety of human maladies we simply consider normal or short term non-lethal that you only get access to if you have a shitload of money. Like NOW. RIGHT NOW. If you have 5 million dollars to blow you can fix problems that until this point you just learned to live with like your hair loss, or that mole, or skin discoloration, or your tooth that isn't quite right, or how hard you found it to lose weight or gain muscle, or your chronic digestive condition, chronic low level pain, sexual dysfunction, or in many cases lifelong bone, neurological, or cardiovascular issue.\n\nWhat's important to consider when talking about modern medicine is to realize that, in general terms, we have the \"hardware\" to do massive and effectively permanent gene-level editing on any given living organism very cheaply and efficiently already. Fixing most of these problems is at this point a \"software\" problem of understanding the specific effect of genes we edit and certifying those edits as safe and many of the barriers are funding treatments that would constitute cures for conditions that are more profitable to simply treat the symptoms of.\n\nOnly in this case there is a vocal and thousands of years old philosophical and pseudo-moral argument that aging is \"the natural order\" or that we risk \"overpopulation\" or whatever that is weaponized for political capital the same way \\*insert the dumbest thing one end of the horseshoe says about the other end\\* is.\n\nIf someone can just convince enough rich people that people being healthy enough to work for peanuts for 100 more years means they buy products and provide cheap labor for 100 years this talking point probably vanishes faster than the moral panic about gay marriage did.",

Well he got it, was in the icu for 6 weeks and in rehab for 8 weeks. He now has full blown dementia, it's been like this for 2 years now. I used to have my brother and sister to help take care of him but they have since bailed and I'm taking care of him all by myself. \n\n\n\nIt's interesting because he really wanted to live right after it happened, but now he is just a husk of a human being. He soils himself all the time and fights me angrily every single time I say we need to change his diapers or give him a shower. He is exactly like a mentally handicapped 4 year old. Screaming at me that he is clean even if there is poop just sloshing all around and he will just stick his hand in there and wipe it all around, try to shove it under his blankets and in his desk drawers and then say he is fine. It's awful, and I ha e a very weak gag reflex I almost puke every time. But it's just an absolute miserable existence, but in his mind everyone else has gone crazy and he is the only sane person left. \n\n\n\nYou are stuck in a place where you have to take care of them, and they are left humiliated all the time and confused and combative but you can't actually do anything about it except to continue to give the best care you possibly can",

My mother had two dementia tests a few years apart, failed both and her CT scan showed she had what's called Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus. If caught early, the patient can get a shunt and live a good long and healthy life. It was too late for my mom.

The pure fear and panic I saw on both their faces on countless occasions was enough to convince me that living with dementia is a terrifying and confusing ordeal for the sufferer.\n\nAlso, having dementia isn\u2019t just suddenly becoming oblivious. It\u2019s a slow deterioration over years. You start forgetting things bit by bit. My grandpa refused to accept his diagnosis until the day he died, but my grandmother absolutely knew something was wrong with her. It was extremely hard on her. She would sob because she couldn\u2019t say the right word or remember any of our names. There was a lot of frustration in the early years because she would leave to go somewhere familiar and get horribly lost for hours. Right before her diagnosis, she left to pick me up from school at 2pm and my family didn\u2019t see or hear from her until 9pm that night. This was before cell phones, so it was a nightmare. A few years later when I moved in to be her caretaker, there were times she thought I was a burglar trying to attack her in her home, and another time she thought I was a doctor poisoning her. You don\u2019t just sit around, smiling and staring into space all the time, though sometimes she did that. Even with end stage dementia, you have periods of panic and fear despite being nonverbal and unable to communicate what\u2019s happening to the people around you. This is not how you want to spend your final time on this planet tbh.",

As to feces, it's just a question of learning a new kink. ;)  \n  \nBeing more serious, though, there is a tendency, particularly in men, to see their own value only in terms of their ability to be a competent provider. Which is why there is a spike in suicide rates in the year or two after retirement. I believe we can and should see value in ourselves beyond that, and that we have intrinsic worth even when we are not a provider. Arguably, even when we become a burden. I believe we can find an inner peace which goes beyond the purely physical. To what extent that is still true during cognitive decline is an open question to me. Perhaps one day I'll know the answer.",

I mean I wish my dad had at least a tiny bit of Georgia's courtesy, instead he fights me every step of the way when it comes to any rules or cleaning. He pulls every single thing out of the fridge and freezer every single 30 minutes and he always finds the keys to the locks and throws them away and then eats so much he soils himself all over then spreads it all over the house and then yells at me that I'm crazy for telling him he needs a shower. It's such a struggle to ever get him to shower in any way shape or form",

Many of whom were 14.  Sick policy was that if you called out sick, it was unpaid, and you needed to find someone to cover for you. \n\nThe CNRAs(like OP) were paid $12/hr. This was 2008 in a HCOL area. I don't know their sick policy but I do know that many of the employees were irresponsible party type teenagers-twenties and needed money. I know this because many of them were former restaurant employees who thought that the $4 pay bump for doing the semester long CNA certification at community college was the best deal ever. \n\nAnywho since that was my experience at a \"top\" facility...and why it's not surprising that Nursing Homes are often the first places to have outbreaks. Until the people at the top are held accountable, it's not going to change. For the amount of money they rake in, it truly would be trivial to encourage liberal use of leave. But the cynical side of me thinks this is working as intended... Since by the time seniors are in nursing they are running low on assets and the facility will be able to free up a new spot (mine had a deal where you buy a room in retirement community and see always gaurenteed to be taken care of, die before 7 years family can sell room, die after 7 and ownership reverts completely back to facility). \n\nSo yeah... I definitely decided I would prefer an early death over going into one. My grandpa is a smart man and decided the same. He is living alone at 93 and not going to drag it out if he gets another heart attack or stroke.",

Would you?\n\nCognitive decline is not always like you wake up on morning on the verge of being a vegetable.  It can be very, very gradual, and it's not an all-day everyday thing either. It's just tiny moments or blips of uncertainty/slowness.  Are you going to do it when it's one blip a month?  2 blips?  3?  \n\nHow will you know that it wasn't just an off-day?  How will you differentiate between losing your cognitive function and just having a brain fart?  Because you said AS SOON AS it started to go.\n\nA slow decline is also normal, and doesn't mean you're going to be a burden.  My grandpa repeated himself a lot towards the end, but he lived to his late 80s and lived in his own house the entire time.

My great-grandfather lived by himself until 98 (only dying 3 years ago). He was a really good man and even though his wife died 16 years ago, he successfully lived by himself and continued playing chess, building houses, traveling and just living life happily until his final days. Ideally, I hope that I can live like that in my twilight years.\n\nHowever, if I can't live without either a) being miserable in a retirement/elder care home or b) burden my family (and their children/partners) with my maintenance, then it's time to go.\n\n> Hope your kids forgive you someday when they learn that you offed yourself at, again, the FIRST SIGN of cognitive decline.\n\nImagine blaming someone for killing themselves. That's pretty fucked. And we've all seen people that grow progressively more unhappy as their elders decline more and more over time. I don't want to be a burden.\n\ntldr - Your mind is the only thing you truly own. I refuse to live without mine.",

              "text": "Here's the thing about that. I don't know where you are, but where I am it's not necessarily a \"poor working conditions\" thing to go to work symptomatic as it is a cultural thing.  \n  \nIf you don't have a fever and are not actively vomiting or have diarrhea, you are expected to go to work or school. This standard starts in childhood and continues your entire life. If you have a headache, a cough, nausea, or fatigue as a stand-alone symptom, you are expected to suck it up and work or go to school. If you stay home for only one of those symptoms, there's not only social stigma but disapproval from authority figures.\n  \nI was once sent to school with strep throat. I did not feel well, and told my parents so, but I was not vomiting or having a fever. I wasn't nauseous. I just didn't feel well. That is not a good enough reason to stay home. That day did not end up going well. \n  \nThat's kind of the unspoken rule where I live. If you're not vomiting or having a fever, you suck it up and go to school or work. Take ibuprofen or pepto bismol. It's not sickness if you're still able to participate. It's enforced by both parents, employers, and peers as a general attitude.   \n  \nSo firstly, I always feel that criticizing someone's actions in retrospect on the internet is in bad taste, but also for this person, they probably thought it was irresponsible to stay home.  \n  \nDo I agree with all this? No. Has this been the deal and general behavior for everyone I know my whole life? Yes. Do I think you should stay home to protect the vulnerable? Yes. I have done this in a past, similar job. Did my bosses and work colleagues appreciate having to cover my shifts when I could still have worked but just didn't feel well? No, they didn't. They would have gone to work in my situation, as has my current boss and most other people that I know.",

They also have to make money. As irresponsible as it is, their options are also limited and people will usually put their family over someone else. \n\nThe best way to avoid this at alot of places is to have an actual functioning sick policy so your employees aren't scared about calling in sick-- and also aren't so miserable at their jobs that they abuse that system. I think the employees who spend the most amount of time in direct care are usually treated the worst at facilities and then people wonder why they have high turnover. \n\nIf workers are coming in sick I don't judge the worker. I judge the employer who put them in a position to think that's their only real option.",

And everyone else had to pick up the slack because these places are chronically understaffed. At my current facility, if you call in sick, you are forcing a coworker from the previous shift to work 16 hours, as they have to cover your shift too. \n\nAmerica sucks sometimes.\n\nETA: sorry about your bad experience, OP.

One morning I came in for my 12 hour shift and my stomach wasn't sitting right. I figured it was because I had coffee and still showed up. Well 4 hours into my shift and I'm just feeling worse. I had to go bring a lady out for lunch and when I walked into her room there was poop everywhere. She had an accident and then started walking in it. It was all over her, on the walls, on the sink and floor. I called my coworker to help me clean it up but the second time I walked in there I couldn't handle it. I apologized to her and ran to the staff bathroom and started puking. I went home early and ended up on the couch for 3 days with a fever and vomiting. So yes, please stay home if you're sick",

I should have stayed home.   --- That's why I posted this in \"Today I fucked up.\"   When someone doesn't feel well, they should stay home.  Nobody wants to get other people,k especially vulnerable people, sick.  I fucked up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nand also\n\n2) Humans have a hard time knowing when they'rew 'sick'.Sometimes I get stomach aches.   Is that an illness?  Or Taco Bell?  And also... Honestly, I've never called off for any job where I waasn't asked about my symptoms in detail to see if OI wasn't \"sick enough\".  Very few places staff at a level where a call off doesn't affect everyone.  Even places (like a senior center) that should.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was in the wrong.  That's why I posted in this subreddit.  I get that.  I accept my cupability. Try not to come down on me too hard.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAddendum: This was before covid.  Which is why I wasn't masked.",

              "text": "I think it\u2019s back now, but just in case here\u2019s what OP wrote:\n\n\u201cI had just begun a new job working in memory care at a senior center. I was excited about the job. I love helping people. But, on the day I was supposed to start training.... I had a bit of a stomach 'thing' going on. But I didn't want to call off so early in my employment.... so I took a big slurp of Pepto Bismol and went in.\n\nThe first half of the shift went fine. And, though I was a still queasy, I was alright. I was learning how to help the residents with meals, recreation, and all their daily functions.\n\nMy manager told me it was time to learn how to help them with bathroom functions. And that one of the residents, a 92 year old woman named \"Georgia\" needed to be changed. I gulped, but was ready. The residents needed help with this, and I'd provide the help.\n\nMy manager brought me into Georgia's room. She was lying on her bed, awake and smiling. My manager said: \"Georgia, we're here to change you. \"\n\nGeorgia smiled and said: \"That's nice.\"\n\nManager said: \"I know you've not been feeling well, Georgia. is today any better?\"\n\nGeorgia smiled and said \"That's nice.\" My manager told me this is the only thing Georgia EVER said.\n\nMy boss lead me through the process of getting Georgia's pants off. The smell intensified. My stomach burbled. We opened Georgia's disposable adult undergarment.\n\nYeah. Georgia WAS NOT feeling well. Georgia had horible, volcanic diareahha. Georgia had messed herself. And the mess had creeped around to AND INTO her front.\n\nMy boss began the cleaning. Showing me how to gently clean the resident. She had me put my gloves on and told me I was to finish cleaning Georgia. At this point, my stomach was NOT doing well. But I was determined. The residents needed me.\n\nGloves on, wet wipes in hand. Cleaning Georgia's outsides was managable. I was queasy, but it was managable. Then my boss pointed out I was not done. That, some of the diareahha had gone into Georgia's vagina. And I would have to clean that out.\n\nI should mention at this point that I am a gay man. And that this was my very first experience with a vagina. And, while I'm totally vagina-positive... and not adversant.... I was not prepared to deal with a brown liquid filled vagina. Not when I was dealing with nausea.\n\nI vomited. I know I should have felt it coming and turned away. But I didn't. The vomit happened suddenly and withouyt warning. And it went onto and into her vagina.\n\nGeorgia just smiled and said: \"That's nice.\"\n\nMy boss then said something for which I will always be grateful. Even though her lips were pursed and I could tell she was disgusted and upset, she only said: \"If you're vomiting, you need to go home. Now. I'll take care of this.\"\n\nI took off my gloves. I went home. I went back the next day and gifted my boss with a bunch of candy bars.\n\nEpilogue: I'm still working there. I've not vomited into any more vaginas.\n\n\u200b\n\ntl;dr: If you're sick, stay home.\u201d",

I've found one brand that I've liked out of 4-5 that I've tried... all the others smell chemically and generally unpleasant. [Link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07P26SG92/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1). I promise I'm not a shill for big wintergreen.\n\nI'll put a TINY drop on my finger to transfer under my nose. A 10 mL bottle generally lasts me 2-3 years. This stuff is VERY strong, but as a nurse I deal with less frequent.... smells than an assistant. You'll smell very strongly of an Altoid for an hour or two, but you won't be throwing up in any vaginas. It is so strong you literally cannot smell anything else for ages. Some colleagues find it overwhelming. I like it. I learned this trick from an episode of ER (or maybe it was House MD) where there was a surgical case with necrotizing fasciitis. Works a treat. I actually had a patient with perineal necrotizing fasciitis a few years ago, which was thoroughly horrifying. Nearly rotted his balls off. His wound vac kept coming off daily, so we had to do changes daily, which is not standard, and we couldn't figure out why until my colleague discovered him polishing his knob with Vaseline. We took away the Vaseline and voila! He got better. People are gross.\n\nWarning: For some people, the strong smell of wintergreen can make them NEED to pee IMMEDIATELY, so keep that in mind. \n\nAdditional warning: Pepto can... back you up. It is not good for nausea. It will cause a block at the back end, and then there's nowhere to go but up. Better off with staying home.",

          "text": "TIFU by vomiting into a 92 year-old woman\u2019s vagina.\n\nI had just begun a new job working in memory care at a senior center. I was excited about the job. I love helping people. But, on the day I was supposed to start training\u2026. I had a bit of a stomach \u2018thing\u2019 going on. But I didn\u2019t want to call off so early in my employment\u2026. so I took a big slurp of Pepto Bismol and went in.\n\nThe first half of the shift went fine. And, though I was a still queasy, I was alright. I was learning how to help the residents with meals, recreation, and all their daily functions.\n\nMy manager told me it was time to learn how to help them with bathroom functions. And that one of the residents, a 92 year old woman named \u201cGeorgia\u201d needed to be changed. I gulped, but was ready. The residents needed help with this, and I\u2019d provide the help.\n\nMy manager brought me into Georgia\u2019s room. She was lying on her bed, awake and smiling. My manager said: \u201cGeorgia, we\u2019re here to change you. \u201c\n\nGeorgia smiled and said: \u201cThat\u2019s nice.\u201d\n\nManager said: \u201cI know you\u2019ve not been feeling well, Georgia. is today any better?\u201d\n\nGeorgia smiled and said \u201cThat\u2019s nice.\u201d My manager told me this is the only thing Georgia EVER said.\n\nMy boss lead me through the process of getting Georgia\u2019s pants off. The smell intensified. My stomach burbled. We opened Georgia\u2019s disposable adult undergarment.\n\nYeah. Georgia WAS NOT feeling well. Georgia had horible, volcanic diareahha. Georgia had messed herself. And the mess had creeped around to AND INTO her front.\n\nMy boss began the cleaning. Showing me how to gently clean the resident. She had me put my gloves on and told me I was to finish cleaning Georgia. At this point, my stomach was NOT doing well. But I was determined. The residents needed me.\n\nGloves on, wet wipes in hand. Cleaning Georgia\u2019s outsides was managable. I was queasy, but it was managable. Then my boss pointed out I was not done. That, some of the diareahha had gone into Georgia\u2019s vagina. And I would have to clean that out.\n\nI should mention at this point that I am a gay man. And that this was my very first experience with a vagina. And, while I\u2019m totally vagina-positive\u2026 and not adversant\u2026. I was not prepared to deal with a brown liquid filled vagina. Not when I was dealing with nausea.\n\nI vomited. I know I should have felt it coming and turned away. But I didn\u2019t. The vomit happened suddenly and withouyt warning. And it went onto and into her vagina.\n\nGeorgia just smiled and said:  \u201cThat\u2019s nice.\u201d\n\nMy boss then said something for which I will always be grateful. Even though her lips were pursed and I could tell she was disgusted and upset, she only said: \u201cIf you\u2019re vomiting, you need to go home. Now. I\u2019ll take care of this.\u201d\n\nI took off my gloves. I went home. I went back the next day and gifted my boss with a bunch of candy bars.\n\nEpilogue: I\u2019m still working there. I\u2019ve not vomited into any more vaginas.\n\n\u200b\n\ntl;dr:  If you\u2019re sick, stay home.",

Stewardess was Laotian and she and started flirting so we went back in to the rear cabin and slipped in to the bathroom. Mile high club, you know? Well, I was performing oral on her while she was on the sink spread eagle and I noticed that the last person didn't flush the toilet. I just puked right in her vagina and she said \"that's nice\".\n\nAnother time I was in rural Alabama. I had recently purchased a pick up truck in Florida for about 1000 dollars and was driving westward. Out of a prank, my friends painted \"Man Love Rules\" in pink on the side of my truck. We stopped to get gas and while I was giving my friend a jump in his caddy this big fat woman came rambling out of the station asking if we are gay and want to get beaten up. Well, that did it. My friend held her down in the back of the pick up and I started to pleasure her orally. Then, in the bright sun, clear sky, I vomited right in her vagina and she said \"that's nice\". \n\nBack when I was heavily in to using meth, I was walking to my car in an alley way and a heroin addict woman jumped out of the trash can. She said something to the effect \"I'm really sick, I'll suck your dick for dollars, I need a fix\". So I figured why not get serious? I told her I'd pay her five dollars to get but naked and sit on the dumpster. I got close to the garbage and that nasty beaver and you know what? I vomited right in her vagina and she said \"that's nice\". \n\nOne time I was buying lottery tickets, those scratch of kinds you know? Wow, I won $1 million. I'm already a millionaire so I figured I could give this to some loser. So what better place than Walmart? I go into Walmart and I see this fat loser with his family and I walk up to him and said \"would you like this million dollar lottery ticket\". Dude starts all crying and thanking me but ten I tear up the lottery ticket in front of him. He starts cussing at me and threatening to fight. Well, that did it. I turned away walked several steps. He took a swing at me so I round house kicked him to the chest. His fat wife was coming at me so I took out my knife and said \"Watch out for falling prices\" and threw the knife at a sign above her head and it crashed in to her skull. He moo moo was hiked up so you know what? I vomited in her vagina and she said \"that's nice\".",

          "text": "I don't know why you're getting downvoted, these are all plausible stories and I believe them without question 100%. Reminds me of something similar that happened to me a few years back:\n\nWell where I live I have the nickname of Handsome Mclargehuge, and I've had intercourse with every single woman who lives here. So that's roughly 14,000 women. Somebody new recently moved here and turns out she's a top Hollywood actress (I won't reveal her name), when word got round to her about my nickname I guess she instantly wanted to meet me so I was like yeah, OK.\n\nSo I was sitting on my couch in my 15 bedroom house when I heard a knock on the door, I opened it and there she was, sitting on the porch with her legs wide open inviting me in. I wasted no time and immediately began performing oral on her vagina. While I was doing it I began thinking about my extremely high IQ, huge penis and generally what an impressive speciman of a heterosexual man I was. I was overwhelmed with my humbleness and vomited fully into her vagina, her muscles contracted and she shot it all back into my mouth then I vomited it back into her again, her only response was \"that's nice\".",

I prefer a swift round-house kick to the neck to demobilize and a survival knife through the gut. One day I was out on the tundra and I ran in to a group of eskimo's clubbing seals to death. Well, that did it. I gave each one of the men a swift round-house kick to the chest but then I noticed one was a woman so I used what I call \"The Cosette Special\" right to groin. Her clothes shattered in to tiny frozen pieces so I held her above my head, spinning her in a circle ,and vomited straight upward and she said 'that's nice', in English strangely.\n\nThe movie *Full Metal Jacket* is actually based on my life, but they got it wrong. See, you must remember the line \"Make me so horny\" and \"sucky sucky\", right? It's not correct. See, I was on a day's rest in a village outside Denang and this hooker comes up to me and starts saying 'pukey pukey' over and over again with her finger in her throat, 'pukey pukey, ten dolla'. So I paid her five, took her out in to a rice paddy, and vomited in her vagina and she said 'that's nice'. \n\nDo you guys remember the all-girl band Vixen? From the 1980s? Remember the song they had \"Edge of a Broken Heart\". That song is actually called \"Edge of a Broken Fart\". See, I had all four of them their changing room behind stage at the Meadow Lands in 1984. See, I wouldn't normally do this, but I drank a quart of castor oil, had all the girls line up doggy style and vomited in to each of their vaginas and they all said in unison 'that's nice'.",

I walked into the toughest bar I could find and demanded an alcoholic beverage. A group of guys came up behind me and said to me \"who the hell do you think you are?\" Well, that did it. \"Cool it cats\" I said, remember this was the 70's, it must've been the look in my eyes because they packed up and got the hell out of Dodge. A woman at the very end of the bar ( a good 15 metres away) squatted down, took of her underwear and opened her legs.\nThis was my invitation, I thought with a smirk, I used my high IQ to calculate the trajectory and projectile vomited right into her vagina. \"That's nice\" she said.",

I went over there and the door was unlocked so I went right in. Sure enough there was my neighbor and two of her friends smoking their hearts content. I them they have two options: 1, you girls can put the points out or 2, I will put joints for you. My neighbor had runs ins with me before so she knew I meant business so she threw her joint down and told me to leave. I said \"That's a wise choice but I'm calling the cops\" and turned to leave. My neighbor then got off the couch behind me, said a few cuss words and told me to mind my business. Well, that did it. I turned around, took off my shades, looked straight in the eye and said \"Let's get high\". I then kicked her a good 8 feet in the air. Then her other friend came at me with the bong. I grabbed her arm, snapped and hit her in the stomach with the bong. Then her other friend ran in to to kitchen so I went after her. She was in the corner crying so I said \"This is your brain\" and then grabbed a frying pan and said \"This is your brain on drugs\" and then I hit her in the head as hard as could with the frying pan. After that, to show I mean business, I took off my shades, lowered frying pan ladies pants and vomited in her vagina and she said 'that's nice'. Then I took turns vomiting in the other girls' vaginas, to which they responded 'that's nice'.\n\nAfter that I called the cops and they came over and arrested my vomit strewn neighbor and her friends. As I was leaving the Sarge shouted out to me \"that's not nice\". Well, that did it. I turned around, took off my shades, looked her straight in the eye and said \"Well, you know Sarge, perhaps if we build a freaking Dunkin Doughnuts on this street it would give you guys an excuse to ride up here once or twice a week to keep the crime down.\"  I threw my shades on the ground to let her know I meant business and then vomited in her vagina. I feel pretty good about what I did for the community, and I looked good doing it.",

I sat there contemplating the kind of stuff that only super high IQ people like me contemplate when they came over to me. This was their first mistake. One leaned close and whispered to me \"Give us the manuscript or we kill everyone on board\". These were no ordinary street thugs, and they knew who I was and what I could do.\n\nMy penis had gone numb because I had been sitting on it.\n\n\"They only sent five of you?\" I quipped. As I went to stand up one of them shot a .45 into my face, remembering my training, I caught the bullet between my teeth and spat it back at him, the round hit him between the eyes, splattering brain matter and bone fragments all over his accomplices. Needless to say they backed down and left the bus. With the manuscript still safe in my hands and my would be assassins defeated, I sat down cool as a cucumber while I received a round of applause from the other passengers.\n\nThe bus driver came over to me and as a show of respect allowed me to perform cunnilingus on her vagina. (She looked exactly like 80's Michelle phifer). So I did, as I was pleasuring her she explained to me she had a medical condition which meant she has never once washed herself down there, well, that did it. I vomited blood violently into her opening and all she had to say was \"that's nice\".\n\nI wiped my mouth and got off the bus at my stop. A mysterious, particularly well endowed, handsome and enigmatic stranger in a world with no heart, I walked off once again into the dark unforgiving night.",

I don't smoke and most of the time I sit in the non smoking section but I didn't feel like walking to the back of the restaurant this time so me and my friend sat at the first table we came to in the smoking section. Since most people should be aware that I don't smoke I didn't think I would have any problems. I was wrong. This bitch lit up a cigarette right next to me. I couldn't believe this fat bitch was disrespecting me like this so I turned around and looked her right in the eye and said \"You might want to put that out Ma'am....That is, if you value your health\". The woman said a couple of cuss words and told me to go to the non smoking section. Well, that did it. I got up went over to the table and said \"Excuse me Ma'am but you didn't clean your plate\", and then I took her plate and bashed her over the head with it. Then her friend that was with her got up and took a swing at me, I ducked it and then gave her a swift round kick to the ribs. I then hip tossed her on the table and then I turned around and looked one of the waiters right in the eye and said \"This order's to go\" and then I tossed the table with the woman on it a good 14 feet across the room which caused her mini dress to go flying off, so I walked over to her drinking my flask of castor oil, vomited in her vagina and she said \"that's nice\".\n\nAs me and my friend were storming out the manager apologized to us but I told him it was too late as I would never vomit in vagina there again and he said \"that's nice\".",

He nodded at me and gave me his wedding ring, \"keep this, go to my home and show her what a real man looks like\" and I did just that.\n\nShe was a little on the kinky side, having duct taped my face to her vagina so that I could hardly breathe. \"Renee Zellweger!

All the moisture eventually caused me to dislodge and a waterfall of puke just flowed out of her gaping vag and swept me right out the door.

Unless someone else wasn't doing their job properly, this amount of a mess shouldn't have been missed. That means she had an awful amount within less than 2 hours, was laying in it, and it was likely continuous. Adult diapers are only so effective and at a certain point the diarrhea just didn't have anywhere else to go. If it was leaky/continuous, that would have caused a bit of pressure plus the fact that she was laying down on top of it all.\n\nTo answer your question, a lot of times our vaginas can get a small amount of water inside, especially if you're going down a water slide because of the pressure. Generally speaking however, your labia majora and minora should protect you from that, but if you relax or use your muscles while in the bath, you'll get some water in. That being said, there are a few things you should know about vaginal anatomy and aging:\n\nFor an elderly patient like the one in this story, it's far more likely that during aging the pelvic floor muscles weakened and the loss of collagen and fat in the area (caused by a decrease in estrogen levels) became thinner. This makes the vaginal opening less protected, not the other way around like you initially assumed.",

I've been in this field for years and you're right, they wouldn't be left alone. That's why they weren't. \n\nNowhere in the post did OP write that. In fact, it's very clear that they were reprimanded right after it happened and that the manager took over because they were *watching* them perform. \n\nOP also clarified in another comment that they were mixing up the terms vulva and vagina, which is unfortunately common (yes, even for people in the field). So I'd give you that point but it could also very well be the case that that sentence can't be taken clinically. \n\nYou can't argue about the believability of the story when you don't even have enough reading comprehension to understand the sequence of events in the first place. My God I stand by my statement whether it's true or not, people like you are ignorant and don't believe anything ever happens.",

I remember when I first started training my older sister who'd been in the job already told me to take a big whiff and get used to it when I spoke about being nervous about smelling rancid shit all day. Obviously that wouldn't have been good advice on a sick stomach. I nearly puked myself the first time I did perineal care. You got this! It's an awesome, rewarding, back-breaking, difficult job. I have so many positive memories over my time in nursing homes with the residents. They were most of them very sweet and wonderful people. \nMy advice is to always approach them with dignity and respect, no matter what you've heard about their behavior. You're a guest in their home, caring for them. I can't tell you how many CNAs would tell me that so and so is a grumpy asshole and always gives them trouble, but I never had an issue with. If you come in with a nasty attitude, they'll match it. But if you come in with a kind and loving attitude, 9 times out of 10 they'll match that too. And the 10% that don't probably can't help it and still deserve love and respect. \n\nI'm rambling, but I'll leave a story that is similar. I was working night shift, and a call bell went off. I walked into the room, and asked what was wrong. She said \"Help me, I'm broken,\" and then projectile vomited black bile all over her bed and the floor past it. Coffee grounds looking bile. We ended up sending her to the hospital, because it was probably a small bowel blockage, but I'll always remember how I very nearly added my own vomit to that horror movie projectile vomit disaster.",

I would pick him up (physically lift him out of his wheelchair into my front seat) in my truck and take him to museums, theme parks, movies, things like that. It paid well, and I wasn\u2019t required to deal with any *accidents.* He and I are actually the same age, although mentally, I\u2019d say he\u2019s around 12 years old. \n\nThis may be a good time to note, I cannot deal with bad smells.  I have thrown up because of someone else\u2019s fart before. My stomach is so sensitive that I can throw up on command. \n\nAnyway, one day, we\u2019re leaving a fire truck museum. I had put him in the passenger seat and was finishing up getting his wheelchair into the trunk. I walked around to the driver\u2019s side, get in, and he turns to me and says, \u201cAnon, I had an accident. I think it\u2019s a bad one.\u201d \n\nAll the blood left my face. We were sitting in my hot truck in the Phoenix summer heat; then the smell hit me. Oh. My. God. \n\nOf course, I didn\u2019t shame him or do anything of the sort, I just said, \u201cOk Chris, we\u2019ll get you home and taken care of. No big deal.\u201d (His name is not Chris.)\n\nI hauled ass back to his family\u2019s home, about a 30 minute drive, with all the windows down in 110 degree heat, trying not to puke out the window. \n\nWe get home, I call his other helper, the woman who would normally handle this sort of thing. She was in the middle of a family emergency. Obviously, I couldn\u2019t leave Chris with a diaper full of poop, so I did it. He was right. It was a bad one. *Very* close to diarrhea consistency. \n\nIt felt strange to wipe an adult\u2019s ass, especially one my age. The only butt I\u2019d ever wiped, until that point, was my own. I cleaned him as best I could, stepping out of the room periodically to breathe poopless air. \n\nHis mom got home shortly thereafter, I let her know what happened, and that he may need some additional cleaning as I was unsure of my ass-wiping prowess. \n\nThen I left, and I thought I was in the clear. All good, things happen, I handled it, and I\u2019m probably a better man for it. \n\nNOPE. The poop/smell soaked through his diaper, clothes, and right into my cloth seat. No amount of cleaning chemicals would get rid of it, until it eventually faded about 6 months later. I\u2019ll never forget the stench. I had to drive with my windows down for the entirety of that summer. Every time I\u2019d get back into the car leaving a store or something, the (black) car would\u2019ve soaked up all that heat from the sun, and the stench would return, intensely. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s a lesson to be learned somewhere in there, but it was an experience that I will absolutely never forget.",

I did get a write up for that, thankfully I no longer work there where your own bodily functions are punished. \n\nTry keeping some vicks or peppermint oil in your pocket to put in your nostrils or mask before messy jobs, it really takes the sting out of the more aggressive smells.

New linens and clothing needed...and I've literally helped residents shit by pushing on their asshole to help them birth their 4 pound brick of shit.... None of it phases me anymore.... Just wait till you smell c.diff and lactulose shit! You'll never. Ever. EVER. Forget it.... Just remember the moment you get home, strip off your scrubs and immediately shower. Don't touch anything. Don't sit on anything. Dont kiss or hug anyone or any animal. Because you don't know what's on them...never question what's on your scrubs because you probably don't want to know....as far as cleaning females, 1 wipe for down the sides of the vagina. A few for down the middle (you don't have to actively stare at what you're cleaning, just keep going down the center between the lips until it's clean... Sometimes it's easier to roll them, clean up the back and bottom, and then when you roll them back clean up the front more to make sure you didn't miss anything... And barrier cream. So much barrier cream.... On bad days, a bit of Vicks in your nostril can go miles :)",

I basically couldn't move at all or I'd shit myself it was fucking awful. I only forgave her cuz she was cute and was nice to me",
