It is wonderful to fuck a farting woman when every fuck drives one out of her. I think I would know Nora\u2019s fart anywhere. I think I could pick hers out in a roomful of farting women. It is a rather girlish noise not like the wet windy fart which I imagine fat wives have. It is sudden and dry and dirty like what a bold girl would let off in fun in a school dormitory at night. I hope Nora will let off no end of her farts in my face so that I may know their smell also.\n\n[Source.](https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2018/02/02/james-joyces-love-letters-dirty-little-fuckbird/) Fair warning: there's so much, much more.",

That just triggered a story I really wished I'd forgetten and now I'm sharing it with all of you so you can suffer, too.\n\nLate dictator and all-around creepy guy Muammar Qaddafi had a big crush on former Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice. He'd call her things like, \"My African princess,\" had Libyan musicians write songs about her with titles like, \"Black Flower in the White House, and he'd even ask other visiting dignitaries from foreign countries if they knew her and could they please convince her to come visit him?\n\nApparently, she had visited him once on official state business, but for some strange reason, she never wanted to return.\n\nAfter he was killed, some soldiers found scrapbooks full of different photos of Condoleezza Rice, often with accompanying poems Qaddafi had written, praising her beauty and expressing his undying love.\n\nUnfortunately, not every page could be seen and admired because quite a few of them were, uh, well, quite a few of the pages were stuck together.",

I like to shower daily, but I could swear getting too close to them for long enough, their bacteria floats through the air in clouds and settles on you and starts growing. I have put a spray bottle of bleach in the shower, you have to wash bleach off immediately  with soap, but I found you don't stink for days after, unless you have to be around them again. I can see how they had sniffer sensors on helicopters to detect people in Vietnam, humans give off clouds of stench and bacteria if they don't bathe. Also, think of the chair they sit on after not bathing for weeks, or their butt crack never, it must be covered in sweaty feces that leaked through their skid marked underwear.",

Up until probably the 80's, if you went to a rural community you wouldn't be too surprised to use an outhouse. And usually they would have to clean that out themselves, nobody was coming around to do it for you.\n\nBut, by the 50's I'd say that just about most if not almost all areas that wouldn't be considered rural (suburbs, cities, large towns, ect.) would have had sit down toilets.\n\nThe USA is HUGE, so the spread of stuff can take a while and the wealth gap is so large that the poor are living in a different country than the middle class and rich are. \n\nMy friend's mom grew up with an outhouse in the 70's in Colorado. My dad's family had a relative in Maine, they also had an outhouse. Both of my parents, from New Jersey, had full bathrooms and would have found it very weird to use an outhouse.\n\nAny newly built houses in the last few decades are gonna have a regular bathroom, unless you can't connect to a sewer system because you're too far out into nowhere.

I did use it a few times and was like, hmm, they\u2019re onto something.\n\nA few months later had a nice dinner in an upscale Japanese restaurant and used the bathroom. The toilet was more interesting than the food.

You think tampons is what the modern women wear, no. I almost forget about my period with a diva cup, I even cramp less. You can wear them for 12 hours without changing them. It's even better than it sounds in real life.  \nYou should watch at least this video before use though: \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMziA2Y2iqg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMziA2Y2iqg)\n\n  \nAlso, diva cups is just what I call them but there are actually many brands now. I use Salt because it's really soft and comfortable. If you don't wear one over night I recommend taking like a half bath after putting it in because they don't dry you out like tampons so anything that isn't above will not be soaked up. Salt is known to be a little leaky but I haven't found it to be too problematic. It's not as bad as a leaky tampon and I also bought thinx which are nice but the diva cup is better.\n\n  \nPlus they are cute and not disgusting in the bathroom. I'm not embarrassed if my husband sees it on the counter or something because it's bright and colorful. You just rinse it and it all goes down the sink. It could be a problem in public bathrooms but even on a heavy day I don't need to change it so I just don't.\n\n  \nI have a large one and a small one and the other day I was like oh I feel like I am going to start my period today but I haven't yet. So I put in the small one and after a day of skiing I got home and sure enough, I did but I didn't have to worry about it all day.",

I almost forget about my period with a diva cup, I even cramp less. You can wear them for 12 hours without changing them. It's even better than it sounds in real life.\n\nYou should watch at least this video before use though: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMziA2Y2iqg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMziA2Y2iqg)\n\nAlso, diva cups is just what I call them but there are actually many brands now. I use Salt because it's really soft and comfortable. If you don't wear one over night I recommend taking like a half bath after putting it in because they don't dry you out like tampons so anything that isn't above will not be soaked up. Salt is known to be a little leaky but I haven't found it to be too problematic. It's not as bad as a leaky tampon and I also bought thinx which are nice but the diva cup is better.\n\nPlus they are cute and not disgusting in the bathroom. I'm not embarrassed if my husband sees it on the counter or something because it's bright and colorful. You just rinse it and it all goes down the sink. It could be a problem in public bathrooms but even on a heavy day I don't need to change it so I just don't.\n\nI have a large one and a small one and the other day I was like oh I feel like I am going to start my period today but I haven't yet. So I put in the small one and after a day of skiing I got home and sure enough, I did but I didn't have to worry about it all day.",

So I explained how I didn\u2019t have one anyway, so tampons certainly didn\u2019t matter. The two women just were horrified and stared. I enjoyed that reaction in Sunday School.",

Plenty of people know what you go through, I\u2019m not trying to diminish you. I\u2019m not even arguing with you. I want to be clear that im making a distinction between having a psychological and/or physical health disorder and then being someone who never tries (which I was not calling you). I\u2019m not saying \u201cjust be happy\u201d or \u201cjust get help\u201d. It\u2019s going to be a long road , I\u2019ve bee in in therapy for about 20 years now. Also, you\u2019re a gen x, which proves my point that this boomer toxicity of masculinity was directly passed on.\n\nNow, please please listen to this one piece of advice if you don\u2019t listen to anything else I say .. this is something I really REALLY had to learn and it\u2019s a very hard truth: It is not the fault of the other person if they can\u2019t handle your issues. Really, if they can\u2019t then do you want to be with them anyway? It\u2019s also not YOUR fault. Your issues are not you. When you have a flashback and get angry, or feel like something is wrong with you\u2026it isn\u2019t you at all. We as people with ptsd have different brains, simply put. Unfortunately this means that people might have to set up their own boundaries and sometimes leave. It\u2019s because they need that energy to take care of themselves, or it\u2019s because they aren\u2019t very strong people who can endure second-hand what you and I go through. It happens with women too. Many people have seen my first panic attack and leave. You can\u2019t give up, you have to keep fighting, and you also can\u2019t think all women are this way. Focus on you, on getting support from professionals, on taking each day as it comes. Find something that fulfills you that you can push yourself to do a bit of\u2026because mister, I guarantee you Reddit is not the place to find fulfillment or peace of mind.",

Though my parents were very old when I was born (Dad 44 Mom 38) so they were born in WW2 years and have that old mentality.  \n\n\nThanks for explicitly saying you're not trying to diminish me. I often have to prove my human worth in triplicate to someone when talking about this stuff, including elsewhere in the thread.  \n\n\nI do have your advice in my heart and disposition. It's not their fault if they can't handle being around a damaged, broken person. I get it - I don't want to be around me either! I would give almost anything to have even a day's worth of a break from PTSD.  \n\n\nI don't think all women are this way, but I do think abusive people find broken people like me to exploit. It's documented in PTSD literature (you may already know this but just in case someone else reads this deep) that sufferers are often re-traumatized throughout life in similar ways to the original trauma. I'll ignore red flags and abuse and endure so much pain because I'm so desperate to be treated like an actual human being. And when I learned enough to be able to eliminate people in my life who weren't good for me, all I found out was that no one else was interested except those exploiters/abusers. So I ended up totally alone. \n\nSo I have been trying, for decades. I'm in therapy, have tried just about everything I'm able to try, but if no one ever ends up being able to handle it, and it's no one's fault, where does that leave me? Right where I am, just waiting to die, without hope of any healing.  \n\n\nAnd totes, Reddit is an absolutely horrible place to try to find connection or compassion, but then again, so is the real world.",

Group therapy/AA type groups might make sense, and allow you to gain a greater sense of perspective, activity groups that allow you to interact with others without any expectation of a close relationship off the bat. \n\nI can sense the abject loneliness and loss of hope in you, but regardless of whether or not there's a big community of people right in your backyard wanting to be friends with you, there are DEFINITELY people who would be willing to sit near you while you knitted, or did woodworking, or volunteered at a homeless shelter. \n\nYou definitely need to just get yourself out of your bubble. Nothing changes when you don't make changes. \n\nYou've got this, dude. You can do one new thing within the next month. I don't know what it should be, but you can say yes to one chance to get out of the house and make a difference to your life.",

COVID has also halted most support group meetings, ESPECIALLY for new members. Most AA meetings (which wouldn't apply for me anyway, just an example) are invite-only and online now, at least in my area. Not that I trust any groups anyway.\n\nThere is absolutely not a big community of people waiting to be friends with a severely mentally ill, near-total shut in that's about one or two bad breaks from suicide. I know, because I've tried. In every way I'm able to and know how. When I was entering into EMDR treatment, the therapy strongly recommends you find a trusted friend or relative to decompress with after sessions, to keep you emotionally grounded in a safe place. After 2 months of trying, I couldn't find a single friend willing to hang out one afternoon a week, to help my mental health and my treatment, at the cost of hanging out and watching a movie or whatever. Couldn't even get anyone in my life to value me that much.\n\nThe response I've gotten from people I've let in even a little bit just say severe PTSD from lifelong trauma is me throwing a pity party for myself. I've never had a single relative, adult, friend, mentor, or teacher ever stand up for me, protect my physical or mental safety, or advocate for me in any way. No one has ever validated what I went through, and no one cares if I get healthy or not. This is not a movie - there's no plucky waitress with a redemption arc waiting for me. My abuser is dead, and he died unpunished and unrepentant. The people responsible for letting it happen are dead, and died unpunished and unrepentant. I'll never get a 30-minute sitcom closure. They don't learn the meaning of Christmas at the end of this movie.\n\nVolunteer at the homeless shelter? Homie, I appreciate this, but I need a volunteer to help ME. I am incredibly, incredibly sick. I'm currently in day 4 of a mystery illness, and I'm hoping it's COVID so I can have an excuse to die alone in my apartment. I haven't eaten in 2 days, mostly because I'm terrified of hurting someone else with my piece of shit diseased body. The last thing I'm gonna do is take someone with me for my sorry ass.\n\nI don't got this. At no point in my life have I ever had this. I've never known what it's like to \"have it\" - and it was beaten out of me on a daily basis that I never would. There's never been anyone who's given me a break or a hand up or an easy time on this - I have always been expected to man up, be the stronger person, not show weakness, etc. When my brother died, my parents told me not to talk to them about because \"this time wasn't about me\". My parents prioritized career, social standing, religion, and money over my physical safety from my earliest memory until the day they died. I have been dumped for crying in front of a girlfriend, and our entire culture is geared towards enforcing that the last thing that should matter to literally anyone is some lonely white dude's feelings.\n\nI don't know why I typed this all out. Maybe I just want folks to know that there are people out there like me that exist, and that not everyone gets a Hallmark ending. Some people just get PTSD, lost life's game of musical chairs, and everyone is too busy with their own shit to care about the dude who never gets better that's dying slowly in front of them. It's easier to just not watch.",

Just because somebody is mentally ill does not mean they cannot be an asshole. \n\nIf somebody is an asshole mental illness does not change the fact. You should give *leeway* to somebody because of it and a pass, but if the person becomes a repeat offender and shows no interest in actually trying to change that fact (saying that they *have* to cause they\u2019re fucked up, or that their mental illness made them every single time) then that in itself becomes and cycle and at times manipulative. If somebody is repeatedly hurtful but ultimately justifies it under something again and again and expects the other person to just take it then that\u2019s not just mental illness, that\u2019s ultimately placing the responsibility on somebody whether they like it or not. \n\nShould the people around somebody respect the damage and try to support? Yeah. That gives us something. But so should they be expected to deal with everything? Absolutely not, particularly if they also have things they struggle with (such as their own mental illness) in life. The amount somebody can take should also be respected because they\u2019re ultimately respecting us, and that should be a mutual agreement. If it\u2019s not fair on either end bring it up and if nothing happens leave.",

Maybe this young/teen boy was also in denial about his homosexuality and so didn't realise his sexuality until young adult years; by this time the habit would have been ingrained in his hygiene routine, even after the homophobic elements were removed; resulting in a young gay man who doesn't wash his ass.\n\nI don't know why I typed that out.",

Maybe they will one day. The best thing I can do for someone in the shape that I was in is talk and hope something clicks for them. \n\nTrauma from childhood is different than it is for adults because it lays the foundation for how a person should react to reality. That\u2019s unfortunate. It\u2019s also unfortunate that it takes new trauma as an adult for some of us to view the world in a way that is healthy for the people who love us. \n\nLife isn\u2019t easy, but it\u2019s still good I tell ya hwut.",

It is extreme willful ignorance and arrogance that your world view and way of living is the only possible correct one, and anyone who is different doesn't deserve to live.\n\nPeople who are like this go on to abuse, torture and sometime even kill their children. Look up Gabriel Fernandez. \n\nI'm so sick of the focus being pulled from victims and being put on the \"poor men\" /s who are still actively abusing their families. Fuck him. And frankly fuck you too for trying to blame his behavior on his *wife*. He is the only one accountable for his actions. We have no idea the circumstances of that child's birth or that relationship dynamic but I doubt it's a healthy relationship.",

I'm a father of 3, eldest is a daughter and when my middle child boy was at the year / year and a half stage, he wanted to play dress up with his sister. We have some non gender specific things for dress up, but also have a few Disney princess style dresses. Once his sister starts putting on Elsa, he's gotta put on snow white. Grandpa was none to happy about those pictures, but geez, it doesn't mean that his sexual orientation destiny has been altered or determined or whatever. He's a 20 month old who is playing with his sister. Frankly, I'm going to love him no matter what. Just let kids be kids. They have the vast majority of their lives to feel compelled to conform. Let them hold on to those few fleeting years of freedom for as long as possible.",

I am completely atheist but I'm still pretty concerned at how little marriage means to young people. You literally repeat the words 'I shall stay with you until death do us apart', right?\n\nObviously divorce is a very necessary thing and I believe everyone should if their relationship is not right for them, but I also think people should make a bit more effort instead of \"throw that husband away\". You'll soon learn that any successful long term relationship is, at least in part, about compromise (on both sides ofc).\n\nAll I wanted to say about your comment is that, if it really isn't humorous and you're dead serious, maybe the couple should consider seeing a psychiatrist or having a good one-to-one discussion about their views. Assuming that he is a man with controversial views, and therefore is a bad man and should be discarded, is a very toxic view (albeit increasingly popular). Trying to get over issues together, on the other hand, is much more healthy \ud83d\udc4d\n\nStarting to think that people these days have real commitment issues, damn.",

But also a lot of writing about Ares comes from Athens and other areas that didn't like Thracians, so it's very possible that we just saw the shittiest version of Ares depicted because Homer didn't like Thracians lmao. Meanwhile Rome was Rome, so we have firsthand accounts about their worshipping Mars and why they thought he was so cool.",

Over the course of the book you learn that Gatsby grew up poor and a menial laborer before he came into his riches, and so it's implied that his distinctive pink suit is meant to be his personal homage to his upbringing.\n\nThe other rich guys he hangs out with are making fun of his suit because it looks crass and lower class to them. Like, imagine if these days some millionaire who grew up a poor redneck only wore fancy suits that were flannel or camo. That's the intended effect here.",

For starters ure not gonna get many homophobes to admit such a thing and also feeling aroused or attracted to a man does not necessarily mean you are gay. You could be bi, you could be straight and there was just one guy that did it for you that one day. The standard of \"gayness\" is so low for males compared to females. If a guy kisses a guy once, all of a sudden he is labeled as everything he was taught to hate and apparently it's just a matter of time before he is wearing a dress. Females just do not feel the same level of pressure when it comes to that. Homophobes are many, but to truly go out of your way to be homophobic, you need something to take you there, something deeper. Maybe it's internalized homophobia, insecurities or an awful past experience. To the extent that the man described on this post is willing to go, as it pertains to his own 1 year old child, he just ain't right in the head and needs help.",

My point is that this is not very telling  considering that straight men commit the vast majority of violent crime generally speaking. Yet obviously we are not gonna get many openly gay men committing hate crimes so by definition this is a weird stat to quote as it also disregards the ratio of gay men to the ratio of straight men in the population. You could be right but you could also be wrong or it could be somewhere in between. And it's not like Reddit is getting this out of nowhere either. As a gay guy myself I don't have any issue with that assumption if it makes homophones uncomfortable and hopefully less likely to commit hate crimes out of fear of being called gay.",

We let him wear pink undies as a compromise. \n\n\nI have tempered the pink on occasion, as I would any other colour, least we are head to toe one colour all over and he updates his preference. \n\nAlso. Honestly the pink is very intense to have vomited all over our home. !\n\n\nI have to be honest I was worried at first - I worried I'd over indulge and enjoy buying the girls stuff and pretty glittery stuff that id sort of sadly been walking past for two years, that I'd accidentally end up forcing him in the opposite way.\n\n\nMy husband was reluctant only in that he fears him getting picked on. \nHe gets mistaken for a girl a lot and he's worried this is going to upset him and ruin his favourite things. \n\n\nHowever my son is also the most bullheaded confident loud child ever. \n\nHe has zero problems loudly going 'i'm a boy!\"\n\n\n And when asked why he kept getting told off at school for biting be responded \"they pick on me for being small but they stopped when I bit them\"\n\nI obviously don't encourage biting....but his logic is sound...\n\n\nSo we're not so worried tbh!\n\nAlso leggings are hands down the best clothes for young kids still getting used to using a toilet and it pissed me off they're \"girls clothes\"\n\n\n\nMaybe he'll turn out gay. Maybe be won't. You sure as shit can't tell by what a toddler choses to wear!",

It had nothing to do with sexuality at that point, because what kid thinks about that at the age of 2, let alone connecting it to outer presentation. \n\nIt helped me pick role models while ignoring gender completely, which in turn meant I had way more than most girls, plus I didn't worry about existing for anyone else/presenting myself as girly for other people.

And I took the attitude I was going to encourage him to be himself and enjoy what he enjoys and if other kids picked on him and made him not want to do that at the very least he knew he could come home and not face the same. \n\n\nI never want to be the person to ruin something he loves by stifling him, the world will do plenty of that.\n\n\n(And I'd like to add I'm happy to adapt this based on him.

You do not need to read this and I really recommend you don\u2019t unless you feel like reading a pointless paragraph. Kinda had some revelations when writing this, lol. Also don\u2019t take the points I make in this to heart, they probably suck.\n\n\nI think at some point, you might want to have the conversation that some people think pink is a \u201cgirl color\u201d and then explain to him why they think that and why it isn\u2019t, so that if he ever gets bullied for wearing pink, he knows that he is in the right and won\u2019t want to stop wearing pink. I remember that in elementary school, (maybe 3-5 grade) when a guy told me pink was his favorite color, I in ignorance told him that pink was a girl\u2019s color. He actually was pretty confident in his answer of \u201cno, it\u2019s not\u201d, and I never bothered with it further, which I think with your son\u2019s attitude would be his response. However, if I were a boy and I was told that, I would\u2019ve probably stopped wearing and liking pink altogether. That being said, I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve had social anxiety since I could interact with the world, so idk. \n\nAlso, good on you for not forcing gender stereotypes on your kid! I absolutely HATED pink, but everything in my life was pink because I was a girl. I think I even hated pink BECAUSE it was a girl color, but I could be projecting. I distinctly remember my mom saying that I used to love pink to me when I was maybe 4-5, but I think my mom just projected or something, and I told her I didn\u2019t want gifts that were pink, but looking back on it, I don\u2019t think she ever told my relatives I hated pink. My room was pink, for crying out loud! And when we changed the color, pink again! But this time, only a more muted pink because I didn\u2019t like pink, because my twin sister liked pink, so the room should still be pink! Ugh Christ, I\u2019m remembering so much shitty stuff. This is probably why I\u2019m having so many issues around my gender rn, and why I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m trans, especially because of all the doubts and thoughts I had about my gender when writing this (basically, wait, does this mean I just hated how my mom forced me to be a girly girl, and I was afraid to ask her to play with boy\u2019s toys and stuff, or did I ever ask her and she rejected the idea so I stopped? Is this just some sort of retaliation for not being able to explore my gender when I was a kid? You know, probably unhealthy things to think.).",

He came home very happy and the kids had been fine. I heard ONE boy saying to his mum \"but Alex is a boy, girls wear dresses not boys\" and his mum was pretty quick to correct him. \n\n\nI always liked blue as a kid and typically boy things - my interests aligned with my dad so he was happy to indulge and whilst I have no beef with how they raised me it did mean I didn't really embrace my more feminine side until I was much older. \n\nWhen I discovered I also like women alongside that I started to wonder about my own gender and whether my preferences had implications to my gender. \n\nI like women, I liked boy stuff. Did that mean I was a boy?\n\nEventually I reached the conclusion that no I was just me. And then I became much happier trying out make up and girly clothes and embracing my body as it looked. And if I'm not in that mood then I'm perfectly happy chucking on \"boy\" clothes. \n\nI've had long hair and shaved depending on my mood\n\nI like \"boy\" hobbies and I also have \"girl\" hobbies. It literally doesn't matter. \n\nYou'd be hard pressed to think I was a boy - I have a very female body! But like also I wouldn't give a shit if someone assumed based on my dress. \n\n\nAnd that's kinda how I wanna be with my kids.\n\nIf he is gay, he gay. If he's trans he's trans.\n\nBut it'll off the back of thing far deeper than just what colour top he wears. \n\nBut honestly I think (and maybe I'll be wrong!) Based on my experiences growing up a lot of the confusion and questioning can just be avoided by making it very clear you can like what you like and dress however you want and it doesn't matter, it doesn't \"mean\" anything you don't have to identify as a boy just because you look and dress stereotypically male. And vice versa. Gender neutral isn't androgyny it's just wear what you like it literally doesn't matter.",

If I (a man) am constantly thinking about sucking dicks, but I never suck any dicks, then I'm not gay because I haven't done any of that sinful gay behavior. The progressive person of course thinks that if you love thinking about sucking dicks then you're certainly at least a little bi..it's irrelevant whether you've ever actually sucked a dick.\n\nThe anti-gay evangelicals who eventually get \"busted\" having sex with men (Ted Haggard, for one example) embody this. They honestly believe that all men want to suck dicks (because they themselves want to suck dicks, and surely their experience is indicative of everyone's?) but only the men who have strayed from god's path act on these urges. They are not understanding that many men simply don't want to suck dicks at all.",

Not saying anything whatsoever about the baby and his sexuality, because that's just asinine. The husband is a hateful person. If this is only the tip of the iceberg, and I were married to someone like this, I wouldn't wait to see what was underneath the water. Then again, I would have probably paid attention to other red flags that he undoubtedly proudly waved prior to them being married. But I agree with you, she should talk to him, suggest therapy and see if he can be educated. I wouldn't risk my child's future sanity on him for long though.",

Firstly \n\n> Both groups\u2014non-homophobic and homophobic men\u2014showed significant engorgement to the straight and lesbian porn\n\nSo from the get-go, at best we're talking mildly to moderately bi. Not unnoteworthy, but I would say this softens your conclusion.\n\n> for the non-homophobic men, these percentages were 10 and 24, respectively\n\nWhile yes, the homophobes CLEARLY have higher arousal stats (expected), over a third of the non-homophobes also show arousal. Are they all closeted too? Perhaps, or maybe just the concept... the energy of sex, if you will, is arousing to them. Anecdotally I've heard plenty of people express this too, the idea that just seeing people get aroused is in itself arousing.\n\n> There is debate in the clinical literature about the semantics of this term, with some scholars introducing other constructs such as \u201chomonegativism\u201d to underscore the more cognitive nature of some people\u2019s antigay stance\n\nIt's acknowledged that the term \"homophobic\" isn't entirely locked down tight.\n\nAnd most importantly,\n\n> 64 self-reported straight males with a mean age of 20.3\n\nOf those 64, 35 were homophobic. A small-ish sample size for statistical inference purposes, and vanishingly small compared to the true population of homophobes. The mean age is also significant, as upbringings (and thus behaviours and opinions) differ greatly between generations. It's also not clear what the sampling method was, which could have introduced bias.\n\n\nLook, I'm totally on your side if your claim is that P(gay | homophobic) > P(gay | nonhomophobic). The study, even with its flaws, clearly supports this, and the commonality of catching homophobic officials in compromising homosexual circumstances compounds it. I agree with the article too - it's an important study that has conceptual merit and, although it's not enough to make broad inferences, it's indisputably indicative.\n\nI just think you're jumping the gun when you confidently claim that the *majority* of homophobes are closeted, and you're also being needlessly snarky. Both those things combined make me not want to side with you even though we're in agreement about the core details.",

My evidence is in the very article you linked.\n\n> arguing against a single word in my post: \"majority\".\n\nI'd have been happy to move on and let it go if you didn't double down on it and instantly get passive aggressive. It may seem like a minor thing to get hung up on to you, but that kind of exaggeration is the mechanism by which misinformation often spreads and grows. You haven't spread some massive lie or anything dramatic like that, but the small things build up over time.\n\n> Yeah, I'm sure the 80% here was just a fluke.\n\nYou clearly don't understand anything about statistical inference. Depending on everything I mentioned above AND MORE (such as the validity of the testing method for arousal and associating that with homosexuality, or the specifics of the populations the participants were sampled from), the results could very much be a fluke. Without seeing the data itself, it's impossible to say. It's also hard to judge which significance tests would be the most appropriate considering the way the data is partitioned, and that alone means that your conclusion that 26% + 54% = majority is *entirely* meaningless.\n\nThis is about more than picking you up on a flyaway comment, this is making a point that it's not good enough to see a study summarised, you need to actually understand what it's saying and its limitations. You made some overreaches, and that ultimately harms the presumed goal to expose homophobes because your statement is *so easy to poke holes in*. In these times of misinformation, you should check your confidence at the door before you start spouting claims because you'll end up victim to the Dunning Kruger effect.\n\n> Lastly, there's more research you can find online\n\nYou don't just get to say \"the evidence is out there, go look\" and expect the other person to spend their day following your claim up. You're the one who needs to provide it, otherwise you're just taking the piss. This has been a long established piece of internet etiquette, and even longer a basic principle of debate.\n\n\nand finally\n\n> I have no idea where you got these hypothetical \"sides\" from\n\nI simply meant that although I think (based on what I've seen you say and defend) I probably agree with you on a lot of things regarding homophobia, I think your way of going about things sucks.",

This is *obviously* incredibly unhealthy and seems to result in doubling down on their beliefs.\n\nImagine if you truly believed that some trait was truly morally wrong or even evil, and you could feel in the back of your mind that you had that trait. Most people would be in denial and try their best to suppress it, and the best way to convince yourself you DON'T have a certain trait, or at least to throw people off the scent, is to be vocally against it.\n\nMy gripe with the guy above me was that he was extrapolating a conclusion based on results that he didn't know was statistically significant or not, but my gripe with you is that you're assuming the worst intentions of other people in this thread.

Participants consisted of a group of homophobic men (n = 35) and a group of nonhomophobic men (n = 29); they were assigned to groups on the basis of their scores on the Index of Homophobia (W. W. Hudson & W. A. Ricketts, 1980). The men were exposed to sexually explicit erotic stimuli consisting of heterosexual, male homosexual, and lesbian videotapes, and changes in penile circumference were monitored. They also completed an Aggression Questionnaire (A. H. Buss & M. Perry, 1992). Both groups exhibited increases in penile circumference to the heterosexual and female homosexual videos. Only the homophobic men showed an increase in penile erection to male homosexual stimuli. The groups did not differ in aggression. Homophobia is apparently associated with homosexual arousal that the homophobic individual is either unaware of or denies.",

Furthermore, it\u2019s likely that most of those who are in the closet do not feel the slightest bit of homophobia.

That's what he thinks a girl is due to his dad's strict gender roles. But when my nephew tell his own father this, his father doesn't ask questions, immediately googles a woman's vulva and says \"that's what you mean.\" Withoit trying to understand at all.\n\nIt made my sister cry. Her ex also blamed my sister for it AND his 7 year old for showing him that as if that absolves him from basically showing his child porn. I am outraged as well as the rest of our family that consists of all women. Yet nephews dad claims we are \"trying to change him into a girl\" because nephew is comfortable enough to ask us to paint his nails and we compliment his style (kid dresses better then I do). \n\nHe's a fucking idiot traumatizing his son all because he fears he might be gay.",

Eugenics takes that right away *again* for a collectivist goal.\n\nSo from an ethics perspective you have to look at *why rights exist* and then weigh the *right to bodily autonomy* through some lens and see if it's more valuable to have that right or not. \n\nAs an example, I believe that the goal of rights are the same ones NORAD outlines in the *Handbook in Human Rights Assessment: State Obligations, Awareness and Empowerment*, that the goal is *an increase the standard of living, equality and opportunity of those living under the protection of the State.* Therefore, it stands to reason that eugenics-imposed limits on bodily autonomy (which is, indirectly, a limit on opportunity) have to weighed again against the theoretical gains in both standard of living and equality. In turn, I posit that it is in fact possible to implement such measures in such a way that the reduction in opportunity is much lesser than the long term gains in the other two categories on a societal scale. \n\nMany places around the world already makes it illegal for women to consume alcohol while pregnant, for example, which goes against bodily autonomy in the interest of having a healthy child. Taking this logic further to include \"breeding using knowingly-flawed genetic material\" doesn't take mental gymnastics as much as a couple steps in a direction already taken. As for enforcement, that's a different can of worms.",

A world where everyone is free from risk of cancer/autoimmune disease, live longer, can do more things with more strength and intelligence, etc etc. \n\nI say this as a Jew, with immediate family survivors.

Whenever anyone says something like \"we're replacing a defective gene with a functional one\", that functional gene is based on the genome of another (implicitly **superior**) human.  For a particularly racially-charged example, it's not hard to imagine gene therapy for sickle-cell using a genetic profile from people of European-descent.  The effect of this would be to eliminate \"black\" genes and replace them with \"white\" ones.  This could happen without any specific malice or racist intent, but that's still the effect it would have in this case.  It wouldn't surprise me if researchers even make a point of choosing genetic profiles of healthy relatives (at first) just to avoid the whiff of eugenics.  The problem is, as the process becomes more widespread, these customized bespoke treatments would likely cost a hell of a lot more to make than continuing to use already-approved-and-effective genetic profiles.\n\nAs direct gene editing becomes more common, especially in the context of fertility clinics, there will be a movement to eradicate certain genes from the population entirely.  And while there are some (like cystic fibrosis) that we can all pretty much agree are detrimental genes, the only question is how we define \"genetic disorder\".\n\nIf a common predisposition to obesity (in, let's say 10% of the population) is defined a genetic disorder, then the cure will likely be a single genetic profile developed to replace it.  If it is widely circulated, then essentially 10% of the population's metabolic rate will have been modeled on a single \"superior\" human trait (and eradicating a wide variety of natural mutations to those same genes in the process).  And why stop there?  This superior genetic profile will probably outperform 90% of people who are deemed \"normal\", and the treatment may become incredibly easy.\n\nA retroviral cocktail with a narrow effect, such as rendering a person completely immune to HIV, may be so appealing that physicians develop it as a contagion: something that can be released into populations to spread on its own.\n\nThe massive diversity of the collective human genome would be whittled down with every new cure, but on a case by case basis, it's hard to argue that the world is a better place when people have genes that make them demonstrably weaker, sicker, slower, dumber, or unwell.\n\nShort of a complete collapse of medical development, this is the path we are on.  We will create a library of genes that we consider \"superior\" (or at least \"default\"), and constantly nudge ourselves toward it with every gene therapy.",

But if you can set aside the blatant racist impulses, the danger of eugenics has always been that it is reasonable.  Seductive, even.  That seduction is still there, and it will continue to be.\n\nBut do you penalize parents for letting their children be born with natural / inferior genes?  Do you refuse treatment for their symptoms?  Jack up their healthcare costs in an effort to incentivize them accepting the better genes?  You're into Gattaca territory there.\n\n(In truth, I think these issues are on the other side of an even bigger disruption of Artificial General Intelligence, so I don't personally worry about them as much as I do AGI.  But it is worth keeping an eye on, anyway.  Undoubtedly there will be some genetic bottlenecking as humans become commonly edited, and that will bring with it the specter of eugenics.)",

He\u2019s caused a lot of division, and constantly gives mixed messages.\n\nWe\u2019d **all** be more than happy to see every pedophile prosecuted in a court of law, and thrown in *real* prisons (instead of the current BS of \u201cshuffling them around\u201d after a scandal). We want to start fixing bad aspects of our reputation, but instead he (the Pope) is over there talking about dogs and trying to get rid of TLM. Talk about grasping at straws for a distraction. \n\nThings are getting pretty heated in the community, so let\u2019s hope that this momentum continues and we see some positive change soon.",

You get a positive pregnancy test: mandatory education, paid for by the government. I think if you see how some of the conversations play out you'll see I'm more arguing for training and certification-style than a kind of licensing that would imply control over reproduction.\n\nI still see potential problems, but I feel like if designed properly most of them could be ironed out.

It's about responsibility, not about worth.\n\nThe fact that you jumped to that conclusion is very telling on how licenses operate in your country or state.\n\nLicenses don't always require testing, sometimes you need to take a seminar or a course that will teach you what you need to know beforehand.\n\n\nThis is not about arbitrarily limiting people's choices, is about informing them on what it entitles and people who can't be responsible for their own kids shouldn't have them.\n\nWhich doesn't mean they have to be forced into having abortions or sterilized like many of you claim (again, this is NOT eugenics). \n\nIm not OP, but IMO people who don't get the license can try again later, no biggie.\n\n\nOf course all of this is hypothetical, there's no way to implement it on every culture or country, but it could help ensure that children are born into loving, responsible households",

You're trying to push a false equivalence about a driving test and a parenting test. Please stop.\n\nI've explained in several comments that this is not something that should require testing, is about education, but you still want to push the very valid argument of disabled people being discriminated, which as I said, is not the case.\n\n>Being disabled whether physically or mentally does impair parents ability towards being able to become the best parents for their children, you can not deny this. That also doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll turn out to be bad parents but it does mean that a test requiring you to prove your ability as a parent would be unfair to them. \n\nI AGREE, but you cannot group all mental disabilities as one and the same. There's a big spectrum of mental disorders and yeah, i agree that it would be the only concern about disabled parents.\n\nFor example, I'm sure that people with ADHD, Autism, depression or even things like OCD or Tourette's can be great parents with the right tools (counseling, familiar/social support, therapy, maybe meds).\n\nBut, people with severe illnesses like Bipolar disorder, Borderline, Schizophrenia or Cotard's syndrome would probably traumatize their children in many ways, so in these rare cases a more individual approach would be needed and that would be very prone to abuse (like Witchunting, you could accuse your ex of being Bipolar just to make them lose custody).\n\nSo yeah, that's a great point and it should be addressed if this kind of thing would ever be implemented. \n\n\nThe thing is, no one is advocating for the implementation of this kind of stuff, it's just not doable IRL. OP's comparison is not the same as advocating for the implementation of this kind of stuff.\n\nThat's why my approach is about educating people about parenthood, not about prohibiting people from having children. And I know that it's also unrealistic because we suck as species and we wouldn't be able to implement such a thing. \n\nBut is it that bad to fantasize about an utopic world where every child is born into a responsible and loving home?

No one said that.\n\nMy own narrative? You mean the one about educating people instead of testing them? The original commenter never mentioned tests of any kind.\n\nNo one is defending anything, just because the discussion originated from a driver's license comparison doesn't mean that I completely agree or defend the analogy, I'm just trying to offer an alternative perspective on the matter.\n\n\nBut I forgot how reactionary and tribalistic reddit is sometimes. \"Oh you disagree with me?

              "text": "Eh, this is a short-sighted and kinda shallow take. We can still see homophobia stemming from the original division of sexuality into these zones such as \"straight,\" \"bisexual,\" \"homosexual,\" etc. That does not mean that those zones are actually real, more so they are descriptions, not wholly accurate ones at that, for sexual preference.\n\nOriginally, there was no such thing as gay people or straight people, and people would just fuck who they wished to fuck. But, eventually, this division between gay/straight arose through cultural shifts and lgbt+ people, unsurprisingly, as they have always been in the minority, have been discriminated against. This (in reality, but not socially as it has affect) fictitious division has led to straight people being preferred and lgbt+ people being discriminated against through culture. However, as we know, the division is not as clear cut as it is made out to be. There is overlap, and no one 100% is going to fall into a single category.\n\nWith that in mind, if someone is trying desperately to fit into a category that doesn't match 100% with their sexuality, a common defense mechanism would be to assert that category, which can really only be done by \"not\" being the other. For example, we only know the color \"blue\" because it is not orange, red, green, etc. But there is really only one color, all of them. This is why I don't see it as homophobic to suspect that someone is repressing sexuality when they have an over-the-top reaction against lgbt+.\n\nTL;DR - The reason this is misconstrued as homophobic is because of our  (always) outdated and fictitious cultural perception on lbgt+ in relation to \"straightness.\"",

Once the kid had the toy, he wouldn't take it from him, he just wouldn't allow him to get it to begin with. So if I gave him a toy kitchen or toy vacuum while dude was at work, he wouldn't do anything about it.\n\nThings lightened up a lot when I had my own son. My kid would bring all sorts of \"girly\" toys around and both kids would play with them, I think dude lost his will to fight it. There was a time where he tried to stop the kids from hugging but no one else was on his side so that didn't work.",

I grew up straight and eventually married the love of my life which we are now expecting our first. However, I remember as a child my father would get so mad at me for things like this, very innocent and generally just curious about the world. I would get in trouble for eating a popsicle \u201ctoo deeply\u201d and even get yelled at for wearing my mom\u2019s shoes when i was 3. I later learned in life that my father was subject to trauma growing up where to the best of my knowledge bordered sexual abuse by other boys in school in a 3rd world country. He then would become a father and impose his reactive traumas to me as a little boy. It went so far as to push highly sexualized women and content on me go ensure that I was not gay and eventually confronted me about being gay several times in highschool because it was not normal for a boy between 14-18 to not have a girlfriend. To OP, I would suggest having dialogue with your husband about any types of traumas he might have experienced and or maybe even suggest therapy to him to explore his deeply homophobic feelings towards your child, these conversations will hopefully bring change and hopefully avoid the painful mental abuse that comes with a strict homophobic father like I had.",

It makes me wonder if he\u2019s desperately afraid of his own thoughts and actions revealing he has at least some minor interest in the male form. It\u2019s pretty common for people to be attracted to a variety of traits that aren\u2019t necessarily \u201cgendered\u201d traits, they could be into long thick hair for example, which you can obviously find on many people regardless of their gender. That combined with being raised in an environment that was full of alpha-male toxicity can leave a guy afraid of his own interests, because the rhetoric says he can be strong, or he can like men, but not both (even though it\u2019s clearly bs it can be hard to deindoctrinate ones self after being raised with those lies)",

      "text": "That third point doesn't surprise me one bit. \n\nMy oldest kid, when he was about 3 or 4 he was SUPER into Paw Patrol, like everything he wore at any given time was Paw Patrol. So, when you buy clothes for the kid who has all the Paw Patrol garb, you kinda run outta shit to buy. So we ended up buying him some Skye (or Sky, whatever it is) socks. She's a girl and going with the typical blue is for boys, pink is for girls sorta thing, these socks were grey and pink. My son fuckin **loved** these socks - not only were they Paw Patrol, they were pink and he *loved* pink. He loved em' so we were happy. \n\nMy mom comes over one day and he's playing away with his toys with his pink Skye socks on and my mom starts grilling him about how he's wearing girl socks. \"Oh, pink is for girls, you're not a girl, are you?\" Stuff like that. \n\nNeedless to say I wasn't having that shit, not in my house and not with my kid. Being a trades guy I'm not the most diplomatic fella either so I think I basically told her to \"knock it the fuck off or get out, he loves those socks and that's all the matters.\" She got all pissed off, we had a huge fight and I told her to leave. Our relationship hasn't been the same really... Don't remember if it was this incident or one of the other hundred times she's been critical of my parenting, my wife's body (she's had 3 kids and 5 pregnancies, so yeah, she's got a few extra curves and I love it), how my kids dress, the toys they play with, etc. \n\nAnyways, not sure if my mom somehow thought my kid wearing his favorite pink socks was gonna magically make him gay or trans but whatever. He still loves pink, purple, flowers, books, helping me cook, etc. Now, I got my kids back regardless and I'd be slightly disappointed if he was gay or trans - and not because I have an issue with either group of people but for reasons I don't want to get into because they're often misunderstood and I don't wanna argue with people but if he was gay or trans I'm sure it's not gonna be because he wore a fictional characters pink fuckin socks. I'd love him and support him regardless.\n\nThe other thing I don't understand about this post is LIKING BOOKS TOO MUCH?! For real, one of the best things my wife ever forced me into with my kids was reading to (or with) them every night. We read a minimum of 1-2 stories a night before bed. I say forced because it wasn't something my mom (single parent, never home, always working) never had time to do with my brother and I. Anyways, not only do I love curling up with my boys and my daughter to read a book but it's incredibly beneficial to their development. Plus, watching them fall in love with stories and fantasy world's is really cool.",

E.g\n\n\"Sweetie, it's concerning me how much you're fixating on a one year old childs sexuality. I'm not judging, I just would like to get to the root of this and see if there's anything that can help you out of this mindset. Its making me a little uncomfortable as children are not sexual beings, and I feel like you may have repressed issues from your childhood that need to be addressed.

I am. The most intense homophobia has come from closeted guys in high school and my own father. Twin concordance studies prove that same-sex sexuality is a complex heritable trait\u2014 meaning I am more likely to be gay because my parents passed it on to me. In my case my father saw traits and tried to correct it, often through violence. I have 4 brothers, all straight, we all opening acknowledge that I was singled out to try and \u201cnurture\u201d my \u201cnature\u201d away. \n\nMy dad seems like a 2 on the Kinsey scale, I\u2019m a 6. He couldn\u2019t handle it. This story about a father intensely worrying about his 1-year old\u2019s sexual orientation and gender expression screams internalized homophobia to me. I am just a person on the internet, but look at all the religious and political leaders who projected their self loathing on others (e.g. Roy Cohen and Ted Haggard).",

We can't know for at least 3-4 years (the onset of complex language and play acting) at the earliest, and really probably not for 10-12 more (onset of puberty and real sexual urges). Even then we will really only know if he grows up to trust us an communicate with us. But... Just for the sake of argument... What if he is? Because your worry is clearly already a quite serious, and the older he gets the more he will internalize your fear, which will turn into self loathing and a lifetime of therapy if he is, in fact, gay.\"",

And if he does turn out gay, you\u2019ll need your husband to be his Dad. Being there for him and teaching him to be masculine, and passing on his own lessons is more important that what sexual partners he may or may not have. Who knows, he might end up alone all his life.

Less than 100% straight let's call it... but he's grown up in a family or peer group that would be very negative if he were to be truthful so he's had to suppress it and hide it and feels shame which can lead to anger/irrationality about the subject.\n\nOr maybe he's arrow straight but he's just very ignorant about sexuality and is just exceptionally overreacting to something out of fear of the unknown.\n\nEither way, the kid is 1, infants like colors and lights, if he's gay he's gay... It's not like there are \"steps to ungay him\" or something.  Either you have a healthy, normal kid, who likes normal things, who will someday like women or you have a healthy, normal kid, who likes normal things, who will someday like men.

Is he verbally or emotionally abusive towards you? I get it it\u2019s Reddit so you probably won\u2019t say but I bet he is!

He got called a girl at school because his last winter hat was a dark blue cat with pink pom-poms and was so heartbroken.

Not backing down on that one Reddit. That's way too fckin creepy. You need to leave him immediately - he is definitely gay which is why he's so scared your son is, and he's also deff a perv. Not to mention a close minded pigheaded idiot. \n\nNeed I say more?\n\n(I know this isn't a direct post but in hopes she finds it/ or anyone dealing with anything remotely similar saw this thread - RUN)",

Is there some sexual trauma or something he doesn't realise is sexual trauma?\n\nPlease get your husband to seek councelling, for the sake of your son who will grow to never be able to escape this. If his own father is sexualizing him as a child, imagine what's going to happen as he is growing and going through puberty etc.\n\nThese thoughts going through your husband's head are unhealthy, he definitely has serious issues related to childhood and sexuality. Sit down and gently ask him about his childhood and tell him you are concerned, and would like him to see a therapist.",
