Support evolution of self, support evolution of planet.  Evolution of science and technology of planet (macrocosm) follows evolution of self (microcosm). Spirit and science can co exist.  \n\nEarth and it's organism (including humans) are \"God's\" creation so should be protected seems politically sound and reasonable.  \n\nGreed is materialism, so greed needs to be protected against.  Protect the poor and vulnerable.  \n\nMath/science are completely legitimate since they are just a physical way to explain the universe, which is a physical representation of spirit. Technology a physical function of spirit.  \n\n\"God\" gives us free will, so it is not our right to interfere, to use spirit to justify violating any individuals free will by imposing the selves spiritual beliefs over another.  Spiritual beliefs can guide us, as long as they don't violate the free will of others.  True spirituality is secular.\n\nThe true spirit supports science, secularism, and logic/reason.  The problem with many who are religious is that most are not truly spiritual.  They are fear based people that need to be told by some higher authority what to think, and then have to impose that upon everyone even those who disagree.  Not spiritual.  The people that run religion are not spiritual they are authoritarian.  Spirituality and religion are ideological opposites, and spirituality is more aligned with science then religion.  I wish there was more spiritual minded politicians and I wish the science/reason/logic people would see the common ground with the truly spiritual people.  Instead of, science/reason people segregating anyone that believes in spirit with the religious people who are opposed to both of groups.",

It is the centralization of spirit.  Authoritarianism uses spirit to repress the will and thoughts of others.  A spiritualist has traditionally been just as much been a victim and continues to be a victim of religion as much as an atheist.  I mean in the bible Jesus and the people are victims of the Jewish religion.  He constantly tries to uproot the hold the Jewish priest had over the people, and they crucify him for it.  He tried to use reason and they persecuted him for reason.\n\nIs it not reasonable to say if there is a God that everything that exists is a creation of that God so it is important to treat others well, to love others, because the self and others come from the same thing.  Is it really that different than saying we all come from the same stardust, which coalesced from nebula's, all living and sharing the same planet, so we should care about everyone and the planet like we do ourselves?  Is this not a fair and universal policy?  Is this not based in reason?  Love others like they are the self, treat others how you wish to be treated.\n\nJust because what you subjectively draw from a subjective religious text does not make it unreasonable.  Is there valuable moral teaching in these texts? Yes.  Are some of the details ridiculous? Yes.  Are the texts trying to draw moral lessons from their peoples limited understanding of the mechanics of the world which makes some of the stories ridiculous? Yes.  Does religion take these texts from a people with a much more limited understanding from our own, focus on fantastical detail, and then pervert the moral lesson for their own ends? Yes.  \n\nCan I believe in God, have faith in God, but still have fair, reasonable, and universal policies? Yes.  Can those policies be rooted in science and logic even though I believe in God. Yes.  Can those policies be completely fair to others who dont believe in God? Yes.  Is God somehow separate from logic and science? No.  If I believe in God then I believe God created science and logic because there is science and logic, so science and logical reasoning are a gift created by God, and to not follow logical reasoning and science, to make fair and universal policies based on science and logical reasoning (which is presented by God), is to be unfaithful to God.",

DoD Instruction, Air Force Instruction, and Duty AFI for chaplains all direct that \u201cbeliefs of moral principle, conscience, or religion\u201d be treated equally under the RA process. \n\nAnother Air Force member already has an atheist RA waiver approved, hopefully mine will be approved within the next few weeks. An endorsement from this entity would go a LONG way towards spreading awareness and encouraging service members to pursue this process.\n\nEdit: responding to the deleted reply and the downvotes, while atheism isn\u2019t a religion itself, it is a protected religious group. Under Equal Protection and the Establishment Clause, anything offered to religious people must be offered in kind to non-religious people. That\u2019s why atheists can still use the RA process. \n\nThank you for showing exactly why this kind of awareness spreading I mentioned is needed.",
