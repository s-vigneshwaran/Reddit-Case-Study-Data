If you have a GOOD reason for paying that much,  let us know. Don't be a dick about it. Is it printed on absurdly expensive paper with absurdly expensive ink?

Like you're so far above us peons. Treating us like we aren't even people. It sure is your prerogative to spend 70 dollars for a 10 dollar poster. And it's our prerogative to tell you that was a bad choice. \n\nThe fact that this is so last minute and so poorly planned out that you used the phrase \"quickly delivered just arriving this AM\" yet you managed to get the press releases and go fund me page set up, reinforces even more that giving YOU money to do this campaign would be poorly spent. That also means you posted all this news and tried to rile everyone up before you even actually did the deed if it hasn't even shown up yet.\n\nFor someone who has been doing this for decades, you sure aren't very good at it. All you had to do was be a reasonable person and everyone here would have rallied behind you.\n\nEdit: big shot celebrity activist is now complaining about his downvotes on Twitter, like him insulting and belittling everyone here was somehow OUR fault.",

On July 21, 930, the capital city was struck by heavy rain and lightning, and many of the leading Fujiwara died, while fires caused by lightning and floods destroyed many of their residences.\n\nThe court of the Emperor drew the conclusion that the disturbances were caused by Michizane's angry spirit, and, to placate it, the Emperor restored all Michizane's offices, burned the official order of exile, and ordered that the poet be worshiped under the name Tenjin, which means sky deity.\n\nA shrine was established at Kitano; it was immediately raised to the first rank of official shrines, supported directly by the government.\n\nFor the first few centuries, then, Tenjin was seen as a god of natural disasters, worshiped to placate him and avoid his curses. However, Michizane was a famous poet and scholar in his lifetime, one of the greatest of the Heian period, and in the Edo period scholars and educators came to regard him as a patron of scholarship. By the present day, this view has completely eclipsed natural disasters in popular worship.\n\nTenjin's influence is now regarded as particularly strong in passing exams, and so many school students, and their parents, pray for success at his shrine before important entrance exams, and return afterwards, if appropriate, to give thanks for success.",

In general just say \"bless you\", but that still holds religious affiliation. \"Good-bye\" is the shortening of \"god be with you\", but I don't see that being thrown out by atheist circles. I think the majority of people can differentiate between historical and religious context. I'm bothered whenever I hear a president say \"god bless America\" because of the political motivations behind it, as well as it adding legitimacy to \"Christian American values\" in government, not to mention it's pandering. But I don't get bothered when someone says it after I sneeze.",

I said \"God\" is defined differently across the Abrahamic faiths, and I said Islam says **worshipping** Jesus is a form of shirk (the worst sin: associating partners with Allah). My point is that according to Jews, Christians are not worshipping \"God,\" and neither are Muslims. According to Christians, Muslims are not worshipping \"God.\" According to Muslims, Christians *who worship Jesus* are not worshipping \"God\" and are committing shirk, the unforgivable sin.\n\nI have far more familiarity with Islam than you and speak Arabic, so don't think telling me that Jesus is a prophet in Islam is some amazing, world-shattering information for me.",
