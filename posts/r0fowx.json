In fact when Islamic slaves were brought over they were able to pray and worship under the guise of catholisism since they are so similar in practice and doctrine. Over many years of persecution and indoctrination these religions warp into christianity. At the time both slaves and slaveholders technically practices the same religion but it wasent actually the same religion, with the slaves using it as a look towards salvation and freedom which differed from the purpose of the slaveowners. In the end christianity is actually what helped slaves escape their situation along with being the reason they were enslaved its deeply complex and intresting.",

Why was I the only one not having any of it? Am I not going to be good in the family anymore? When I started saying that I didn\u2019t believe in it I was hit with \u201cit means so much to your (insert relative) don\u2019t hurt them\u201d so I would be guilted into going. I then had to kinda fight back by telling them how uncomfortable church made me feel. How out of place and lost I felt listening to these dated stories while taking all these peoples money. Constantly mailing things asking for people to donate money. It was a really long swim upstream but I stayed respectful with my responses without attacking the religion and eventually got left alone. Now with all the news that\u2019s come out about the Catholic Church, a chunk of my main family no longer goes to church (before Covid lol) because they realized it isn\u2019t a way to spend time or money because it\u2019s not as important as the previous generations made it out to be. \n\nLast service I went to was an Easter one. Almost three hours and full of people asking you to put your hands up and send magical words to the people getting dunked in water. Felt like I was in some weird cult movie and was just the last nail in the coffee with me going to church. The guilt eventually went away when my family saw that I was still a good person without religion and that I was respectful of others beliefs. I don\u2019t care what religion someone belongs to as long as it doesn\u2019t interfere with the happiness of others or the well being of others or themselves. A part of me is jealous of people who believe cause it must make some of the harsh realities of life easier to deal with, but then I\u2019m glad that I like to ask questions and get real answers.",

Which, is kind of just like another way of saying that it's because you're extremely american lol. The correlation between black americans and christianity is pretty strong\n\n..it's obviously super oversimplified to say that's \"*why*\" anybody believes anything but if the ultimate argument is that you probably believe it because your parents do and they probably believe it because their parents do and their parents probably believed it because their parents did and their parents ...were slaves who were taught/made to believe it against their will. Then that might be just about the closest thing to a a point there is to make about this. But those are also the same reasons why most non black americans are christians too just minus that one part about the slavery at the end. \"Because your parents believed it\" is about the height of the argument but that also applies to basically everyone.",

Their bibles were edited to be even more pro-slavery, but nonetheless stories about ~~Abraham~~ Moses (\"Let my people go!\"), a Savior, and a future free from pain and suffering were a refuge and major source of hope to a people treated worse than cattle. Many abolitionists and civil rights leaders also leaned on it during their struggles, crediting their faith for the progress made. That got handed down, just like most of us were born into the religion of our parents. So when it's that much of a cultural identity surrounding it, it's hard to shake.\n\nChristianity is a textbook abusive relationship. God claims to love us but will torture us if we don't do exactly what he says. He claims that we are special and beautiful, but also somehow worthless and will never find true love or fulfillment apart from him. It holds on hard and people end up giving up their identity, freedom, and expression for a sense of security and purpose.",

When questioned by this oblivious inconsistency many will profess religious and ridgid binary roles and views that influence how they relate to other queer people. \n\nMethinks there is a certain strand of internalized phobias to non binary people and relationships which are just strands of homo phobias that they probably had to deal with and fight against during their particular journey. \n\nHyper religiosity in marginalized communities, IMHO, has roots in self hatred in conjunction with other cultural phenomena.

They are catholic, because they've been programmed by force, any surviving remnants of their culture now exists in a bastardized form under the name of whatever saint or as 'the Virgin Mary'.\n\nWhen people are made to be slaves, their cultural identity is stripped from them and they are given one that fits into the ideology of their slavers. When freedom is earned, how does one reclaim culture that has been lost to them for hundreds of years? I can't even begin to answer that",

Like, yes, those religions absolutely brutalized and forcefully converted black slaves while systematically robbing them of their language, culture, and religion in order to maintain social control and prevent slave uprisings.\n\nOn the other hand, the segregated black churches also became their own thing after a few generations and formed the foundation of pretty much every black social rights movement in history. MLK was a pastor, and the social networks developed around black churches played a huge role in organizing to end segregation. Similar story with Malcolm X and the Black Panthers - they both had roots in the Nation of Islam movement. Nation of Islam was particularly notable in that it challenged the social order of institutional white supremacy, as one of the central beliefs was that modern day black Americans were God's chosen people descended from the Moabites, rejecting the prevalent (and profoundly ignorant) image of abrahamic religious figures as white savior types.\n\nThey also had (and still have) some pretty big issues. In particular both religions have very misogynistic and homophobic traditionalist views. But worth noting that the history is not quite as cut and dry there, those two religions have been both oppressive and also directly responsible for the majority of black social progress and community activism.",

Although most practice traditional Chinese religions such as Taoism, and longer-standing foreign imports such as Buddhism, **Protestant Christianity is probably the fastest-growing faith, with at least 38m adherents today (about 3% of the population), up from 22m a decade ago,** according to the government\u2019s count. **The true number is probably much higher**: perhaps as many as 22m more Chinese Protestants worship in unregistered \u201cunderground\u201d churches, according to a new study by researchers at the University of Notre Dame\n\nSo that\u2019s >16 million converts to Christianity in 10 years, as a *conservative* estimate, in a country that is 86% atheist, where the atheist government actively persecutes religious believers.\n\nChristians meet in \u201cunderground\u201d churches for fear of the government, much like the early Church hid in the catacombs to avoid the Roman persecution.",

He has a lot to say on the importance of maintaining a sense of community and meaning in the black community without the harmful aspects of dogmatic faith. He also teaches some pretty cool classes, like one on the history of atheism in blues and rap music. \n\nI highly recommend the episode of the Mindscape podcast he was on.

Escaping religion can feel like you're in that book at times.  \n\nI remember the time when I spotted some of the local conservative Christians in the nightclub shaking a leg (I knew them because we were some of the only Caribbeans in a very small city)...You know for a fact that a few hours later, they were all collapsing at their bed-sides to do a frantic prayer. To ask some guy to wash their whole body in his blood to cleanse them of their overpowering evilness. All this because they did a two-step to a Cascada song?\n\nYou can't even enjoy yourself without scheduling a session of flagellation. Yet they want the rest of us to join them? And we're immoral if we abstain from it? \n\nI'd argue that they're immoral for participating in it.

Granted, it's more of a scathing academic interest, in some cases, and can go to extremes on the other end of the spectrum. Still, some of the people that I know, who are most involved with the church, and regular Christian functions, openly admit to never reading it. They might listen to the preacher maybe, but that's about it. It's a social thing, and used as a tool for help with finding work, help with childcare, social connections, or money etc. \n\nThey like to think any terrible things they do will be forgiven, if they just ask for forgiveness. Despite that not actually being in the bible, you must repent, which requires regret. Imo it began with Judaism, as a life guide for a less educated world, and it did have its benefits. Maybe helping you to not eat dangerous meats, or overseeing food preparation, for example, or encouraging washing before supping. Of course, it was meant for a different time. They often quote the old testament, before their own New Testament, as the new testament is probably too liberal for them. They'd really hate Jesus, were a figure like him to exist today.",

You can rent a small apartment on the outskirts of Tokyo for the equivalent of $600 a month (or a decent three bedroom in a smaller city for about the same), which could be a welcome change for people from cities where closets now cost $1200/mo.\n\nCome to Japan!  Never again will anyone attempt to bully, shame or manipulate you because you don't believe in a Skydaddy.  Granted, you'll always be an outsider in Japan, but at least you'll have zero problems as an atheist.",

Apart from the sense of being in an in-group and repeating all of the mini rituals (knowing when to sit or stand and what to say in response to the priest), there was nothing in those sermons that actually appealed to kids as human beings.\n\nI would venture to say that most of the students in that school had no deep personal relationship with Catholicism and could easily have replaced it with any other Abrahamic religion given a few weeks' practice. Hell, I know this for a fact because the most outwardly religious guy in my grade later \"converted\" to Islam to piss off his parents/teachers, and then \"converted\" again to LaVeyan Satanism. In reality, all he did was fill out some online surveys to get enough money to buy a Qur'an and a copy of the \"Satanic Bible\".\n\nIn fact, he seemed much more comfortable in his own skin when he was pretending to be a Satanist, which shows just how shallow the religious indoctrination was. He went from quoting the bible to bully other kids who weren't \"Catholic enough\" to actually being able to express some parts of his real personality because the thrill of transgression overwhelmed the part of his mind that pretended to believe in the religious bullshit.\n\nI truly believe almost none of the kids I met in Catholic school got anything out of their \"faith\" other than a vague and precarious sense of belonging, which they could have gotten by much healthier means.",

I literally got punished for an entire day for drawing a Ninja Turtle when I was supposed to be focused on a lesson.

My parents went to the main service and the kids went to the kids service. Oh man, in the kid's service we were playing games for cash prizes, throwing nerf darts at targets with a $50 on it, with the occasional Christianity pep talk when everyone was ready to listen. Meanwhile, I'm sitting there thinking this looks more like a calculated exercise in indoctrination than any church service i've ever attended. \n\nI was already highly skeptical at that time but my lasting impression of all these new services is that the casualification of Christianity promotes Christianity as a cultural identity more so than a studied faith to be followed. It's for the type of Christian who thinks whatever they were going to think anyway, rationalize it with their faith, and then they pat themselves on the back because they go to church.",

But in doing historical research, we've learned that the christian church did serve as a safe space and a point of historical meaning for many enslaved people. When they were brought over on slave ships, their identities were erased and their owners gave them new, European identities. This would help to enforce their new enslaved mindset on the African groups. As time went on, enslaved people found that the christian church was a place where they could control their own identity and keep records of who was related to whom (since these were often erased by slave owners for monetary reasons). The church remained a big part of African American identity because of this. It served as a starting point for family histories. Later, the church served as a central point for civil rights activism because it was already at the center of people's lives.",

Enmark claims she had strategically established a rapport with the captors. She had criticized Bejerot for endangering their lives by behaving aggressively and agitating the captors. She had criticized the police for pointing guns at the convicts while the hostages were in the line of fire and she had told news outlets that one of the captors tried to protect the hostages from being caught in the crossfire. She was also critical of prime minister Olof Palme, as she had negotiated with the captors for freedom, but the prime minister told her that she would have to content herself to die at her post rather than give in to the captors' demands.\n\nNilis then goes on to coin Stockholm syndrome, (because a woman having those criticisms was nutters).\n\nIt\u2019s not a recognized diagnosis either \n\nHere\u2019s the FBIs take\n\n>FBI law enforcement bulletin (1999)\nA 1998 report by the FBI containing over 1,200 hostage incidents found that only 8% of kidnapping victims showed signs of Stockholm syndrome. When victims who showed negative and positive feelings toward the law enforcement personnel are excluded, the percentage decreases to 5%. A survey of 600 police agencies in 1989, performed by the FBI and the University of Vermont, found not a single case when emotional involvement between the victim and the kidnapper interfered with or jeopardized an assault. In short, this database provides empirical support that the Stockholm syndrome remains a rare occurrence. The sensational nature of dramatic cases causes the public to perceive this phenomenon as the rule rather than the exception. The bulletin concludes that, although depicted in fiction and film and often referred to by the news media, the phenomenon actually occurs rarely. Therefore, crisis negotiators should place the Stockholm syndrome in proper perspective.\n\nIt\u2019s a diagnosis given out by the media, and often serves to make stories easier to digest.",

Not to mention, most people didn't know how to read and translations were often taboo (the Bible printed in a language other than Latin was a big no-no). So even if you had a book you probably couldn't read it or do anything with it.

This is describing events in Palmyra, near Damascus, in 375 AD. \n\nTHE DESTROYERS CAME FROM out of the desert. Palmyra must have been expecting them: for years, marauding bands of bearded, black-robed zealots, armed with little more than stones, iron bars and an iron sense of righteousness, had been terrorizing the east of the Roman Empire. \n\nTheir attacks were primitive, thuggish and very effective. These men moved in packs--later in swarms of as many as five hundred - and when they descended utter destruction followed. Their targets were the temples and the attacks could be astonishingly swift. Great stone columns that had stood for centuries collapsed in an afternoon; statues that had stood\nfor half a millennium had their faces mutilated in a moment; temples that had seen the rise of the Roman Empire fell in a single day.",

That created an interesting mixture of traditions that is still practiced today.\n\nOf course it's all bunk, but it's more interesting bunk than a single religious tradition.",

The types of people that lived in Europe before had diverse spiritual beliefs and cultures. When Christianity spread through the different territories it was used to consolidate power and influence. When the romans spread into Northern Europe they basically committed genocide against countless cultures and people. Many of those cultures respected men and women equally. Leaving a power vacuum that made it that much easier for the faith to spread. Many of the remaining people left in these territories converted out of need to survive and not having the power to protect themselves. My ancestors the Hungarians (Magyars) converted out of need sometime around in the mid to late 900\u2019s. They converted due to being surrounded by different enemies that had a strong alliance. It sad to think what understanding or spiritual depth that evolved with a people was loss or stripped away due to the convenience of the ruling class.",

But with my Black family, it\u2019s not just about the beliefs, it\u2019s about the image, the shame, the history, the community, and so much more. Not to mention I care more about my relationship with my Black family, and again talking back to them doesn\u2019t go over well. Lots of cultures have stricter expectations around respecting elders and respecting your family. It\u2019s not a \u201crandom limitation,\u201d it\u2019s actually how most of the world operates",

Its not mine or any atheists job to go around calling out people for believing in God. That\u2019s what Christians do in reverse. \n\nWhat I will do is be more honest about my atheism with my white family because I don\u2019t care what they think. I care what my Black family thinks for the reasons I mentioned earlier. The expectations are different. \n\nAlso, just like coming out as queer is harder in the Black community so is coming out as an atheist. The fear of rejection is deeper because your family is your identity as a POC, they are your ties to who you are. Unfortunately, many people see blackness and queerness as incompatible, as with atheism and blackness. And so you learn to shut up about the things your community won\u2019t approve or understand because being apart of their community is more important. \n\nIt is gradually changing through generations. But the main point simplified is that white parents are soft. That\u2019s obviously a huge generalization and definitely Is not accurate 100% of the time. But the point I\u2019m trying to make is that talking back to your family or \u201ccalling them out\u201d as you say is seen as incredibly rude and disrespectful. You don\u2019t do that shit.\n\nNot to mention where my family is from in the Caribbean kids are conditioned to have fear in their parents, and that\u2019s passed on through generations. Especially in a culture where women are powerful and sometimes seen as the heads of the house. Growing up I\u2019d get so angry when people would say \u201cwhy don\u2019t you just ask your mom? Why don\u2019t you just tell your parents about this?\u201d Because not everyone\u2019s parents are these post-modern, anti-spanking, open minded people who will let their kids talk to them however they\u2019d like without strict consequences. \n\nSome parents are strict, and you don\u2019t just shrug that off when you start having your own opinions. You take years of therapy and self-reflection to undo all that fear that you\u2019ve had until it doesn\u2019t rule your life so significantly anymore",

I was getting prepared for surgery and just before getting my IV, my nurse mentioned that god will always make sure everything is alright. On the way out, one time, after getting a painful dressing change, one of the staff wanted to give me a link to a video on YouTube. When I asked if it was about the Bible or Christianity, he realized he made a mistake and told me not to worry about it.\n\nIt's annoying to be presumed to be part of any religion, but it's how they're taught. They just think everyone that's friendly or nice must be Christian, because the people that aren't Christian are just nasty sinners bent on destroying the world and everything in it. They get taught that non-Christians are going to attack them and persecute them. When you're not doing those things, you're presumed to be one of them. There's also wishful thinking.

Cool.\n\nPeople from every racial group and sexuality use it as a means of obtaining material benefits and more to this day.  I don't see how the oppression pageant is relevant,  neither of us respect what opinions the book holds, both of us are acknowledging it has been used to justify the mistreatment of people, and both of us are offended by it.\n\nPerhaps that's a strong word, and annoyed would be more appropriate.

Which they still have in India for just one example and i don't see them 'eating babies' because of it\ud83d\ude44(as is the general claim about paganism per the church gossip rumor mill). As far as im concerned christianity is a satanic murder cult/patriarchal form of worship/bigoted hate-fear mongering curse, and i want just about nothing to do with it.

A specific distrust towards Christianity from Americans of African descent is reasonably expected. But that's not the only one of the abrahamic religions to endorse slavery. Judaism, Catholicism/Christians, and Islam all condone slavery and provide outlines on how to maintain and grow your stock of slaves. It doesn't matter if an individual disagrees with slavery, once you accept any one of these terrible ideologies, you must answer for the immorality of slavery in their religious texts/history.",

For example people in US using British imperial measurement units even though America was under British boot and got the independence but still measures things by some British king's bodypart. Take any country or group of people and you will see that were forced to take religion at some point in their history. If that is a way for someone to feel part of community it may not be bad, but people have much more in common than a belief in one common deity (or a lack of belief in one). So, if everyone expects you to also be Christian, in a tight community where everyone is one, then their guess has high chance to be correct. I assume that nobody smokes as I hang out with people who don't.",

They would then spread diseases amongst the local population. \n\nOnce the community started getting sick and dying off they would proclaim that it was due to God punishing them for their beliefs. The only way to save themselves was to pray to god for forgiveness. After a year or so the survivors (less than half the original population) would be converted. Honestly believing that God had saved them. \n\nThen after building a church, they would climb aboard the ship and head over to the next island and enact the same vicious scam all over again. \n\nThey did this until everyone was either christian, catholic or dead. The people of those islands are still to this day highly devoted christians or catholics with not much remaining of their original culture. Makes me sick to my stomach every time I think about it.",

(Or a literal shackle in the case of slavery) without ever stopping to question the beliefs and institutions that that system supported.\n\nI\u2019ve known men who left the church, but still hold patriarchal beliefs of how the man should be in charge of the household, seemingly dropping the \u201cbecause god says so\u201d and nothing else. I\u2019ve even seen slut-shaming and purity culture among seemingly liberated people. Beliefs seemingly so deeply engrained that even when you cut them off at the root they bloom as if generating an energy all their own; Beliefs it no longer occurs to them to question.\n\nI think it\u2019s slightly more understandable in the case of slavery, even as its still sick as hell. In times of strife people will turn to gods and the hope of brighter futures. The promise of heaven is a promise of meaning in suffering because it means the the righteous and obedient sufferers will have a place in heaven. \n\nGenerations of faithful slaves endured unimaginable hardship. Back-breaking labor, abuse, rape. And many of them withstood this in large part because their faith gave them hope. So when slavery ended, many of them could see it as an answer to prayer. (never mind that the answer just happened to come in their generation and not earlier) To reject faith at that point would also have been to accept that all the sorrow, suffering, and pain had truly never been for any good. It would have been like saying that their grandparents who worked until their fingers bleed were fools for expecting to get rewarded in heaven for their sacrifice. It would be to accept that generations of their families died for no reason at all but the cruelty of their masters.\n\nAnd that would have been a huge weight to bear.\n\nIt\u2019s still nauseatingly sick, though. That they kept this evil faith system thrust upon them by their evil masters. But I don\u2019t blame black people for it. Not at all. It\u2019s just a disgusting situation.

Each group making up this mythical monolithic \"White\" was varying histories and cultures. I've also learned, since Birmingham has world-premiere medical schools and research institutions not to assume anything about black people as well. We have Nigerians, people from the Carribeans, North Africans, and folks from all over the US who are black and Muslim, Christian, Atheist, Jewish, etc.\n\nI think you are facing a few things with this. First, the general population is going to make assumptions that all black people are part of a monolithic group. I taught in the MidWest and you'd be surprised how often black colleagues of mine would be asked \"Well how do black people feel about ...\" As if that could be answered by anyone. At best one can only answer \"Here is how one black person (me) feels about it, the rest will differ widely.\" It is a sad truth, but much of our nation (depending on where you are) has very little experience with any people of color. I think Trump capitalized on this in his 2016 election.\n\nSecond, while I'm also a Christian, I have plenty of friends, family, and people I care for who are atheist. I know them to be among the most ethical and moral people I know, especially when their atheism is an active one. They act morally because it is good and moral and not under the threat of damnation. I also know they have to deal with the bullshit of \"how can you be good if you don't believe in God?\"\n\nI understand it is frustrating, and I can only apologise for myself. I hear you, and I know it sucks. Stay strong. Eventually, I hope, we will have a world where people can believe or not and be of any color or background.\n\nIf it is any consolation, my wife's family  (who are Christian Arabs) are sometimes assumed to to be Muslim.

Statistically it's a safe bet.\n\nWhy would you choose that religion?  I dunno, because you're ignorant and indoctrinated?  Religion is arguably not a choice since it's supposed to be based on belief.  I'm not religious, so I don't get it;  maybe we should ask some of the black ministers who have made fortunes and gained political power through their connection to the church, the same way ministers from other racial groups do.\n\nAnyone with modern sensibilities should find slavery abhorrent.  Black people do not have a special right to be outraged by religion, or by the fact that it was used to justify the American slave trade.  That is a repugnant state of affairs that should offend absolutely everyone.  It isn't any more absurd for a black person to be a christian than anyone else.",

Your family tree was cut off from their belief systems and taught an edited version of the bible that focused on biblical endorsement of slavery and how they should look to religion for strength, and that was forced on them until Stockholm Syndrome kicked in and they accepted their new normal. In the 1860's, once freed, most didn't recognize the oppression in the religion. It was the source of their strength and hope. Their prayers were being answered. Free at last, more or less, much less than more. When your life is as hard and hopeless as what they lived through, any source of hope is precious, so they kept up the christian traditions and followed that lifestyle long after the yoke was removed. It's gonna take many decades to break all those chains, but fortunately the chain breaker is access to information, and the internet is the tool for the job.\n\nThis is why China keeps their internet so locked down.

Watch Matt Dillahunty absolutely break down the bs arguments people hide behind to pretend the Bible isn't pro slavery.\n\nBe well, nice chatting with you and I'll leave you with these, because I am just cherry picking...\n\n\"Slaves, obey your earthly masters with deep respect and fear.  Serve them sincerely as you would serve Christ.\" (Ephesians 6:5 NLT)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Christians who are slaves should give their masters full respect so that the name of God and his teaching will not be shamed.  If your master is a Christian, that is no excuse for being disrespectful.  You should work all the harder because you are helping another believer by your efforts.  Teach these truths, Timothy, and encourage everyone to obey them.\" (1 Timothy 6:1-2 NLT)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"However, you may purchase male or female slaves from among the foreigners who live among you.  You may also purchase the children of such resident foreigners, including those who have been born in your land.  You may treat them as your property, passing them on to your children as a permanent inheritance.  You may treat your slaves like this, but the people of Israel, your relatives, must never be treated this way.\" (Leviticus 25:44-46 NLT)",

I mess up sometimes but I really try to talk to people on reddit as I would if they were sitting next to me in person.\n\nMy issues with religions are vast but to give a bit of perspective I've been fortunate to travel and live in many places around the world. To believe in a religion that says an agnostic atheist like myself, a tribe in the Amazon living peacefully in the Amazon go to hell as they don't worship the right sky daddy is a requires a deeply disturbing level of narcissism. Also, what a sad and pathetic god.\n\nIf the god of the Bible (or many other religions) turns out to be true instead of being sorta apathetic to this being I will be hostile towards it. The concept that you have to worship another being means they are a sociopath, not a savior.\n\nIt's the same reason I think people who believe in Karma are being naive. Take Ethiopia with he oldest Christian churches on earth (I think). How many Christian children have to starve to death on gods watch?\n\nAnother aspect to major world religions that gives them validation of truth and exposes them as false at the same time to me. For instance Christianity stole the trinity concept, repurposed the winter equinox as Christmas and the great flood story. I do believe the great flood did happen when an astroid hit earth 12,000 years ago which is another topic but it does show the value of old texts.\n\nAs for the King James Version one could argue that is the ultimate expression of cherry picking. Men (not-gods) wrote these \"holy\" books and men (not gods) edited them over the centuries.\n\nWho knows but maybe the James Webb Telescope will provide some proof of our origins or aliens, it'll be fascinating to see how religions manipulate and approach that evidence.\n\n\"If the person offering salvation is also the person threatening you with punishment, it's not really salvation. It's terrorism and extortion.\" - Micheal Sherlock\n\nI have issues with atheist Matt Dillahunty but again if you really wanna have the position that the Bible isn't pro slavery and wanna challenge your faith, go down the wormhole. Thanks again for the kind words.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4-5AV59RWQ&list=PL\\_FWOCPqTWWAdmje0keJtyeAjRMmmsnxt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4-5AV59RWQ&list=PL_FWOCPqTWWAdmje0keJtyeAjRMmmsnxt)",

Too many people can\u2019t disconnect the association of Christianity from America or white people and more often then not people mistake culture for religion and that\u2019s especially the case with Muslim faith. People display faith differently across the world. A Christian Australian family may express their faith extremely differently compared to a Christian Spanish family, consider their holidays, christmases even, there\u2019s differences and that extends into how people treat and view religion and especially if they decide to try to get people to join, how pushy can they be? Will they only give a small question or a big speech on why you should join? Do they care? Christianity and religion in general is not one big consolidated idea, it is adaptive to the people that follow it and \u201cpicking and choosing\u201d what to follow from religious texts isn\u2019t an insult, if anything it can be encouraged. Now more than ever religious stereotypes are becoming more and more invalid and people are seeing that which is great, not every Christian white man is well off with a secret hate for gays, not every Muslim woman wears a hijab and thinks divorce is illegal/against faith. \n\n\nPeople are not their religions.",

And the very ugly truth is that people who join a church while in emotional distress do not usually become long-term members.  \n\nAlmost all active Christians are born into Christianity.  That is one reason churches are in trouble in the US.  They drove away a lot of millennials.  Now the millennials who were driven away are not raising their kids Christian.  The kids of the millennials who did stay in the church are now being driven away.  \n\nAnother problem churches are having is that religious couples are having fewer children.  Historically churches have lost 25% - 50% of the children born into the religion.  That means to maintain themselves they need families to have 3 or 4 kids in order to keep 2.    Generational attrition has increased while family size has gone down.  That is a fatal combination for churches unless there are not a lot of people moving into the area.",
