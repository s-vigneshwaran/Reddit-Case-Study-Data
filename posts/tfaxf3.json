A little off topic but same thing with white privilege. We all have privileges. Male, female, Asian, white, black, etc. So it gets really annoying when all they bring up is male privilege but act like women don't have a shit load of privileges too. I swear I have never heard the term \"female privilege\" or \"black privilege\" in my life.",
