For example, let\u2019s say being a cashier is only $5/hr but you insist on paying him $15, you just destroy 2 jobs.

                                                  "text": "Ok, got it. Here is my response to your points:\n\n(1) You are absolutely correct that people will rely on govt assistance than taking a job that doesn't provide a livable wage. Isn't the minimum wage a government assistance too? People would rather take a min. wage job that pays $15 than improving their skills/knowledge. Why study and graduate college just to get a job that pays $20-25 when you can ditch school, smoke weed all day, and still get paid $15/hr at a mindless job that literally only requires you to show up and stand there. Minimum wage is practically destroying people's incentive to not suck in life. \n\n(2) Which takes us to your second point about the cause of the Great Resignation. Let's define it first - people who move to a better job is not part of this movement because trying to get better job is natural and happens all the time. As for people who simply quit their jobs, they didn't quit because they realized their jobs suck. They already knew their jobs sucked, but they couldn't find better ones as they are simply not competitive in the work place. Blessed with a pandemic that gave them (1) no rent/mortgage, (2) likely 3-4x higher income while doing nothing, and (3) forbearance on debts such as student loans and car payments, they came into a little sum of money. Let's just do the math, if somebody makes $10/hr, during the pandemic he was getting paid about $4,000/month from unemployment instead of $1,600. He likely also decided to give his landlord the middle finger since there's eviction moratorium, so that's about $1,000/month. All these people just lucked into about $61-80k of free money during these 2 years. They are so bad in financial literacy they actually think having $60-80k in your bank means means you are financially free. They just don't know any better, and this is why I said that all these lower level workers will come back to work. Once the money runs out, they will come back. \n\n(3) Regarding your wage demarcation line: it's sad to say this, but most people's job are so meaningless they won't find it meaningful regardless of how much you pay them. Paying a McD cashier $100/k year won't make him find meaning in life. In fact, he's a McD cashier so he's low on education and intelligence, so he will just early out and decide work the minimum number of hours that will support his life style of playing video game and/or smoking weed. \n\n(4) People who actually work in meaningful careers and/or are ambitious don't need the minimum wage. I worked at a minimum wage job before - when I was in high school. Ambitious, enterprising people will improve themselves. You don't have to worry about them being underpaid. \n\n(5) Only useless (I mean this in the literal not judgmental sense, e.g. somebody who can't do basic math or write a coherent paragraph) and uneducated people will work those minimum wage level jobs. These people didn't put in the work during their childhood to become useful, so incentivizing them with minimum wage will only make this problem persist longer. Jobs like janitors, cashiers, etc. will eventually be replaced by technology anyways, why do we incentivize these mindless jobs? Economics is all about incentives, so let's incentivize the right careers. Why don't we use the resources towards making med school and science PHd programs free?",

The reason I keep bringing up the great Resignation is not because it's happening, it's because of the SCALE. so on that end, you HAVE to count the people leaving one job and going into a new sector of work. A lost worker is still going to be felt by businesses no matter if they transfer. The scale of this happening right now should be an indicator of something not being right in the job market. \n\n2. Unfortunately those people who fall on the bottom end of society NEED purpose. A huge part of why people turn to living life as a criminal or leech is because of that lack of meaning. You can't just not consider them in society because you'll soon have a crime issue on your hands. Crime definitely hurts business. This is why I think in an ideal situation, even if minimum wage is higher than normal it's beneficial because then most those people who are just stuck at the bottom don't just struggle because poverty and crime have a close relationship. There's some placating you'll have to do just to keep people from feeling like their lives are meaningless AND being broke because that's not a good place to be, especially long term. \n\nYou're definitely right that to some extent we can't account for everyone, but to maintain a stable society we can't just ignore those on the bottom either. Frankly the wage issue is something I didn't want to get into, because I think this is only ONE part of it, and the other ties into inflation and spending. Stuff that I'm not prepared to discuss.",

Several fall completely apart when reading in a language/translation that predates the KJV. 1Cor 6:9 in the German bible from 1545 (& before) doesn\u2019t use the word homosexual or anything close to it. It says \u201cchild abuser\u201d or child \u201crapist\u201d\u2026.VERY different thing\u2026unless you automatically equate adult same-sex relationships to child rape. Likewise Lev 18-22 in the German bible from 1545 (again that predates KJV & all derivative English bibles) roughly says \u201cdon\u2019t f*ck little boys in your wife\u2019s bed\u2026\u201d It\u2019s also worth noting that translating the Hebrew \u201cto\u2019evah\u201d as \u201cabomination\u201d is intentionally misleading when it\u2019s more closely related to something being \u201cunsanitary\u201d.\n\nDogma & agenda gave us the queer hating bible\u2026but really only since the Bible was translated into English.",

Literally have a backhoe come in and collect all the old concrete pour it into a pulverizer and then you can use it as new cement and new concrete.... \n\n\nHow did so many people get red pill into thinking that concrete isn't renewable I'm so confused. Oh it's made by plants and the Earth is 10% cement.... There is not a chance in a million years of trees being more renewable than concrete... Alone all the work gas and fuel it takes to cut down a tree put it into boards cut those right put those on the truck and move them to location. \n\n\nTo wear concrete can just be used over again...",

I didn\u2019t \u201cact all crazy\u201d or imply it was the \u201cend of the world.\u201d  I even posted an explanatory follow up specifically pointing out this fact.  \n\nOp original comment made me laugh and that laugh woke the baby up.  Big deal, he went back to sleep.\n\nA week later though I\u2019m still getting messages from people without babies, one could say also they are people against babies in fact, whining that parents complain about loud noises when nobody did.\n\nI have noticed a trend though.

Timber is typically Grown where nothing else can. No irrigation, very rural isolated areas without any agriculture infrastructure at all. Steep hillsides. It also requires very little inputs once it's planted. Can done in more sustainable ways (obviously tons of countries and companies still not doing this). When selectively and perpetually harvested, it can support a diverse ecosystem. Hemp is Grown in massive monocrops which don't support any other species. And I'm not completely against Hemp BTW, I actually grow Hemp and THC cannabis for a living. But the way people claim Hemp is gonna save the world is an overexaggeration",

Graham claimed it was hypocritical for an environmentalist to chop down trees and build things out of wood. When the activist responded that trees are a sustainable source of building materials because they can be regrown, Graham claimed it was equally possible to \"grow concrete\".

My apologies if it came off that way.\n\nIt also may be entirely true that on the average, leftist viewpoints tend to be more aligned with reality than those of conservatives. I personally believe that this is probably the case. My point is simply that I don't believe most people on the left necessarily deserve credit for that, and I think the Rittenhouse case is one example of why they don't deserve credit.

I am trained in polite discussions and I'm the top mediator in the entire neighborhood. You are worth more to me than just another target. I hope we will come to have a friendship never before seen on this Earth. Don't you think you might be hurting someone's feelings saying that over the internet? Think about it, my friend. As we speak I am contacting my good friends across the USA and your P.O. box is being traced right now so you better prepare for the greeting cards, friend. The greeting cards that help you with your hate. You should look forward to it, friend. I can be anywhere, anytime for you, and I can calm you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my chess set. Not only am I extensively trained in conflict resolution, but I have access to the entire group of my friends and I will use them to their full extent to start our new friendship. If only you could have known what kindness and love your little comment was about to bring you, maybe you would have reached out sooner. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now we get to start a new friendship, you unique person. I will give you gifts and you might have a hard time keeping up. You're finally living, friend.",

Oh and plants also produce limestone which produces more cement and concrete literally the plants petrifying in the ground produce limestone so the same trees are producing limestone that's why you don't want to cut the trees down cuz they can produce more limestone thus building stronger and more energy efficient houses and houses that are easier to recycle.....\n\n\nPlease all of you tell me what drugs you're on\n\n\n\nWood doesn't last as long so wood houses have to be replaced that's more trees cut down more gas being spent cutting down said trees milling the trees and moving the trees to the location... \n\n\nTo wear a concrete building could be polarized on the spot report into a new house and they can move on to the next one... See how it's way less gas involved and energy just building the homes and moving of the material... How did all of you get red pill into some b******* so easily.",

He\u2019s already a shithead besides this case, but to have someone who would so clearly be biased commenting on the case, and presenting him as someone impartial, is such a *bafflingly* terrible decision and yet somehow not surprising when it\u2019s the BBC. \n\nSo no, I wouldn\u2019t say they\u2019re doing a good job just because the right sometimes gets offended when they\u2019re not being racist enough.",

School children round the world rejoice as the tinfoil peels off the plastic container and their spoons disappear into the opaque, mildly flavored, jiggly void. There's not a single sad face as they lick the packaging clean of the marvelous, vaguely chemically scented slime that remains in a thin coat. If Yorkshire pudding can inspire the same level of self destructive commitment that the Snack Pack company has created then it may call itself pudding. Much like the sugar nuke that is bread pudding. While not a viscous, opaque jelly; the level of harm a single bite of bread pudding can cause to a full grown man is astonishing. I've seen many a heart stopped and families torn asunder by the syrup drenched, carb heaven of bread pudding. Be better Yorkshire pudding and start deliciously murdering people with impulse control issues. I believe in you.",

Or when you hit dodge and he immediately dodged? Because I sure as fuck didn't. It was just...working the way it should. It's bullshit artificial difficulty. That's all it is. You have openings and windows and parries you have to time in a game like Nioh as well....it's just FAIR about it. That's the difference.  I'm not calling for FromSoft to incorporate something as in depth as Nioh 2 does with it's skills or stances or abilities like that game. All I want them to do is get rid of the decade plus move que system already and make it so the button you push is what immediately happens on screen. That's fucking it. That's really all I'm asking for.",

Can you say the same about any political sub?\n\nI get it, people are frustrated and scared and feel like they\u2019re without agency. Reddit communities offer the illusion of action because you have so many people being talking about their shared frustrations. \n\nBut talk ISN\u2019T action and there isn\u2019t a single thing AW or LSC has done to actually make the real world a better place. It\u2019s funny that those sites lament that culture wars distract from the \u201cclass war\u201d when they are doing nothing more than what\u2019s part group therapy and part LARPing as revolutionaries. \n\nI don\u2019t even think that\u2019s anyone\u2019s fault - the real mistake is not understanding that by default a subreddit is not designed to actually facilitate action because the people on the sub believe participating in it amounts to action. \n\nIt\u2019s not - it\u2019s just preaching to a very loud choir.",

They build up the sugar, but also oxidize it when they consume/use it. That is being referred to as plant cell respiration. So plants also need oxygen to some degree and release CO2.\n\nSometimes, plants actually even release more CO2 than what they capture. That is the the case for trees which are in climate zones with winter as a season for example, but also during very hot summers. Basically it comes down to what we consider to be \"stress\" for the tree.\n\nThe plant parts that don't produce oxygen (so everything but the leaves - stem, roots etc.) consume more oxygen than they produce. That is also why you can \"drown\" some plants when you fill up the pots with water. The roots simply \"drown\". This is a major reason why NASA and the US military are actually looking at aeroponics (water vapor) as an alternative to hydroponics by the way.\n\nHolland is actually exporting a lot of vegetables from their greenhouses. They are using a very interesting system divergent from those mentioned above. They use covered stone wool (yes, it is really made from stone) with regular water flow intervals. That is because aero- and hydroponics have a downside: The larger the plant becomes, the slower it can take in nutrients with the roots, because the roots under the plants usually just hang down in a big lump/pigtail of roots. This decreases the surface are of the roots and the roots on the inside start to rot, endangering the other roots through growth of potentially harmful bacteria. The stone wool enables the plant roots to spread out while being supported. A focus for future crop plant selection in the future could be thicker roots. Salad will still grow fine, because it grows so fast though.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I just thought this could be interesting to know.\n\nI don't agree with Goal\\_Posts. A certain amount of the absorbed carbon stays in the ground.",

Probably a better ratio for softwoods and worse for hardwoods, but I'm not a forester.\n\nIt's not a math issue really. People have a misconception that trees hold incredible amounts carbon forever, and it's simply not true. They die and rot, and that process makes CO2 and methane. \n\nWe need a way to make that carbon into something lasting, not mulch, no matter if it comes from the trunk or the branches. We can probably use plants to capture carbon for us, but it's likely that we will need to process it somehow before it's stable enough not to just turn back into CO2 in a few decades.",

In a mole (just a really big number in chemistry, akin to a dozen) of CO2 there's 12 grams of carbon and 32 grams of oxygen. The tree stores the carbon, but not nearly as much oxygen, so only 27% of the weight of CO2 is kept in the tree. And the hydrogen that ends up in the hydrocarbons is incredibly light, only weighing one gram per mole, so the resulting tree growth is mainly carbon.\n\nAdding in all the other nutrients and stuff a trees dry weight is 50% carbon. Google says dry wood weighs 730kg per m^3\n\nSo we can assume then 365kg of carbon in a cubic meter. Since carbon is 27% of the mass of CO2, 365kg of carbon takes 1350kg of CO2 to get\n\nNow for the comment you just replied to about burning, the same logic applies in reverse \n\nThe 365kg of carbon would react with oxygen from the atmosphere to make 1350kg of CO2",

          "text": "Just want to bring some clarity to this because there are a couple of errors, and also the way it\u2019s presented could be misleading.\n\nFirst, Portland cement production alone (not as concrete or other materials) is responsible for about 8% of global CO2 emission.\nSince cement is a key ingredient of concrete this, on paper, sounds very bad.\n\nHowever, this CO2 comes from two sources: (1) CO2 chemically lost from the burning of calcium carbonate carbonate. (2) the burning of fuel required for this manufacturer no process..\n\nAfter the cement has set, it actually reabsorbs CO2 that lost chemically to reform calcium carbonate - making it a cyclical reaction. This takes many years (decades) but it\u2019s recently been estimated that this carbon sink effect will reduce the net total amount CO2 emissions produced by cement production by 30%.\n\nSo it\u2019s not as bad, but it\u2019s still not great. So for decades academics and researchers in the cement industry have been experimenting with different additions to act as partial cement replacements - historically these have been waste products from coal and steel plants - to the point there is very little concrete manufactured now that doesn\u2019t make use of an existing waste product, (a) because it\u2019s cheaper and (b) because it\u2019s better for the environment.\nThere\u2019s also been decades of research into optimising mix designs to reduce the cement requirement of concrete.\n\nNow, all the begs the question: why don\u2019t we use other materials instead of concrete?\nWell, the bottom line is we can\u2019t. There are too many things that can\u2019t be built with other materials or, if they could, would be significantly more expensive and just as bad or worse for the environment.\n\nFor example, even if you do replace all the concrete construction that could be replaced by timber, you would have to defrost and area *the size of India*\u2026 *every single year*.  Clearly that would be less sustainable than just using concrete.\n\n\nSo at the end of the day we need to do two things:\n(1) We need to continue to optimise cement and concrete production to be the most efficient and least wasteful.\n(2) use alternative \u201cgreener\u201d materials in concrete\n(3) stop tearing down existing buildings that can be retrofitted.",

What I don't know is if it takes more rain to produce new timber, or to maintain existing trees. and if it does take more rainfall to keep regrowing a forest l does that effect the water table negatively.

The energy usage of irrigation is also quite low. Because nobody wants to waste energy costing them money. Most places in the world a solar panel produces more than enough power to irrigate more than a hectare.\n\nIrrigating isn't a bad thing as long as you're using the proper sustainable practises. I would know, i have to get permits for it.\n\nThose rules were mainly made up to make it seem like cows used thousands of liters of water to make a kg of beef. It's clever use of statistics to make something seem worse that it is. However by those metrics chocolate uses 17m3 water per Kg 2m3 more than beef.",

Growing a tree, cutting it down, building something, and using the space where the tree was to grow more trees is a pretty good way to trap carbon.",

Both concrete and wood can be 100% recycled, however a lower % of wood is actually recycled because it is harder to separate mechanically than concrete. When you separate concrete you also pull out stone, brick, and mortar which can all be recycled together. When you separate wood you also pull out plastic and treated wood which typocally can't be recycled with the kiln dried white wood. In theory you can recycle all wood but in reality a good portion of it is landfilled. \n\nI work for a wood recycling company and am in charge of research to find the best new tech for recycling wood.",

                                  "text": "This reply us such a mixed bag.  So, first, let me just start by saying there are some people that are saying \"he/his\" because they honestly didn't know Doreen goes by \"she/her\" but there have also been scores of people that have been using this whole thing as an opportunity to be transphobic and purposely use \"he\" (or \"her\" in quotation marks for no reason other than being sarcastic/snide) when referring to Doreen, insisting others use \"he/his\" in reference to her, and/or otherwise incorrecting people.  I wasn't quite sure which case you fell under, but, from the phrasing of your previous comment, thought it might have been the latter.\n\nWith that said though, there are still multiple other aspects of your reply that I feel are off base and suggest a less than flattering idea of how you may view people.  Cleaning ones room, fixing ones hair, and putting on a dress doesn't make or break being/presenting female.  Hell, if anything, on average, most woman I known have had messier rooms/homes than the average guy I know.  Also, transitioning can be a long and expensive process.  Not everybody can afford the medication/procedures that help with presenting as one wishes to and, even if they can, can take time to produce results.\n\nFinally, I definately agree that Doreen should have presented herself in a more presentable/less casual/unkempt fashion and, more importantly, been more prepared if she had any hope of being taken seriously by a majority of the people that would be viewing the interview.  She also should not have allowed herself the be presented as representing the antiwork subreddit given that (from what I've heard), they voted against accepting interviews.",

He has always worked for right leaning newspapers in the UK and hosted a show on TalkSport (usually known as TalkShite) which has a very \"laddy\" style to it. Left leaning sports pundits left TalkSport when it was bought by the same company who own The S*n newspaper (Murdoch's group). Mike Graham did not and continued to host a show called The Two Mike's where him and fellow moron Mike Parry (look up cinnamon challenge Mike Parry for more) chatted shit between the hours of 1am and 4am each day.\n\nHe is an absolute idiot, but sometimes does things like this because he's literally only bothered about engagement. He doesn't care if he's wrong. He only cares about his profile. He is a grifter and is universally disliked.",

In the US people tend to watch one news source (CNN or Fox), or only news sources from one side, some of the slightly smarter people watch a little bit of the the other side, but not nearly enough. This one sidedness leads to the division and social uproar you see in the US on the news. This stuff is also the exact reason why so many people in this comment section are blaming the other viewpoint for this idiocy, or exaggerating the stupidity of the other side. The view of conservatives or liberals as all bad by either side is dangerous and wrong. \n\nEdit: I got a little bit sidetracked from the actual question.

I mean, I despise being grouped in with either liberal or conservative, but the best way to describe me would just be right-wing. I think a lot of people there are stupid, though. Anyhow, it seems to me that you're doing the same thing the host is doing. Trying to form a narrative and keep the blame on the people you don't agree with? Also, do the liberals not do the same thing you accuse conservatives of doing? They're all dumb, and need to figure out what a compromise is, like, 4 years ago.",

I'm gonna ignore this dude said you can \"grow concrete\" because I don't have the patience to deal with such idiocy. The point is, even if he was right, he is still wrong.\n\nOn a personal note, I don't think that cutting trees to build will be a problem until we start building entire cities of the thing, and for some reason I am not too worried about that. Call me naive. Instead, the problem with deforestation is that they cut stuff down to plant a single type of plant, be it palm trees or corn, effectively changing the ecosystem and having widespread ramifications.\n\nall in all, this dude planting a tree to cut it later isn't killing the planet.

Hence why California is constantly dealing with forest fires due to the laws over there making it more difficult to actually cut down and harvest the wood from these trees.\n\nFurthermore these companies that do this are also constantly replanting these trees after they cut them down so it's not like they're just leaving the land to rot or anything they are constantly replanting these trees so that they can regrow. It's more beneficial to have these lumbering companies doing this since the alternative is probably just someone buying the land cutting down a crap ton of trees and just building a high way on that land and then none of the trees regrow.",

Subsistence farming is responsible for 48% of deforestation; commercial agriculture is responsible for 32%.) Other reasons are desertification, land degradation and wild fires.\n\nCommercial forestry as done in the northern hemisphere uses the same land over and over and over again. Chop down the largest 5% of the trees, wait a year, chop down the largest 5% of the trees, wait a year ....You dont chop down everything and then wait 20 years to chop again. Its not a crop field were you harvest everything down and then wait for new season. Instead you generate a permanent flow of wood. At the same time the bio mass of the forest stays basically the same (+5% -5% +5% -5% ...) so there is also the same amount of CO2 bound in the forest at any given time.",

With concrete, you grade the earth and mix it up with all it's ingredients and form it. Water will evaporate throughout 500 years but all it's components are reused, always.

And the reason why it\u2019s sustainable is because only those which are at the certain size and age are cut down and the rest are left to grow even further and the amount cut is compensated by planting more than the amount cut. And Im pretty sure they only grow select trees that doesnt take more than half a decade to be eligible for cutting.",

Lol you do know lands are leveled, forests are cut, and massive quarries are dug just so that rocks/stones that are used for construction can be gathered? And what happens if more needs rocks to grind? Get more rocks?\n\nAnd fyi a massive amount of land is also cleared to give way to enough hemp fields needed to gather materials for construction which defeats your argument. Almost all types of material production are at least destructive to nature one way or another. \n\nThe point is we try to make the most efficient, reliable, strong, long lasting, regrowable and least destructive material there is which the person being interviewed pointed out by promoting sustainable tree cutting, a process of only cutting the needed amount of trees for construction which concrete cant do since majority of the material gathered to make it are not regrowable\u2026",
