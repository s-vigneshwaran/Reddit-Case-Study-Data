The soviets launched one single amphib assault against one poorly defended island as a trial run using 60 US-supplied boats and got their asses kicked. A mainland landing would have been a slaughter. And, of course, the soviets were not exactly reticent about killing civilians indiscriminately, even if we ignore the fact of Japanese civilian combatants. \n\nYou're correct about the hopes for a soviet-mediated surrender, but you have the effect of its loss reversed. Everything I've seen and read indicated it would have (and did) strengthen their resolve and inspire them to fight further. The nukes themselves are what terrified Hirohito so much - the concept that his nation and culture could be annihilated in hours from the air.",

That is changing though. You also have a misconception about how Japan was rebuilt. \n\nJapan was not Germany post WW2. In Germany, there was always an anti hitler faction. That faction glad accepted American money to rebuild Germany. \n\nJapan was different. Everyone in Japan was fanatically supporting the war effort. I mean they were training mothers to use bamboo spears in case of US invasion of the mainland. When they were defeated it crushed an incredibly proud people. So the Japanese refused to be bought of by the people who \u201ccrushed their nation\u201d however they took every bit of technical knowledge we offered. That\u2019s why several modern management styles (Kaizen/JIT materials/bottom-up management/quality first focus) originate from Japan and why Toyota and Honda are household names. It\u2019s also why Americans were concerned about japans economy overtaking the US\u2019s in the 70\u2019s/80\u2019s",

Perry demands they open up trading ports to the US\n\n3. American (and other Western) people and money flood into Japan, as trade is opened up. \n\n4. Over the next 50 years Japan would extensively reorganise it's industry and military. 1873 they began to recruit through conscription. Causing riots amongst the samurai class.\n\n5. In 1889 the set up a parliamentary government system, very similar to the US system. 2 houses and the Emporer at the top. Not unlike the HOR, Senate, President. \n\n6. Then Japan beings it's expansionist saber ratling. Including an invasion of China and annexation of parts of Korea. \n\n7. First War happens. Japan takes loads of islands the Germans held in the Pacific. They recieve them in the end of war peace agreement. \n\n8. Emboldened Japan continues it's military build up and when WW2 breaks out they see a great opportunity to further their territory and power in the region. They invade China, Vietnam, and other parts Asia. \n\n9. America is dragged into the war BY Japan, and they're large Western style military. Japan attacks the US because Japan want more regional power which they feel they can't have if the US is still a major player in the Pacific.\n\n10. A few years later, 2 nukes, surrender and return to a pre-war western style economic model. \n\nIt's very abridged I'll grant you. And they didn't invaded the Phillipines until '43. But they copied they're style of army, economy and government on the American system after Perry forced them to open the country. \n\nIf you had read my comment you'd have seen explicitly said \"while not officially a colony Japan a lot of modern japan's structures are based on American ones.\" So I had already acknowledged that there wasn't a true colonial connection. They were shaped,  supported and often exploited like a colony. Until after WW1 at least.\n\n\nAnd you made sure we know the terribly long and dry documentaries you watch so you must be super knowledgeable.",

I appreciate the link. \n\nIt does seem there is some disagreement and it is not clear cut that this meeting to devalue to the dollar is a contributing factor the Japanese asset bubble, it may have been a contributing factor yet not the only factor. There does not seem to be any intentional policy of the US to \"make it commit economic suicide\", this would also not be in the favour of the US.\n\nAs for it being a \"dumb policy\" economic markets are very unpredictable when attempting to forge future policies. The change of this policy 2 years later does not make it a \"dumb policy\" yet one that may have not played out as expected. A reversal and change in tact seemed like a wise choice. Hindsight provides us with the ability to see what did happen, yet at the time many big business players seemed to agree it was the best way forward for all parties concerned to strengthen trading relationships with allies in the context of the Cold War.",

The food is amazing, people are usually friendly and most things you\u2019d need as a tourist are straight forward and accessible to people who don\u2019t speak the language. A friend of mine took a half year off to do work and travel in Australia and he and his friend went to Japan for the last 2 weeks, neither of them speak any Japanese or are interested in it as weebs, and they got through pretty easily.\n\nThe issue with Japan is once you try to settle there everything becomes a huge pile of beaurocracy, people can be openly racist if they know you\u2019re trying to move there and I\u2019ve even heard of someone who got a teaching job there (basically the most common occupation for foreigners) being thrown out because their native colleagues basically formed a conspiracy against them and reported them to their boss so they got kicked out.\n\nIt\u2019s basically an entirely different setting from when you\u2019re a tourist, like they\u2019ll endure you for a week or two but wouldn\u2019t want you to actually stay there.",

Its way harder to get a working visa than a travel visa in basically any country. \n\nThe people are really nice usually, I used to live in Shanghai so I've been to Japan a couple of times. Spoke no Japanese but could get along with english for the most part. \n\nHowever I have friends who worked in Japan as a foreigner, and its a lot more difficult. People stare on public transport, it's hard to get anything done, and Japanese government and banks are incredibly inefficient in terms of getting anything approved.",

I could think of a few things we could do about the problem that I'm highlighting here - the fact that 13/52 statistics only seem to come out of the mouths of people who, believe it or not, don't support things like \"criminal justice reform,\" \"police oversight,\" or \"addressing inequity and poverty\" as solutions to the problem, but rather, \"deport/segregate/exterminate blacks.\" These same people ignore the overwhelming bodies of evidence that show that a black person committing a crime is a lot more likely than a white person committing a crime to be, A: Pursued by police, B: Caught, C: Prosecuted, and D: Incarcerated. All of this is on top of the fact that we barely manage to solve half of all homicides in the country. \n\n  Anyone who ignores the facts that oppose the legitimacy and integrity of the 13/52 viewpoint, but still touts that \"something has to be done,\" is coming from a pretty obvious position of bad faith. This is the problem I'm highlighting. And although no person in the history of ever has been required to pose a solution to a problem to be capable of recognizing a problem in legitimate discourse, I posit that the solution to the problem would be to eliminate white supremacy and the deceptive oversimplification of statistics they use to manipulate the minds of weak, uninformed persons. I'm not going to be surprised when you disagree.",

You have to think there were 5 million people when the first census happened and we know poor people make more babies than rich people. The next aspect that is probably skewing those numbers is more complicated. First off the last literal slave didn't get freed till 1942. Then Nixon wasnt able to make being black or a hippy illegal so he targeted them through the drug war. ~~1/4 black men are in jail right now.~~ I just checked the black incarceration rate has dropped so fast that that no longer applies. We are just seeing the end of the war on black people and hippies. I do think black people live in and have existed in conditions in america that lead to more crimes per capita.  However this statistic is disingenuous and just promotes racism without explain the complex and tragic history black people have had in in America.",

Less than five minutes from my place of work someone purchased the confederate monuments the city took down and made a park for people to BBQ at...like complete with an entry gate that says \"CSA\" on it. They regularly rotate the 20ft confederate flags they have on a flag pole flying above it (sometimes it is the battle flag, sometimes the stars and bars, etc).\n\nI have lived here off and on my entire life and compared to places like NYC and SF (where i have also lived) the racism is off the charts. At my last place of employment I would hear racist comments multiple times a day from customers and a few employees we had. The last day I worked there, a customer literally said out loud in the lobby that if he had it his way \"we'd be doing shit like the holocaust again, only this time we'd put the liberals in there as well. Line em up and shoot em in the back of the head\".\n\nGTFO with that \"noble south\" bullshit. The people here are just as rude as anywhere else, but with less education and cartoonish levels of racism.",

Racism is a state of mind. Seeing more minorities does not make communities more racist, it makes them less racist as they interact with other races and realize that racist stereotypes are wrong more often than not. [This is an observed fact.](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/people_in_more_diverse_countries_are_less_prejudiced)\n\nIt is literally a fact that locations with more diversity are less prejudiced. \n\nNo matter how much you repeat your smooth brain takes, the data shows that diversity is correlated with *less* racism.\n\n[Another article talking about a study coming to the same conclusion.](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/white-people-become-less-racist-just-by-moving-to-more-diverse-areas-study-finds-9166506.html?amp)\n\n\u201cOur results clearly show that districts with the most mixing between ethnic groups lead to the highest reductions in racial prejudice. Although our recent longitudinal studies were conducted in Germany, there is no reason to believe that these effects would not be the same across the world. The cross-sectional studies conducted in England, the US, and South Africa certainly support this idea,\u201d Professor Hewstone said.\n\nYou think diversity is a catalyst for racism? A longitudinal study is one in which individuals are measured across time. They found that the individuals that lived in locales that became more diverse across time also became less prejudiced themselves across that timespan.",

Often can be less hateful and slightly more innocent out of sheer ignorance. But unfortunately often pop culture is all certain cultures learn about black folks and of someone has only seen like 90s movies where are black folks are gangster rappers, they tend to think of black folks as gangsters.\n\nI've known black folks who have traveled to countries that, generally speaking, don't really have black folks. They've basically all said it's a wild experience. It's still racism but it's totally fucking different than American racism. It's fear of the unknown versus targeted malice based on centuries of propaganda",

As someone who is currently immigrating to Canada from the US, it isn't a cheap process. Immigrants from dirt poor countries tend to be the wealthier people from those countries. You're probably thinking about refugees. Refugees tend to be poorer and leave countries out of desperation. These people tend to be poorer and tend to have difficulty succeeding in their destination. I'll be honest, your perception of immigrants isn't what happens in reality. People who immigrate to the states for economic opportunity tend to have the means to do so. Those who immigrate out of desperation tend to either fail to get into the US or even if they get in, face discrimination for generations (think of the Irish and Italians at the turn of the century, or the Chinese in the 19th century). This trend only gets stronger as our immigration systems get more strict",

When 99% of of opportunities go to white people for the majority of history, why do you focus on the small cultural changes to turn that 99% opportunity for white people to something... More equal?\n\nAnd if you go \"it's unfair because we all have had to work to get to where we are\", let it be known that systemic racism and treatment of black people have HISTORICALLY prevented them from achieving opportunities, thus disallowing them from passing on their achievements to their successors. Thus, affirmative action is argued to be make amends for a fairer system because their historical oppression is intergenerational, and thus needs to be remediated, as the argument exists that despite their lack of wealth to access opportunities, they still have the merit to achieve good enough results.\n\nStarting at -50m in a 100m race is inherently more unfair than starting at 0m. \n\nAnd no, this isn't to say you haven't had a hard life, this is saying you haven't had a hard life because you are black.",

So no, it's not some dumbass shit, because socioeconomic status is very much intertwined with race - for example, historic racism regarding banks not affording black people mortgages in a racist practice called \"redlining\". The thing I do agree with you here is the fact it's a class war.\n\nAnd by the way - despite white people nowadays not being \"colonists\", it is still truthful to say a lot of white people in the US are descendants of colonists, where there still are ramifications in the US today, where wealth has historically been hoarded by white people through racist practices of discrimination.\n\nThis is not to argue against the fact that both black and white people are at higher risk of lack of opportunity due to poverty - it's to give a broader understanding of the antecedents to why this poverty has been allowed to occur.\n\nNow, if you ask why there aren't any policies that help impoverished white people, or the impoverished as a whole, then that's where most governments are failing. It's easier to convince persuade people to maintain capitalism rather than topple capitalism itself.",

If you go to the busier tourist parts of tokyo it\u2019s incredibly globalized already.  No one would blink an eye at a black person.  In the country shits a little different, but you gotta realize 90% of japan lives in major cities so the country is basically backwater farmland and an incredibly small chunk of their population .\n\nI personally studied abroad in japan in high school and one of my classmates from my american class is black.  She had a great experience and we were in the countryside.  Their english teacher was black so they asked if they knew each other and that was about it.  No snapping photos or touching without permission.  They were more amazed at my white classmates blue eyes tbh.  Her experience was so good she went on to attend japanese college in tokyo for two years as an exchange student.  Yes she experienced racism on occasions, none of it overt and it was easily overcome with conversation.  I\u2019m filipino and tbh filipinos have some negative stereotypes in japan and i had zero negative experiences during my study abroad or in the trips ive taken there after.  I\u2019m dark af too its not like i\u2019m being mistaken for a japanese person.\n\nNot excusing the ignorance that exists in asia.  It definitely exists and they don\u2019t really deserve much grace when it does, but the vast majority of racism anyone experiences there will be non confrontational and cultural norms there mean you probably won\u2019t even be interacted with at all.  Japan isn\u2019t a monolith and if a black person wants to visit they\u2019ll likely have a great experience.",
