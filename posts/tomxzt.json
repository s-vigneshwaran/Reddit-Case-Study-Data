While the dissenters are still clearly showing their bias in dissenting from the majority on what should be a clearly defined issue, this case was actually about the limits on the orders the Executive can issue to the military (and there are limits, though in this case they were not exceeded). Some soldiers didn\u2019t want to get vaxxed, despite a requirement for all military personnel to do so. They argued the requirement was an overreach of the President\u2019s authority. The rest of the court called bullshit. The 3 dissenters made some convoluted arguments about the \u201cleast restrictive measure\u201d requirement for certain Executive and Legislative rulemaking, which, while a terrible argument and clearly politically motivated rather than constitutionally supported, is nowhere near the same as saying the President isn\u2019t Commander-in-chief.\n\nThe way this is being posed sounds as if Thomas, Gorsuch, and Alito are just morons who don\u2019t understand the law. Unfortunately, they do, and they understand it well enough to be alot more crafty and divisive than \u201che isn\u2019t really the Commander-in-chief\u201d.\n\nTL:DR Don\u2019t rely on Vox headlines for your legal analysis. While you might have the right conclusion (that Thomas, Alito and Gorsuch are despicable partisan hacks) the actual details of the situation are alot more nuanced.",

It's really kind of insane that people can't just talk about anything anymore because everything is tied to some sort of political stance. Even freaking sports. So many people on the right have quit watching sports because political reason. Idc about the politics \"Aaron judge hit a grandslam today it was nice\" idc if he supports blm.

During the investigation (edit: changed for clarity) we also saw some very concerning precedents that Trump undertook to impede the investigations on several persons the Special Investigation was looking into, like Flynn and Cohen.\n\nThe investigation didn't start solely to prove that Trump personally colluded with the Russians. Rather, the investigation began to investigate foreign interference. Which it did find. And while the report neither condemns nor exonerates Trump, after investigation it demonstrated that foreign meddling was clearly welcomed and his 2016 campaign team hoped to benefit from said meddling.",

But the larger or more different units you have, ordering service by rank will become more of a clusterfuck and you really just do it more informally.\n\nThe president, commander of all troops, would never be able to eat on a military base or post, ever, if they had to abide by that strictly.

Instead of giving the money to the people, Mnuchin and Trump funneled about a trillion dollars to the richest in America and they should be brought to trial for that (but the right supports the murder of the American people for profit so it will probably never happen).\n\nAmerican healthcare is fucked beyond belief. They legitimately farm the masses for profit and I have no allegiance to the 'left' in the US, seeing as they are so far right they would be considered ultra-conservative in most any other country. The problem is that we don't have a free market in the US. It is a lie. We have corporate communism which funds the hyper-rich at the cost of the poor. We need universal healthcare and we need universal basic income. Labor being a condition of existence is just another form of slavery. Humans create the most unique good when they are free the anxiety of survival. \n\nI'll vote democrat only because they are less likely to kill me by decree and they at least pretend to have the best interests of the people and democracy at heart. The right straight up wants to dismantle democracy and institute a fascist theocracy, so the only possible option for anyone who gives two shits about the people or this country is to oppose the right whether or not the democrats are objectively 'good'",

That is the nature of science - you update your understanding of a situation as it changes. It has been known for a very long time that vaccines are not 100%. Some are really really good, some are pretty good. Your dismissal of science because it is not always right is interesting since you are actually utilizing the results of science in order to decry it. You are incorrectly framing the question to start with - the goal of trying to deal with the pandemic is to reduce the harm it causes. The hope was the vaccine would eliminate covid, the reality was that the vaccine mitigated covid. If you can't have perfect, take the best option.\n\nThe modern incarnation of the scientific method, particularly in the scope of the pressures of capitalism, has some severe shortcomings. In particular, negative results being undesirable results in individuals spinning research in ways that creates a healthy skepticism of proclamations. Unfortunately, when some people are shown the results of spin, their confidence in the concept of science is shaken and it is easier to pull them away from reality towards unfalsifiable claims and a constant feeling of conspiracy. There is no conspiracy of science. It's just a bunch of people trying to learn about the world and peacocking egos and sometimes they are wrong and a subset of those can't admit it. \n\nUnfortunately, what I expect you will take away from that is only that science can be wrong. If you are the kind of person who can approach math (and no shade if you're not) I would recommend reading up on Bayesian statistics. The goal is confidence in a hypothesis based on data that was observed, rather than validating on unknown quantities. Here is a reasonable intro:\n\n https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6406060/",

Are you simply contrarian to the entire conception of the government or do you vote to the right or left? If you vote to the right, why? If the reason is the economy, why do you still vote to the right despite the fact that every republican for 30+ years has increased the deficit and increased regression in taxes and every democrat has brought spending back towards responsible levels and decreased or eliminated the deficit.\n\nIf you vote on abortion, why would you vote against democrats when it is a documented fact that the number of abortions WORLDWIDE decreases significantly when democrats are in power because they fund programs that provide preventative measures to unwanted pregnancy.\n\nIf you vote conservative on the grounds of protecting democracy, why would you do so when fundamental attacks on free speech and voting rights have been consistently coming from the right?\n\nThe democrats are no angels, but they are far from the greatest threat to this nation and given the fact of US politics, they are the only logical choice for the present, unless you want to actually replace the government with a non-democratic christian fundamentalist regime.",

There is a lot of research that demonstrates this on a mathematical level.\n2. Constitutionally and historically, there is no precedent for a size of the Supreme Court. The constitution merely says there should be one. The fact that the population has grown significantly since the inception of the Supreme Court suggests that the Court should grow to meet the needs of the population. Republicans acted in bad faith on Obama's potential appointment and then hypocritically reversed their stance on when it is appropriate to appoint to the Supreme Court because it was to their advantage. In fact, the SC has actually changed in size 7-8 times. Most political scholars tend to agree that since the Conservatives have violated the precedent of allowing the sitting President to nominate a SC pick, thereby packing the court in their favor, the only logical move by the Democrats is to level the playing field again.\n3. Abortion is constitutionally protected, as per Roe v. Wade. The claim that human organs are being harvested for profit has been debunked repeatedly. No one is using those donations to pay for abortions - that was a lie made up to stir up controversy and outrage.",

It is simply our duty to do so. The constitution does not actually provide a protection for insurrection and there are, in fact, multiple laws against sedition. Just because a bunch of people didn't like the outcome of the election doesn't mean they are being reduced to \"under absolute despotism\".\n\nAt the end of the day, here is my take on that: It is their responsibility to do so if they genuinely feel that the government has eliminated their freedom, but it is not their right under the rule of law to try and usurp the nation. They tried to dismantle democracy, they failed. They were tools being wielded by members of the right-wing and those people should be held accountable as well. But if they are not punished, then the precedent is set for anyone to attempt a coup as they see fit. As it is, they are not being punished anywhere near as harshly as they would have been if they were liberals trying to overthrow the government.\n\nOtherwise, we would have had to consider that the South weren't traitors to the nation after the Civil War. They were all pardoned, but technically, every single one of them were traitors because they raised arms against the rightful government of the United States of America.\n\nIn the last few years I'm sure every single one of us has sat down and had a serious thought about where the line is for us - at what point do we feel like we have to sacrifice our life to defend freedom, liberty, and justice. The point is, that when that moment arises, there is no recourse other than to lay down your life and hope that you are on the right side of history. They were not. And sadly, they were a human sacrifice made by the powers that be. There was an actual plot run by actual members of a major political party in our nation to try and overthrow a legitimate election and instate an illegitimate President and they sacrificed their own people in that attempt.\n\nas for your second point, that is the nature of discourse. In an ideal world, we would be using the knowledge we had and our skills of reasoning to spar with each other until we uncovered the truth of the matter. But we need to take some things as axiomatic. For me, those things include that all humans, regardless of race, gender, sexuality, or religion, should be given a world where they can reliably achieve the same outcome. This is unique from being given the same opportunity and some people may have to work harder than others. But this axiom means that certain potentially ambiguous points are interpreted in a certain way. That way may and has changed during the course of my life.\n\nI appreciate that our conversation has been civil (after a few barbs at the beginning). I don't think people on the right are inherently evil people, but I genuinely believe that the establishment of the right is attempting to overthrow the entire concept of discourse and cooperation and that they have been severely infiltrated by foreign interests and the people who are suffering the most are their followers.",

That people on both sides of the aisle do shitty things? Yeah I know that already chief. \n\nI also know that for the first time in my countries history a president committed actionable treason. On national television no less. I watched \"patriots\" beat a man to death with a fire extinguisher, and smear shit on the walls of the capitol while I was eating dinner. \n\nI'm good on thinking beyond Trump, I can do that when he dies in jail. And you? You can kiss my ass for telling me to move past it. No one that cares about this country and has a lick of sense will rest easy until the nest of russian affiliated traitors is hosed out of our political system like horse shit on a stall floor. \n\nJust because you think you have somehow found \"the really real truth\" doesn't mean you are some arbiter of what I can care about. Grow up, stop listening that fat fuck alex \"no show\" (at his court hearings) jones. \n\nBetter yet realize that the people whose narrative you are buying into would literally eat you alive if it made them money, and they are using their bullshit conspiracy theory as an idiot filter, just like a nigerian prince scam sent with a combination of poor grammar and spelling. It's to make sure only an idiot will keep reading/listening, they are who these grifters want, because only idiots buy dick pills, or send all their money via western union to a stranger who is apparently royalty. \n\nAll yelling \"wake up\" does is tell me you are a fucking mark.",

Juniors eating before the troops was a cultural norm for my old unit and every unit I was in. The only time someone senior got to cut the line was for working meals, and they didn\u2019t get to do that very often, and VIP civilians got to the front of the line always and junior troops were sat with the VIPs so the VIPS could chat with the junior troops.

And they refuse to acknowledge that they are getting exactly how they treated everyone else. Aka, conservatives are ducking useless hypocrites and can all kiss my ass. \n\nHell, bring any Republican from Reagan or earlier, and todays GQPNazi scum would call them RINOs and unamerican traitors. Send any of the GQPNazi scum back to the early 1990\u2019s/late 1980\u2019s and tell the republicans of that day this is a Republican in thirty years, that they are supporting Russia and Putin (and yes they knew who HE was then) and that they are wearing shirts better Russian than democratic, and the old school Republican would throw up in disgust.

In the field, the trainees were always first in line, followed by the most junior cadet cadre, and the most senior cadet cadre were in the back. On active duty, day to day, everyone breaks for lunch and goes their separate ways. In the field, when surviving on MREs, everyone generally eats at either a) the same time or b) when you have the opportunity, situation dependent. When in training where a dining facility (DFAC) serves meals, more senior personnel will often attempt to let their subordinates get fed first depending on the size of the element eating together (squad, platoon, company, etc). \n\nThere are practical reasons for this, and it isn't just a weird tradition. Generally, the lowest ranking are often doing the most physical work and leaders want to ensure their subordinates are fed, and eating. Another reason is that if food begins to run low, or even run out, those at the end of the line are the most impacted. If those at the end of the line have higher rank, they have more resources to have the situation addressed while also being made aware of the issue first so it can be handled as quickly as possible.\n\nIn the case of the photo above, it appears that the soldiers are eating at a dining facility on post during a regular duty day. In these situations, since everyone is coming and going on an individual basis, the need for senior personnel to eat last doesn't really apply since units are released at different times to eat and there isn't any sort of coordination between them. Even if Biden got served before others, which he almost certainly did given that other units had likely yet to be released for lunch, it isn't a respect issue in the least. But, to address the photo directly, the soldiers in the background are finishing their lunch and are likely getting ready to head back to work. \n\nTldr; while there's some truth to senior military personnel waiting for their subordinates to eat before they do, given the context in this case, the tweet here is utter bullshit.\n\nSource: 12 years of active duty, West Point graduate.

              "text": "It's kind of funny/sad how so many of the US Navy's traditions were directly pulled out of the Royal Navy's practice of impressing American sailors. For those unfamiliar with 'impressing' in the Naval context, it means to capture at sea and then force into slavery onboard their own ships.\n\nBasically, quite a few US Navy 'hallowed traditions' go back to the measures that were in place to keep enslaved Americans in check.\n\n---\n*Fair warning; I went on a bit of a ranting ramble at this point about the comically dysfunctional \"leadership\" structure in the Navy. So, feel free to skip.*\n\n*For context, I did time in both the Navy and Army and am now deep in the civilian corporate world.*\n\n---\n\nOn a related and unsurprising note, the Navy is also the one branch that has somehow confused 'leadership' with 'barely functional management'. Every other branch has at least some sort of basic program if not an actual school to help plant a basic sense of leadership into people stepping into those roles. The Navy has quite literally *nothing*. It's insane. Their NCOs simply sit through a few PowerPoint presentations and then (*insert magic wand wave here*) and *poof* they're now a 'leader' that is qualified to lead their fellow crewmembers in life or death situations. Corporate America hidden away safely behind their desk jobs has a better grasp of leadership.\n\nAnd honestly, it's not even worth getting into the Officer's corps. Despite what Hollywood likes to pretend, Naval officers are all but entirely removed from anything related to leadership. As DEEP_SEA_MAX pointed out, the complete segregation of officers and enlisted makes them nearly irrelevant here.\n\nBut, even they make the Chief's Mess look good. Honestly, if there is one easy change that the Navy could do to dramatically improve multiple areas of itself, it would be to abolish the Chief's Mess. In the Navy, there is a very direct relation to how good a Chief is at their job to how much time they spend in the Mess.\n\nAll that being said, there are a few legitimately good leaders that make their way through the Navy on occasion. But, they were simply that select few that had the innate ability to be good leaders. The Navy, unlike the other branches (yes, even the AF) does not breed any of their own.",

It was entirely a weather-related decision, and I thought the proper thing to do.\u201d\n\nFORMER DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF ZACH FUENTES: \u201cI did not hear POTUS call anyone losers when I told him about the weather.\u201d\n\nThere are over 10 more quotes of witness saying it did not happen.  Btw the first guy wrote a book bashing trump so I highly doubt he would lie for trump, along with 10+ others.\n\nI can\u2019t find the article right now where they said the statement was recanted.  I will find it though.  It went into detail about how it was all right around election time and it turned out the \u201c4 people\u201d that stated it happened, was really 1 person that told three other people trump said blah blah.  Everything fell apart.  Plus 14 people saying it didn\u2019t happen should be proof enough.  Especially when a guy who writes books bashing trump says the \u201canonymous source\u201d is lying",

The Navy, Marines, and Air Force usually went to that one, with some army, the other DFAC on post was mostly Army except sometimes other branches would show up there depending on what they had going. The AF DFAC was the only one that was open on Sundays, but most people were off post the weekends anyways so it wasn\u2019t really that busy Sunday. \n\nI know the pushing juniors forward was a thing for my old unit, and was common for the 1ID whenever I was around them. I saw it at Hood for the one DFAC when I got stuck there for an extra month.\n\nFunniest thing I saw at the mixed post, an AF NCO telling two junior airmen to stop fucking around with WOW and look at the female troops that were with them IN the PX, because the two female troops were trying to flirt with the two boys and the boys were totally oblivious to it as they were so involved with their planning a raid that night.",

The hypocrisy pissed me off. Democratic president, threats in uniform are okay and excused; Republican president, saying a policy is a bad idea is tantamount to treason. Nope, duck that, hold the standards the same or duck off. \n\nI was in Kosovo back in 99 when Clinton came to visit the province.

I personally wanted nothing to do with it because of the fiasco, even though I was a fan to a point.

We all stand in the chow line, however anyone who has an oncoming watch has front of line privilege's.\n\nPlus I served on submarines, which has it's own set of traditions and customs.  Personal space on a sub is very limited, and we go to very great lengths to respect that space.  So when you have 125 people crammed in a space that's 46ft across and about 450ft long, you do some pretty strange things.\n\nThere were also times that we would suspend our customs, like Saturday night underway was pizza night, and the crew's mess was open to everyone and it was normal to see the officers hang out and eat pizza, and watch a movie with the crew.",

I'm just as pissed as you, but after a cause like the pandemic, that actually is proof RepubliCons used for stock market gains in PHUCKING BODY BAGS!! I'M AN AMERICAN, not a monster changing laws made to satisfy red tape. 800,000+ Americans are Dead! EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND PLUS AMERICANS ARE DEAD!!! Trump knew since November 2020 about the pandemic. The CDC had positions listed on many job sites in November 2020, for directors, secretaries, Scientist's and Drs. Your beloved Pres murdered his partner in crime, Jeffrey Epstein. The convenience of and motive too? Have you seen pics of Biden with Epstein?\n I've seen more compromising photos of Trump...with all the evidence,  is it horse blinders or just the fact you liked his stupid show? \nI'm all for gun rights, it's just those that own them, aren't. When did we forget inalienable rights? \nWhen did we lose faith in American?\nWhy does Congress get all the benefits (free rides, free cloths, right offs, self raises, as if they've done any good for any American). It's not the President, it's the criminals in Congress. Regulation, the reason why making sense of the Constitution is impossible is because regulations are written with no regard to consequences. When the consequence is by illegal actions, it's already been recognized as a debatable issue. That's why Congress needs a clean sweep, just like all regulations need to be suspended. You can't even make sense with moral and ethic. When I posed the premise of moral and ethic, Hillary Clinton scoffed at me, saying moral and ethic wasn't written in the Constitution. No, but it WAS written in the sense, that you don't murder ppl, period. It should not be a debate when the evidence is clear. But then you have criminals writing bullshit in regulations that makes obvious murder debatable. Lastly, what's a persons word worth if the Oath they took is worthless? They should all go to Gitmo for the rest of their unforgiven lives.",
