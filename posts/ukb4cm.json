How amazing.  I still don't know if it was duty to the country, a sense of self-preservation, Dan Quayle's guidance, or all of that.",

As far as I know, there's three books and they're all very good. If you listen to them, the reader does a great job with all the voices and shit.\n\nAnyway, I kinda thought that was a bit unbelievable (the election of a hyper-religious dude as president).

                      "text": "Thanks for deepening the knowledge here!\n\nAnd I'm loving the modern recognition of \"the quickening\"  and seeing people realizing the arbitrariness of what we call \"humanity,\" and how we assign this status based upon so many myriad variables. It's encouraging to see people recognizing the subconscious tendency almost all of us have to qualify others' humanity into quasi-caste systems in our minds, usually without even realizing we are doing so. \n\nI want to see more of this, more people realizing that there are \"levels of humanness\" in our cultural lexicon at this point in history, in this geographic location specifically, at least. More people are starting to realize that there is a \"standard of humanity\" that tends to reflect the Platonic ideal of a \"perfect\" member of the ruling class. No one can achieve this ideal, even the reviled \"1%.\" It is impossible because it does not exist in reality, like trying to make Barbie's body proportions work with living anatomy (spoiler, her spine would snap). \n\nWe, all of us, need to collectively realize that this segregationist mindset is mutually destructive in the long run. None of us wins in this scenario. No one will ever be enough. Today, people who can get pregnant are being targeted. But what arbitrarily labeled group would be the next target, if this was achieved? The disabled? The mentally ill? Groups with minority opinions of *any sort* that might deviate from the allowed standard?\n\nThis is not just a dangerous moment for people who can get pregnant and those who love and support them. This is a pivotal moment in modern human history, even regardless of the specific subject being debated! The concept of the dehumanization of half of the population where these laws apply, to such a degree that permanent harm and/or death can and *will* occur in devastatingly large numbers, should terrify us all. \n\nThis is us, today, at this moment. This is not a \"slippery slope.\" It is a suicidal leap. It is the mute submission to tyranny that will ruin us, and the only way we can save ourselves is to defy this ruling, to oppose the repugnant dissolution of the freedom of independent life that has been hard-fought for and won through terrible suffering, after so many generations. \n\nEdit: fleshing out the last lines",

I guess it depends on the age old debate on \"when human life begins\". When does human life begin?\n\nAt conception? At heart formation? At brain formation? When we navigated out of our mom's baby maker? Maybe life begin's after we can start retaining long term memories, which may not be until 2 years old?\n\nEither way, we have a severe clash of differing truths when it comes to abortion and what it is and what it means.\n\nI hope our lawmakers find a wise and respectable way to legislate all of this.",

It\u2019s just that no state would be like \u201cnah we\u2019ll pass\u201d when asked to bring in a criminal with a violent crime. For instance a friend of mine found out they had a warrant out for their arrest (missing a court date they were unaware of) in a state 2 thousand miles away. It was for felony possession of marijuana, the cops from the state he currently lived in just informed him that there was indeed a warrant but they do not do extraditions for such kind of case. \n\nHe got pulled over when he was about 300 miles from that state and they did in fact arrest him and extradited him back to the state he caught the charge in. \n\nSo in a case where someone \u201ccommits murder\u201d i.e. has an abortion in say Ohio, but they live in Oklahoma, it is up to Ohio to prosecute. That is how it should be. Oklahoma\u2019s backwood gremlins shouldn\u2019t get their grubby little paws on her for doing something that isn\u2019t illegal in the state her body was in. That would be like arresting someone who posted a photo on Facebook of them smoking weed in Denver and was seen by their hometown sheriff\u2019s office in Jacksonville- it\u2019s illegal to smoke weed in Florida, *let\u2019s go get him boys!* There would be absolute anarchy. \n\n*But* it really sounds like they are going full speed ahead with this crap and may start changing the laws to bend to their will- so in the future, if we can\u2019t stop them, this might happen.",

Not to win the cases but to bury them in nonsensical legal paperwork which - based on how they wrote SB8, even if they win their case they can't sue for the attorney fees.  \n\nAnyone can file the suits, even if you don't live in texas.  Just file a suit saying you saw someone that looked like senator Cancun Cruz drive a pregnant woman to a clinic and then she wasnt pregnant anymore.  He'll still have to show up in court, pay a lawyer, be inconvenienced etc. He'll win obviously, but can't countersue for legal fees.  Then more people keep doing it to him.  And Abbott & Paxton.  In order for them to get it to stop, they'd have to change the law bc as its written now, there's nothing they can do to prevent people from doing it. \n\nYou'd need a retired lawyer or other shady tyoe lawyer bc technically they'd be filings a case they knew to be false - which could cost them their license or get them disbarred, but there's probably some non-practicing lawyers willing to risk it out of principle in an effort to get it repealed (or just to watch the sheer stupidity of it play out in the courts).  Imagine hundreds of people filing random lawsuits with unrelated \"incidents\" against the same few texas politicians. At the very least, even if they're immediately dismissed for lack of evidence they'd need to respond with filings, pay court fees & show up in court.",

In those days, social convention treated women poorly. They couldn\u2019t own property. They couldn\u2019t get a job to support themselves. If a woman had no father, husband, or son, she had no legal protection. Her options were slavery or prostitution. If an unmarried woman wasn\u2019t a virgin, it was extremely difficult for her to get married. If she wasn\u2019t marriageable, her father didn\u2019t have much use for her.\n\n>God\u2019s punishment on the rapist of a virgin\u2014a monetary fine and lifelong responsibility\n\nSorry dude. Plenty of christians out there DEFENDING this scripture of the rapist marrying who he raped.\n\nThis is what you guys do. Every time something bad comes up about religion you say \"well MY specific sect of this religion doesn't believe that (even if it does, and you are lying) just to make your religion look better.",

Women were chattel. By raping a woman you wrecked the possibility of her family getting a bride price for her and you wrecked her ability to get a husband. Therefore she was yours. You had to make restitution to the family and take care of her for the rest of her life.\n\nIt would be cruel in modern culture, but it was a protection in those times.\n\n\nNot just one christian defending it, again sorry. You don't get to \"we don't believe this\" your way out of it. It's in the bible. Christians believe it. Maybe not YOUR christians, but many do all the same. You can't disown them from being christian anymore than they can disown you.",

Otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered, since the worshipers, having once been cleansed, would no longer have any consciousness of sins? But in these sacrifices there is a reminder of sins every year. For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.\n\nThe old law was a physical representation of spiritual reality, and thus, because \u201cthe wages of sin is death\u201d (Rom. 6:23), so was the physical punishment for trespass.\n\nHebrews 10:5-10\n\nConsequently, when Christ came into the world, he said,\n\u201cSacrifices and offerings you have not desired,\nbut a body have you prepared for me;\nin burnt offerings and sin offerings\nyou have taken no pleasure.\nThen I said, \u2018Behold, I have come to do your will, O God,\nas it is written of me in the scroll of the book.\u2019\u201d\nWhen he said above, \u201cYou have neither desired nor taken pleasure in sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings\u201d (these are offered according to the law), then he added, \u201cBehold, I have come to do your will.\u201d He does away with the first in order to establish the second. And by that will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.\n\nWhen Christ came, he did away with the physicality of the law and freed those who follow him from the spiritual penalties as well.  Otherwise, death by stoning would still be the punishment for many of these trespasses.  \n\nThe killing for sin in the OT was not a contradiction to \u201cthou shall not kill\u201d, but God\u2019s authority that he exercised to show the people the real cost of their sin.",

Guess God forgot to add that major caveat to the commandments... \n  \nWell let's leave the \"justified killing\" thing aside.  \n\nPlease explain how the bibble tells you to treat immigrants and the way they actually get treated by the religious right.  \n \n  \nLove Refugees As Yourself\nWhen a foreigner resides among you in your land, do not mistreat them. The foreigner residing among you must be treated as your native-born. Love them as yourself, for you were foreigners in Egypt. (Leviticus 19:33-34)\n\nLeave Food for the Poor and the Foreigner\nWhen you reap the harvest of your land, do not reap to the very edges of your field or gather the gleanings of your harvest. Do not go over your vineyard a second time or pick up the grapes that have fallen. Leave them for the poor and the foreigner. (Leviticus 19:9-10)\n\nGod Loves the Foreigner Residing Among You\nHe defends the cause of the fatherless and the widow, and loves the foreigner residing among you, giving them food and clothing. And you are to love those who are foreigners, for you yourselves were foreigners in Egypt. (Deuteronomy 10:18-19)\n\nDo Not Oppress a Foreigner\nDo not oppress a foreigner; you yourselves know how it feels to be foreigners, because you were foreigners in Egypt. (Exodus 23:9)\n\nDo Not Deprive Foreigners Among You of Justice\n\u201cSo I will come to put you on trial. I will be quick to testify against sorcerers, adulterers and perjurers, against those who defraud laborers of their wages, who oppress the widows and the fatherless, and deprive the foreigners among you of justice, but do not fear me,\u201d says the Lord Almighty. (Malachi 3:5)\n\nDo Whatever the Foreigner Asks of You\n\u201cAs for the foreigner who does not belong to your people Israel but has come from a distant land because of your name- for they will hear of your great name and your mighty hand and your outstretched arm-when they come and pray toward this temple, then hear from heaven, your dwelling place. Do whatever the foreigner asks of you, so that all the peoples of the earth may know your name and fear you, as do your own people Israel, and may know that this house I have built bears your Name. (1 Kings 8:41-44)\n\nLeave Your Door Open to the Traveler\nNo stranger had to spend the night in the street, for my door was always open to the traveler (Job, discussing his devotion to God) (Job 31:32)\n\nInvite the Stranger In\nFor I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.\u2019 (Matthew 25:25-36)\n\nWe Were All Baptized By One Spirit\nJust as a body, though one, has many parts, but all its many parts form one body, so it is with Christ. For we were all baptized by one Spirit so as to form one body-whether Jews or Gentiles, slave or free-and we were all given the one Spirit to drink. Even so the body is not made up of one part but of many. (1 Corinthians 12:12-14)\n\nLove Your Neighbor as Yourself\nFor the entire law is fulfilled in keeping this one command: \u201cLove your neighbor as yourself.\u201d (Galatians 5:14)\n\nHave Mercy on Your Neighbor\nHe asked Jesus, \u201cAnd who is my neighbor?\u201d\n\nIn reply Jesus said: \u201cA man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, when he was attacked by robbers. They stripped him of his clothes, beat him and went away, leaving him half dead. A priest happened to be going down the same road, and when he saw the man, he passed by on the other side. So too, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him. He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own donkey, brought him to an inn and took care of him. The next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper. \u2018Look after him,\u2019 he said, \u2018and when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have.\u2019\n\n\u201cWhich of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?\u201d\n\nThe expert in the law replied, \u201cThe one who had mercy on him.\u201d\n\nJesus told him, \u201cGo and do likewise.\u201d (Luke 10:29-37)",

I actually explained as much in a comment I made a few days ago on another post:\n\n> \u201cThe ones I\u2019m most embarrassed by - as a conservative Christian - are Christian republicans.  I use Christian as an adjective in their case intentionally because they so often allow their political ideals to determine - and often times corrupt - what the Bible says.  If Jesus were on earth now, they would blast him for being so non-Christian.\u201d\n\nThe \u201creligious right\u201d are so concerned with their political dogma that their understanding of scripture and adherence to what it says has been corrupted.  But that is not a fault on the Bible, that is a fault on the idiots who say they act based on the Bible.\n\nNow, shall we get back to the argument at hand, or would you like to address more irrelevant points?",

Interesting how different states go about it. \n\nI agree it\u2019s easy to say and nigh impossible to implement. I, personally, have no idea where the line is. I agree that killing a fully viable baby is absolutely NOT ok, and I also agree that the mother\u2019s health is of the utmost importance. I have no idea where to draw the line in general, let alone in the extremes. \n\nPersonally, I got pregnant incredibly young and even though I was not ready, I carried my baby and have raised them to my fullest ability. But the option to not I think has to exist. Not everyone is able to gestate and raise a baby. \n\nAlso, with the point that people will take advantage: I don\u2019t think theft and abortion can be equated. Theft can possibly give an advantage in life and works with peoples\u2019 wants. I don\u2019t think anyone would exactly *want* an abortion. Sorry the wording is hard for me here. At a certain point, I think too many abortion start to affect the mothers health (I think because of messing with hormones that much), so it\u2019s not really a thing women can \u201ctake advantage of\u201d for personal gain. I\u2019m sure there will be outliers proving me wrong, but on this same point - if we restrict abortion this extremely because someone can take advantage, shouldn\u2019t we do the same with tax evasion? So many people don\u2019t pay as much as they \u201cshould\u201d because of perfectly legal loopholes. \n\nThere are so many problematic laws that cover the extremes that I find it hard to argue for one and not them all.

Also, if you ever call the suicide hotline, the first thing they ask you for is your address so they can report it and send cops over. I'm a lot better now but those experiences traumatized me.

How many children are going to suffer through neglect or simply being dumped, on mass due to women being forced, to mother a child born of rape?? or that millions of women are just going to elect to be sterilised, just incase their contraception fails??\nI can't believe it is 2022 and this bullshit!  is actually happening??  it's beyond nuts to me as a brit, as a women and as a mother of a daughter.

How is this American?  It\u2019s insane. We came for religious freedom only to be held in bondage by Christian beliefs. The idea that we separate religion from civil law has been lost.

It is BAD.  \n\nThere ARE states which codified access to abortion into the state constitution - Washington state is one of them - and there is already a network of charities/volunteers to help to fund travel, lodging, cost of services, food, etc for those who need it.  \n\nDonate here to support that network across the United States:  https://abortionfunds.org/\n\nFor people located in the United States, look here to find the local chapter of this network to support/donate/volunteer:   https://abortionfunds.org/funds/\n\n\nYeah it is nuts here.  Roughly 19% of Americans believe abortion should be illegal always (which - fine, they are welcome to NOT HAVE ONE then, if they in fact possess a uterus) and yet:  our SCOTUS is about to strike down not just abortion rights. . . but privacy and so very much more.  \n\nIt is time to burn it all down.   In the meantime:  please continue to support your local/national abortion fund!   \ud83d\ude20",

Wrap up, watch your cycle, or take it up the ass. Or just don't have penetrative sex if you genuinely can't afford to have a child under any circumstances.",

Once again, you are a man with no clue whatsoever what this opens up for women. It's easy for you to brush us off cause it'll never happen to you.\n\n>I personally think that those instances are the strongest casw the pro abortion side has.\n\nYet you do not care at all that this is going to happen.\n\nAs you said, \"close your legs\". Okay, so let's say all women everywhere just stop having sex unless they're trying for a baby. You think men aren't going to pump up those rape numbers? So then what? Oh well those are *outliers* that don't matter. So take it up the ass then? No thanks, and you're a complete douchebag for saying that.\n\nYour logic is full of wishes and dreams and not of actual substance. I don't need someone that stupid calling the shots on my bodily autonomy. ZERO women should ever, in 2022 in an allegedly civilized country, be forced to give birth against their will, especially not to their rapist. But we are heading back to those dark ages and the dumbest of our society are welcoming it with open arms.",

And charges akin to mass genocide to men who masturbate (they are killing innumerable potential children by blowing their load into a napkin as opposed to a woman's vagina). This all makes sense to me because I have the mental maturity of a 12 year old boy and I think that just because human cells have the potential to eventually become sentient, conscious life, that means they should be treated like sentient, conscious life always. I intend to push this forward to my congressman and I suggest you do too!",

Then I discovered my baby had trisomy 18, possibly wouldn\u2019t make it to birth, or would die shortly there after due to also having severe heart defects.  I couldn\u2019t exhaust all testing until I was nearly 16 weeks.  The testing left me leaking amniotic fluid.  And I didn\u2019t get my results till nearly 18 weeks.  But my doctors couldn\u2019t do anything until I was very sick.  Oh and I have a history of c sections.  So in my state of Texas, my options were get sick enough to terminate here, or carry my baby to term and have major surgery to either deliver a stillborn baby or a baby who I would watch die as soon as they cut the cord.",

For most of the 20th century the view was that taking a life is only justified when totally necessary - namely capital punishment for murderers and in justified wars.\n\nIn 2018 the Catechism was revised to formally state that capital punishment is in violation of church doctrine - citing in part that alternate forms of punishment / deferment are increasingly pragmatic. Relevant excerpt and link:\n\n> Today, however, there is an increasing awareness that the dignity of the person is not lost even after the commission of very serious crimes. In addition, a new understanding has emerged of the significance of penal sanctions imposed by the state. Lastly, more effective systems of detention have been developed, which ensure the due protection of citizens but, at the same time, do not definitively deprive the guilty of the possibility of redemption.\n\n>Consequently, the Church teaches, in the light of the Gospel, that \u201cthe death penalty is inadmissible because it is an attack on the inviolability and dignity of the person\u201d,[1] and she works with determination for its abolition worldwide.\n\n[https://press.vatican.va/content/salastampa/en/bollettino/pubblico/2018/08/02/180802a.html](https://press.vatican.va/content/salastampa/en/bollettino/pubblico/2018/08/02/180802a.html)\n\nI have a mixed relationship with the Catholic Church (can probably take a shot in the dark on some issues based on the thread we\u2019re in) but I do think at least on capital punishment it has moved in the right direction more recently.",

There is far too much history, and life is way too metal, for their to be any \"just god\". At the very least, people who are religious should feel disdain for there god simply because he created us out of meat, made resources scarce, and made death a thing.\n\nThey should be asking themselves, \"Why the fuck would god put me on earth to test me, when he could have created me perfect to begin with?\" Doesn't seem all powerful to me.\n\nIf there is a god, he doesn't give one single fuck about anything of this. He turned this simulation on and walked away.",

What about children who die of starvation? Why did he even give them life? Also, once a baby goes to heaven(if they're even allowed in since they didn't prove themselves), would they be a baby that grows up in heaven or would they be an adult with a blank personality? If they are a baby that grows up in heaven, why isn't that the default?\n\nThis is just shit I'm coming up with off the top of my head. These are all lines of thinking that should lead you directly out of religion. Hence my point, they're not thinking for themselves. They're not introspecting. Their growth as a person is stalled.",

Educating all children is not there\u2026 (which Texas now wants to outlaw).

And Trump packed the Supreme Court with loyalists. Including a sexual predator. (Brett)\n\nMeanwhile, Southern states never stopped being racist or oppressive. However, the Civil Rights era moved the national government to pass laws ending oppression (the Voting Rights Act, the Civil Rights Act - both put in the constitution thank god, or the south would be attacking that too)\n\nIf it\u2019s not in the constitution, then it\u2019s not protected. \n\nBack to the court system - the courts rely on \u201cprecedence\u201d, which is honoring past rulings to keep the justice system fair and equal without major changes.

Because the precedence will impact a judge\u2019s ruling) \n\nWell, the Trump-loyal judges were put in directly to ignore precedence an tule in pro-conservative and pro-fundamental Christian ways. Anything can change now! It\u2019s horrific and it\u2019s throwing the US justice system onto the ground and just shattering decades of progress for civil rights.\n\nAny court jurisdiction that sues now to bring back oppressive laws is being approved by the Supreme Court (turning away gay patients at doctors officers, bounty programs to attack women and doctors, persecuting teachers\u2026.)\n\nThis is happening with civil courts rather than criminal, but the Supreme Court is allowing it. (Aka: enable non-government entities to sue and jail others who veer from Conservative preference with success) \n\nThanks to people voting for Trump and republicans, the county\u2019s legal system has been irrevocably damaged for the next decade or more. \n\nAnd the south is rising again. With legal protection.\n\nPeople need to vote for dems if they want it to stop, who can withdraw their state\u2019s lawsuits from using tax money to make their way up to the Supreme Court to legalize oppression again.\n\nPrivate citizens will still be able to sue and win\u2026 but voting in democrats can stop states from writing oppressive laws back into their state constitutions again.\n\nFortunately! Dems could also vote to put abortion and lgbt rights in the constitution. Yet, unfortunately, they won\u2019t\u2026\u2026\u2026.. because many just want to be paid and go home safe without actually protecting their people - only their own wallets. \n\nMeanwhile, conservatives are ardently passionate, angry, hateful, and more than publicly showing they are ready for violence and to attack those they don\u2019t like. (From black \u201cno surrendering accepted\u201d war flags flown from their homes and trucks, to supporting people who argue for civil war and to imprison non-conservatives) \n\nIt\u2019s scary\u2026 and it\u2019s going to keep getting worse.",

          "text": "Well the liberal position is, anti-death penalty and pro-abortion. Which can seem contradictory at face value. In the view that, liberals are against killing by the state for a convicted criminal but are ok with the states endorsement or protection of killing with an innocent or non-consensual being.\n\nConservatives would say both of theses are murder, premeditated killing. But I would say that abortion is not strictly murder, in the sense that it's more about preventing a life (that hasn't started), rather than where capital punishment is more of ending or preventing a life of a person from continuing. \n\nThe main problem with the definition of preventing a life, being equal to murder is that, you can argue that, anytime you prevent life you are committing murder. By not allowing life or space conducive for birth. So anytime you aren't making babies, 24/7 you are preventing perfectly valid lives of humans being born.\n\nNow that position seems egregiously wrong for obvious reasons. For example the Romanian regime that thought that having a lot of babies was a good idea but most of them turned out to be orphans in the 90s. That is demonstratively not great and in a utilitarian point of view would reduce the well-being of everyone involved. And I'm not even bringing up the pro-choice part and the woman's body and all those reasons why abortion advocated for (not just the point about ending life). \n\nBut I can see why people could get confused and or have the naive opinion that they are the same thing, when they really are not. It's important to have nuanced investigation and understandings about these things and not make broad generalizations and claims.",

The idea is to have the death penalty for performing abortions, not for having one. The idea is to keep physicians (or anyone else) from feeling like it is worthwhile to be the person doing the aborting.\n\nThis is in direct response to the point made by pro-choicers: \"Removing abortion won't eliminate abortions, it will only stop careful, doctor-managed abortions.\"\n\nThe response being, \"we'll make it the death penalty, so even criminals will be too scared to use the coat hanger\".\n\nAgain, I am not advocating this position,  just clarifying the logic.\n\nEDIT: Apparently, this particular bill also has a provision where the mother could ne charged with assault or murder, so, this is truly the darkest timeline.",

A man responsible for that conception and now life, shall have his paycheck garnished from that moment forward in order to provide for the fetus. It\u2019s a person right? People have needs only money can sate. \n\nNext, since the fetus is a person, and unable to provide for or care for themselves, the government should pay a universal income to any pregnant woman for the length of the pregnancy. As it can\u2019t care for itself, the only logical conclusion we come to is that the mother, vessel for you religious folks,  be protected at all costs. It is a medical fact the fetus needs the mother to survive and thrive for it to do the same. Any denial for the care of the mother is denial of care for the fetus and should be thusly punishable by law. All medical expenses for pregnancy should now be the burden of the state. The state wants to protect life? Well medical care is a key component in that fetuses life. And as it is unable to enact care for itself, the government clearly needs to do that themselves. Anyone denying this is an accessory to murder. \n\nAnyone who impedes the fetus from obtaining the care it needs is guilty of attempted murder.

Any time two people come together and have sex it is implied they both know a baby is possible regardless of likelihood Yep but that whole thing is a completely different topic. \n\nThe biggest problem I see is we don\u2019t have an unambiguous time that we can say the fetus is now living. The problem with going off viability is it can vary so wildly. For example the earliest baby to be delivered and survive is 21 weeks and 5 days where as the usual is 24 or more weeks. It will all depend on how fast the baby matured in the womb, the ability of local specialties, and luck so I don\u2019t think that is a reasonable thing to use for a metric especially at the rate technology is progressing which means in 5 years it might be possible to keep a fetus at even less development alive. Will we then amend to the newest time whenever one is found viable or will we say 24 weeks is usual so that\u2019s when we will stop. \n\nAs for your grain of sand in a pile example it doesn\u2019t work for me because we have other metrics we could use that are non ambiguous for the same thing. I could say I have 300 lbs or 3,000,000 grains of sand. With a fetus it would be heart beat, brain function, neuro response etc. We have metrics that we could use but still we can\u2019t agree",

If these were parents that could easily care for a child and were forced to abort, but no, most abortions happen because people aren't ready to be parents, they can't pay for food, or medicine, or the larger home, or lose the money from working more hours. It just makes me fucking angry that after literally two CENTURIES with a FUCKING CONSTITUTION as the basis for our entire government saying split religion from government, our government still forces the entire country to follow barbaric Christian values.\n\nSo I'll just ask, where do I buy a stick as wide as my two thumbs to beat my wife with?

No, it's about whether abortion is murder or not.\n\nThe left has turned the conversation into being about bodily autonomy, even though we already have laws restricting bodily autonomy when it comes to harming other people. If you consider a fetus a human, then it's murder, and therefore calling it murder has merit. I mean the fetus has a brain at 3 weeks gestation, and a heartbeat a couple of weeks after that.\n\nThat's why abortion isn't a simple topic, and if you're still under the impression that it's about bodily autonomy or controlling women, you haven't spent enough time thinking about why so many people are actually against it.\n\nIf you hit someone with your car because you were texting and they needed a kidney to survive, do you think you'd have a moral obligation to donate your kidney to them?

If abortion is illegal, doctors have to wait until the woman is actively dying before they can remove it from her. Also abortions usually aren't anyone's method of choice for contraception. People wear condoms, take the pill, etc, but they can all fail, and that's without even taking into consideration the side effects of some contraceptive methods. It's also very difficult for women to be taken seriously by doctors when asking for sterilisation, the proceedures are invasive and less than perfect. For example getting your tubes tied can lead to having a fertilized egg settle in the tubes, which can also lead to catastrophic results for the mother.",

The wording of this bill is so lax that using IUDs would be considered a form of abortion, and would therefore be prosecutable. \n\nCriminalizing IUDs isn\u2019t explicitly written in, but this and other bills being pushed through, are written by theocrats who can\u2019t think past their dogma long enough to write a bill that actually covers all the bases it should. These bills make a lot of legitimate reasons for abortion void by way of omission. Due to the Texas heartbeat act, a fetus with anencephaly (no brain, essentially) must be birthed, on the basis that there are 0 exceptions, save for ones that threaten the mother, provided past their little 6 week window. Anencephaly cannot be identified until much much later. Babies born with anencephaly might live past birth, however, they will only live for a few weeks or a year tops. However, as this condition is not threatening to the mother, and the fetus can still be birthed, abortion in this case is not protected under new Texas law.",

We obviously think and plan and we try to make a decision we think is best for our futures and based off of how well we think we\u2019d be as parents. A lot of thought goes into it. I only learned through having my kid that I do not like babies, (love kids just hate the baby phase) and pregnancy hormones drive me absolutely insane and make me incredibly unstable I also leaned GV runs in my family and I got it, and I learned pregnancy Fucking sucks with scoliosis as does birth. Hence I thought about it, thought about finances and thought about our living situation and relationship as a whole,. Talked to my bf about it and he agreed as well and supported my choice to not have that baby. Neither one of us regrets the decision because we\u2019ve been able to do the best we can with our daughter and she loves having all the attention on her lol. Look I\u2019m guessing your a man so you probably have no idea how pregnancy really is, how the hormones are, and how quick a pregnancy can go from normal to deadly for the mother and fetus. So that alone is enough of a reason you and all men should shut the fuck up about OUR bodies. Go be with a woman who agrees with you and leave the rest of us alone to make our own choice.",

I don't believe in an afterlife so killing someone as a form of justice isn't really a punishment since once they die it won't matter. The only difference is 1 less person alive. \n\n2. Threat of the death penalty isn't actually a deterance. It doesn't stop people from murdering. See sources below. \n\n3. This source actually sums up my third point really well: \"No one deserves to die. When the government metes out vengeance disguised as justice, it becomes complicit with killers in devaluing human life and human dignity. In civilized society, we reject the principle of literally doing to criminals what they do to their victims: The penalty for rape cannot be rape, or for arson, the burning down of the arsonist's house. We should not, therefore, punish the murderer with death.\" https://www.aclu.org/other/death-penalty-questions-and-answers \n\nhttps://deathpenaltyinfo.org/policy-issues/deterrence \n\nhttps://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/capital-punishment-deterrent-or-stimulus-murder-our-unexamined \n\n\nThere is no pro to the death sentence maybe besides one less person alive, which ends up getting replaced with another murderer (since murder rates don't change). So, that \"pro\" just essentially negates itself.\n\nOh, last point, it is quite hypocritical to say life is sacred and then pick and choose which life is sacred and which isn't.\n\nEdit: i looked it up, \"an eye for an eye,\" was also used for justice: https://www.ushistory.org/civ/4c.asp",

So not only did you use your mom as a scapegoat you then in the same exact breathe implied my mother was less significant than yours or less available. You are a dogshit and selfish human being and will be a troglodyte until the day you die not to mention a hypocrite.",

Is conception really the point at which it starts? If one believes in a deterministic worldview, then the life of the kid would start at or even before the birth of the parents, and thereby at the beginning of time. And even else, how would one be sure at conception that it wouldn't be a stillbirth or an ectopic pregnancy or anything else preventing the embryo from developing into a human?\n\nAnd with your last point \"a human life is taking shape\" but is it really? This goes back to the age-old question of what sets humans apart from other animals, and if we're talking about possible future outcomes then killing animals for meat should be illegal because they might one day evolve into beings that have more ethical value (as defined by the question of what sets humans apart from animals) than humans right?",

This whole \"it's a living being\" argument is so ridiculous that the only reason I could possibly imagine anyone truly arguing it is for religious beliefs, which I feel is pretty obviously the case. Not only is a zygote/fetus (unfamiliar with the exact terms at each stage) not able to sustain itself and maintain homeostasis, one of the defining characteristics needed to classify something as \"living,\" until roughly 22 weeks into development, but I think this further, subversive push for the integration of church and state is fundamentally against the entire point of the nation. America has, from the inception of the country, had its eyes on being a place where a person of any culture, beliefs, heritage, etc. can call home. Was that accomplished immediately? No, and it might not ever be, but we shouldn't be taking blatant steps backwards. Having any type of legislature based in a religion, something specific to only a portion of the population, is the most anti-American idea ever, as it fundamentally contradicts everything this country has ever stood for.\n\nAs many have already said, if religion is something that you truly can't set aside to see the bigger picture, then let these women \"go to hell;\" it's not like you're going with them.\n\nGoddamn I just wish people had common decency.",

Abortion as a \u201cright\u201d for an individual other than the unborn fetus is logically incompatible with that already - and would be more aptly labeled a homicide based on the same premise.

Looking for anything to slander each other. Stupidity, blind by anger and simply following the crowds like a herd of sheeps, both sides. Its pathetic. I remember when the polarizations werent this bad. I remember when I typed a post and everyone said somewhere along the lines of \"You're not a moderate unless you agree with me\".  My take on abortion is this, if its a blob of sperm n cells which is usally that until 3 or 4 months maybe shorter, then go ahead. But if its to the point where its a literal breathing entity, then leave it be, set it up for adoption.  \n\nThe whole \"woke\"  side of politics, the polarizations, false ideologies and thinking, are problems. Behind the walls of the capital, greedy, weak leaders. Filled with nepotism. Behind the Media, biasy, greed. Death on both. We are following the path of previous Republics and Democracies, mostly parallels to the Roman Republic. Each day, each min, each second, some day a Caesar or Sulla will rise, specially due to the path we are on. That figure will have a need to take full control, unite the people and have a empire under him. Not what the founding fathers wanted, but something that keeps the country alive.",

Or they use selective phrases from the Bible to use against those who don\u2019t agree with them. They hide behind Christianity to be tyrants. \n\nHad they actually abided by the Bible, they would respect and honor that free will is free will, and that it is a divine right that cannot be taken away. I just like pointing out the hypocrisy they brew and how they go great lengths to conceal their misogyny and cruelty behind a book that condemns their actions. \n\nYes, it is definitely to control women, but they\u2019re not saying those words directly but choose certain words or phrases that strongly appeal to their targeted audience and bully those who oppose them by inciting targeted audience against them as they work behind the scenes to gain/secure power over women.",

Women\u2019s bodily autonomy are more protected when they\u2019re dead.\n\nAlso your comparisons are filled with holes because Nazis and slave owners were against reproductive choices.\n\nDuring the Nazi era, different policies where established depending on the group you belonged to. Aryan women were forbidden to have abortions and severely punished when they did. There was even the Reich Central Office for the Combating of Homosexuality and Abortion. The goal behind the policies was to increase the birth rate and population of the \"Aryan race\" while decreasing the population of others, such as Polish and Slavs, and those considered a \u201cburden on German society\u201d, such as the disabled and mentally ill. Forced abortions of Eastern workers are referenced in documents from the Trials of War Criminals Before the Nuernberg Military Tribunals. \n\nSlave owners engaged in \u201creproductive coercion\u201d. Systematically forcing Black women to give birth, raping, and using them as breeding stock to produce new future slaves. It\u2019s completely inaccurate to compare prochoicers to slave owners when during that period home remedies for contraception or abortion were the only assertions of personal autonomy when these women had otherwise none.\n\nEdit: spelling",

Banning abortion will end up killing a lot of people because abortion doesn't strictly mean killing a viable fetus. It also means removal of one that's already dead.\n\nIf a woman miscarries and the fetus discharges on its own: that's an abortion. Miscarriages can happen suddenly and without warning. If she miscarries and the fetus doesn't discharge, it ***has*** to be removed before it begins rotting and causes sepsis or worse. Removing it then is also an abortion.\n\nThere was a woman recently that discovered she carried a dead fetus in her for decades (which it is genuinely a miracle she survived that) and the fetus had calcified. Removal of it then is ***still*** an abortion.\n\nI don't give a shit about if you think a fetus is a living being when it's still a single ovum cell that's just been fertilized or not, banning and criminalizing abortion is going to cause a significant number of deaths and that is far more evil than terminating a zygote.

No matter how you try and twist the cherry picked facts, that is what everything boils down to. You want to live in a world that celebrates baby killing. There is no reason to kill a baby other then because you are a trash human or something happens outside your control (aka rape, incest and the other 3.6% total) but nooo.. it's all or nothing. Funny thing is, no one on your side will put a hard time on when it's \"alive\" because at the moment of conception it's proven that it is unique DNA and starting its natural cycle of life. Sadly the science does not support your stance (your stance being your group of pro baby murder.)",

Plus, you\u2019ve got that one nut job governor who wanted to perform abortions post delivery, which I think would meet your infanticide claim. Sooooo, not a good argument. POST DELIVERY!!!!!!!

You are complaining about what you can\u2019t do to your body that is killing someone else\u2019s body. It\u2019s a philosophical non starter. There are better positions to take and I\u2019d suggest starting and staying with those. I agree about the poor people argument, I don\u2019t have a good solution to that other than contraception or abstinence. And the moving part is bs. If you don\u2019t like what\u2019s happening around you then you move. End of story. I watch hundreds of thousands of people move from Mexico and other countries to this one illegally with nothing more than the cloths on their back and two antifreeze jugs full of water. Basically everyone in America is at a better starting point than that. So yes, you can uproot your life and move if it\u2019s something that you really care about. If your at that point then your already in the minority of your state and both you and they don\u2019t want you there.

As others have said, it's not just an unthinking, unfeeling clump of cells, but one inside your body, vastly increasing your risks for a variety of issues both immediate and longer-term. Women should have the right to say \"no, I don't actually want that\".\n\n2. As for comatose patients, we do? Like, when someone's on life support for a long time and shows no chance of recovery, eventually we turn the life support off. It sucks, but in the long term I think we're better off for it since those resources can be better spent elsewhere.\n\n3. Are the skin cells you lose when you get a graze, or the white blood cells in your saliva valuable? They're alive, and not only that, they're ***human*** life! If they're not, then there's more to deserving a right to life than just having human DNA.",

Over 1 million abortions have been done in the USA . I find it hard to believe tht they were done to protect the mothers health.\n\nSo you know about 4 in a million and find it hard to believe abortions are done to protect the mother's health?\n\n>Also that is not what is being pushed it\u2019s not about protecting health it\u2019s about what the prospective mother wants. As far as I have understood most regret it . I never said I was against it . I have pointed it out that wholesale abortions as is being prompted now is dangerous to society . We have the right to abortion when on demand ,we  have wholesale simulated slaughter in our games and media . For news ,it\u2019s blood sells the news . If it doesn\u2019t bleed it\u2019s not news . The it\u2019s my body so I have the right to kill of the life that will become a human is another sickness in society . Btw everyone who knee jerks because of this statement is a result of a society that no longer thinks\n\nNgl this kinda reads as incoherent ramblings. So, to sum it up you're saying welfare should be increased to support poorer mothers to encourage them to have children in slightly less poverty than they were?\n\nI still would like to know why you don't consider miscarriage to be manslaughter if you consider abortion to be murder.",

Do you still have a right to remove me? I would say yes; you have a right to do whatever you want with your body, and if I can't survive without being attached to you, well, sucks for me. And you don't necessarily need to want me dead, in fact you could be sincerely regretful that I'd have to die, and still want me gone for a variety of reasons.",

Fun fact, a fully fertilized embryo can be just tossed out before it implants by a woman's menstrual cycle for no reason. Should we investigate every woman who miscarries and cause those women trauma and pain in having to prove that they didn't abort a fetus they wanted? It's not about not wanting them alive, it's people not having the ability to care for a child, not having the money to care for a child, not wanting to risk their life going through pregnancy for a child that they aren't going to be able to properly care for. No one gets abortions for fun, they get them because they are necessary.\n\n\nEdit: I also want to add Roe v Wade is about more than just abortions. It's about medical privacy. Overturning it is saying that you can be prosecuted for procedures/ private decisions that you make with your doctor.\n\nSo going further along pro forced pregnancy logic, people shouldnt be able to get sterilized because it's preventing human life from being born. Therefore if someone gets a medically necessary sterilization procedure they could be investigated and prosecuted for that. \n\nAbortions aren't a light decision, and people should have the human right to have their medical choices private between them and their doctors.",

Not as long as it's in the womb, late-term abortions, certainly once the fetus could be delivered and have a reasonable chance of surviving, then that's what should happen (unless there's an immediate risk to the mother, fetus, or both).\n\n2. I'm not a woman and I've never been raped, but I could imagine it being horrifying to be forced to constantly remember the rape and have your body be building something that is partly the rapist against your will inside of you.\n\n3. To be honest, if I were aborted, I wouldn't care. I wouldn't exist right now *to* care. And abortions generally are not done lightly, so sure, if my mother had needed to, I support having that right. \n\nWhat's even stranger to me is that many Christians think babies that die before a certain age go to heaven, so surely abortion is great then - the mother is sacrificing her chance (unless she sincerely repents, in which case, win-win) and the child then is guaranteed to go to heaven. In a pragmatic view, the abortion-as-birth-control idea should be the ideal, a conveyor belt straight to heaven rather than going through the trauma of the world (and potentially apostasising/never becoming Christian).",

There are signs of consciousnesses when still in the womb, but at such a low level that it\u2019s basically negligible. We don\u2019t remember being in the womb, so self awareness and memory still has ways to go even in the final weeks of pregnancy. \n\nAs to when the baby becomes a child, everyone seems to agree this is after birth.

For Republicans, killing the fetus is killing a human being so it's no surprise they consider punishments similar to that of Killing a person. For democrats a fetus is a lump of cells that can be chopped up and then done away with or sold to a corporation to do scientific research. How can you expect to be an agreement and understanding between both parties? Just let states declare their own laws and let people go to states where they can agree with the laws. There's no union anymore and it's not worth it to go to war to force other people who will never agree with you, to live under your laws and ideology.\n\nIs this really so hard to understand?",

It's just gross that anyone would defend something like this. What is wrong with you? Nobody is stepping on your snake-ass by saying we should have laws against murdering women that didn't want to have a baby. I think states should have plenty of freedom to have their laws reflect the needs of their population but I'm gonna have to draw the line at legally murdering human beings for such an ass-backwards, ignorant, and bigoted reason.\n\nIf they do go through with this bullshit, I hope that people like you will be open to similar penalties for men that masturbate because that's a LOT of dead babies. I don't see how you could possibly disagree with this if all you want to do is save the babies.

We don't have to deal with all the risks that pregnancies have. For instance, an ectopic pregnancy is one that is starting in the fallopian tube. If it's allowed to remain the baby and the mother will both die, the only way to deal with it is an abortion. Are you saying that is the woman's fault, and she should just die because she had sex?\n\nAnd telling woman to keep their legs closed to avoid pregnancy is the stupidest form of birth control ever. Sex is fun. Sex is good. Sorry don't don't get it, not anyone else's problem. Instead of telling people to be abstinent how about tell people to practice birth control and safe sex, ya?\n\nAnd I do not advocate as abortion being a form of birth control. But I do know birth control fails, and a backup plan is always useful. Besides, if you ban abortions, people will still do them. Doesnt change much, now they are just more dangerous.\n\nTldr; you get to sit on a high horse and tell other people what to do because you don't have to deal with it, and it's not your problem. I would tell you to not procreate but with this level of dumbassery you have I don't think anyone wants to with you.",

A fetus is growing inside of another person, violating their bodily autonomy, a coma patient is not. And it's not just being inside, it's ATTACHED to them, using their resources. They're not comparable situations. If someone WAS forced to let a coma patient use their bodily resources, I'd be equally on board with letting that person retain their rights to bodily autonomy by detaching themselves from that person.",

The fetus doesn't have the ability to do those actions.\n\nIt doesn't matter, you can't call yourself prolife and support the death penalty. Prolifers main argument is that *all* life is sacred, backed by ideals of Christianity. Not *some* life, *all* life, including the lives of violent criminals. Murder is wrong, regardless of if its perpetuated by the government. Christians believe that only God can truly judge a person, therefore the ultimate judgment (the death penalty) is categorically un-christian and the very antithesis of \"pro life\".\n\nNot to mention 4% of all death row inmates are innocent. So sometimes we literally murder innocent people. So *pro life*.\n\nWe're talking about people who believe life is so sacred that in extreme cases they think the results of rape and incest should be kept to term. And yet they are a-ok with executing a fully grown potentially innocent human? It's disgustingly hypocritical.",

If you murder a pregnant woman, you get charged twice. So I\u2019m not specifically criminalizing women. What I\u2019m doing is equalizing the law.\u201d",
