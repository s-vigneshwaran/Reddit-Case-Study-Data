The silicon don't give a shit and was probably ran undervolted at base clocks. The solder joints are like-new instead of worn out from thermal transitions, etc.\n\nThe only wear item, the *fan*, is worn out, yes, but a good fan can last 20 years while a bad fan can last 5 months. Buy a brand that uses good fans and you're golden.\n\n>Mining absolutely takes more electricity than gaming or editing or any other workload.\n\nPatently false. To mine, the GPU core is downclocked while ram is mildly OC'd.\n\nMy 1060 uses 60 watts to mine, out of its 120W gaming load wattage.\n\nMy 2080Ti uses 90 watts to mine, out of its 250W gaming load wattage.\n\nMy Vega 64 mined at 120 watts, out of its 300W normal peak, before I sold it for 800 bucks.\n\nGames uses WAAAAAAAAY more power.",

Chinese troops \"volunteered\" in the North Korean army and suddenly the almost-defeated enemy had 200,000 fresh reinforcements that pushed the US back to the 38th parallel, where the war started. So it was basically over nothing. McArthur wanted to preemptively nuke the Chinese and knock them out of competition in East Asia, bit Truman thought that would bring in the Russians and escalate to a nuclear war so he fired McArthur. Lots of people think that letting McArthur do what he wanted to do would have avoided conflict with China in the modern day.",

Then there\u2019s the matter of training personnel and doing tests, imagery will give away the sub\u2019s departure, satellite RF tracking and maybe comms intercepts while they\u2019re crossing will give enough hits to build a reliable track. There\u2019s more, but you should get the idea by now.\n\nIt\u2019s not a video game, there is more to this stuff than \u201csneaky big gun ship is sneaky so no find\u201d. Plenty of easier ways to set up a nuclear platform in Taiwan than to give a bunch of inexperienced Taiwanese submariners an advanced vessel for China to eventually capture.\n\nAlso the US follows the \u201cone China policy\u201d, meaning we defer those matters to Beijing. Our country officially washed their hands of this shit decades ago and just step in to make deals when it fucks with trade. The US doesn\u2019t give half a tender fuck what happens to Taiwan, certainly not enough to give China a sub.",

They have a fuck ton of people and a lot of already existing factory buildings which definitely works in their benefit.\n\nBut let's also not forget that less than 5 years ago China still couldn't make decent ballpoint pens: they were not capable of making stainless steel at a high enough quality nor could they turn that stainless steel into smooth, round balls. China imported all of the stainless steel used for making pen tips from Japan until 2017.\n\n> You're absolutely right that their navy is ass, but so is India's.

The Indian air force is equal in quality to China's best fighters, but smaller in numbers, which is irrelevant since the airfields near the India/China border are so remote that they cannot operate large numbers of aircraft regardless.",

These sanctions would destroy the Chinese economy, which is very very heavily export dependent.\n\nMeanwhile \"humanitarian relief convoys\" flying US and allied flags would defy the Chinese blockade and dare the CCP to start some shit. The Chinese would have no choice but to either let them through or bring the US and others into the war.\n\nAnd all that is assuming the US doesn't go in weapons hot on day 1, with Japan and Australia close behind.",

WW2 ya big heroes who showed up at end of war to drop a couple nukes on civilian cities and joined allies forces to defeat a single remaining country after 2 years of war exhaustion and millions of casualties lmao. Not exactly 1v1 peer warfare. That\u2019s like sending in the olympic dream team fresh off the bench after top European players whittled down Croatia for the 1st half before losing the lead. \n\nIraq is a better example, again it was a coalition- not exactly a peer to peer example. Iraq may have had large man power but severely lacked technology, quality and also weren\u2019t prepared at all. Again the most casualties were Iraqi civilians \u2026\n\nCivil war, sure great peer example 100% valid. But oldie times. \n\nI\u2019ll concede that the US has done exceptionally well at perpetual war since it\u2019s inception. However it hasn\u2019t faced a foe as rich and powerful as itself in modern times. They consistently punch down or have coalition forces/allied support/intel. If China/Russia went no holds barred bat shit crazy there could be thousands of nukes launched at the US\u2026 my POINT is that vs a modern foe who has a similar relative strength - it wouldn\u2019t be a simple and easy steam roll victory. It would be a catastrophic event leading to a brutal WW3. IN WHICH MY MONEY WOULD BE ON THE USA OF COURSE\u2026 just sayin shit wouldn\u2019t be like the 1990 Kuwait war lol.",

Most men in Afghanistan wanted Sharia law, not bullshit women's rights. So when the time came for the Afghanis to stand on their own, the number of Afghani men willing to fight for western values was tiny. The Taliban, despite being weak, only had to beat 5-10k Afghani commandos who were willing to fight.\n\nThese commandos had great support when the US was helping with air and logistics until 2020. Then the US stopped all support and told the Afghanis to do it themselves. They did not. So the commandos got fucked thanks to the incompetent and corrupt Afghani government not providing the needed support structure.\n\nBy 2021, the Taliban was flooded with new recruits who could all see that with the US refusing to fight, it was going to be a cakewalk since the natives weren't willing to stand their ground. It was just a matter of time to build up and start systematically taking territory.\n\nSo no, the US did not \"failed to successfully defeat the Taliban\", just as in Vietnam, the fault lies with the locals.\n\nThe failure on the US's part came from the political decision to try to westernize afghanistan. We never should have done that. We should have let them keep sharia law and treat women like shit. It wasn't our business to overturn that. Our only objective should have been to stop terrorism. period. If they want to stone biitches for showing a little eyebrow, that's their business.",
