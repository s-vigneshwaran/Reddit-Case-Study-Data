Of a dull, Trump supporting fool who clearly was overconfident in his critical thinking skills. So much so he didn't think he should scrutinize the possible alterior motives of those telling him he needs to look out and be aware of the alterior motives from the other guys!! And in doing so would show he's smarter than the rest that so easily fall for it. \n\nI mean, they're WARNING him and giving him the truth about the bad guys, clearly there's no way they too, could be bad guys?? That would mean none of them serve our interest or care about us....\nNo, I'm sure its just one of the sides.. I mean, it HAS to be..",

He is arguing (incorrectly) that Trump is the *legitimate* president.  Biden is illegitimately occupying the seat of power so of course he's the one who's responsible for what's going on.  He just does not have legitimate claim to the position he's occupying.\n\n(a) obviously all of that is bullshit though.\n\n(b) I think it's really important that we apply the [principle of charity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_charity) with stuff like this, because when there's clearly a reasonable way to understand what's being said and we still choose to say \"ha ha!  gotcha!  what an idiot!\" it's kind of like we're crying wolf.  and it dramatically minimizes our chance of changing people's minds when we are able to demonstrate an inconsistency between two of their beliefs -- we've primed them to say \"fucking liberals always just twist my words and make it sound different than what I mean.\"",

Anyone that still wants Trump in office is delusional but can you provide something that backs up that idea that all 74 million people that voted for him *still* support him and believe the election was fraudulent?\n\nEdit: \n\nAlso, I swear to God you can't read. \n>1.

Just not smart, because I thought a philosophy degree would be a good idea.  I am not a nihilist.\n4) Human nature is a core debate in philosophy and it has never been resolved.  Nor is it going to be resolved by a reddit argument.\n5) The overall \u201cgoodness\u201d of human existence is generally treated as an a priori assumption.  If human nature is evil, and if human existence is a net negative, then there\u2019s really no point in having a philosophy in the first place.  Even Nietzsche would have shot down your brand of nihilism (he believed existence has meaning).\n6) I\u2019d get those meds reexamined for efficacy.  Nihilism is a place of despair.

That is to say if it seems like we're smarter just because there are more people and the percentage of the population that could be considered \"smart\" hasn't actually changed much, which may be either over estimating or under estimating the past.",

Social media platforms, us vs them nationalism, how VHS beat the superior betamax, and many other examples in popular culture are literal examples of how the reptilian brain has been the driving force behind change.\n\nWhat does the advent of VHS have to do with any of this? Why is everything you say so vague? I'm talking about not supporting overt violence and seeking to subjugate others. You can't blame your basal ganglia for being a bloodthirsty intellectually dishonest populist when the entire concept of human civilisation is built upon the idea of rising above our base instincts of \"fighting, fleeing, and fucking\". We have laws and law enforcement so we wouldn't have to rely on \"fight or flight\". We have social and legal norms to regulate \"fucking\".\n\nI'm not sure what you're seeking to get out of this conversation anymore.",

Are you sure you understood what I was conveying? Those two statements aren't contradictory at all.\n\n> You proposed an impossible solution\n\nYes. My very first comment was prefaced with this. \n\n> accused 60-70% of the population as being either \"a non-interacting factor, or an actively negative (destructive) factor\n\nThere's no accusation. It's an observation.\n\n> Seemed kind of hypocritical\n\nHow is it hypocritical?\n\n> I like how you deleted the :P from the quote. Was that done for a reason?\n\nI didn't. My phone's autoselect all feature made that call. Why is that emoji so important to you? Must you waste my time asking for explanations about meaningless nonsense?\n\n> fucking. Porn was the reason VHS won over the superior technology of Betamax.\n\nVery nice. How does porn and betamax remotely interact with anything I said?\n\n> True. However you can certainly point to the basal ganglia as being a reason for voters to be motivated by the dishonest populist. Propaganda tends to target some fairly base level thinking which inspires votes.\n\nOkay, but again that's mostly irrelevant to the point I was making. The question wasn't \"why some people suck\".\n\n> and yet here we are, on a social media platform, having our own little conflict. A war of words.\n\nWe are, and this is not really what our lizard brain dictates isn't it? The very fact that we are engaged in a war of words, and not \"fight, flight, and fucking\" is part of my point.\n\n> Honestly, after your previous message I don't know either. Kinda thought I was speaking to one of the 30-40%  \n\nYou misunderstood what the 30-40 are. They aren't geniuses with all the answers. They're just regular people who can hold their nerve instead of giving into the temptation of easy hate",

Hes very serious when he says our president is an alleged practicing Jew and should be \"inpeached\" for banning \"flavored dips\". This gentleman speaks passionately of what he enjoys, and of his undying patriotism to his beloved nation. His convictions are compelling as he gives insight on the ban, and why he thinks \"its fuckin' gay\"... The nation hangs by a thread in anticipation of an official response from The White House regarding this impeachment movement.

The Trump administration is definitely moderately to blame for COVID-19\u2019s effortless travel into the United States, as well as many of the initial injuries and deaths from COVID that could\u2019ve been prevented had the situation been appropriately handled and handled sooner.\n\n* Despite the fact that US intelligence reports from as early as 31 December 2019 warned about a likely pandemic, Trump\u2019s Secretary of Health and Human Services couldn\u2019t get a meeting with Trump about COVID-19 until 18 January 2020. During that interview in January, Trump interrupted him to ask when flavoured vaping products would come back on the market. ([Source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/us-intelligence-reports-from-january-and-february-warned-about-a-likely-pandemic/2020/03/20/299d8cda-6ad5-11ea-b5f1-a5a804158597_story.html).)\n* In 2020, Trump claimed that the COVID-19 situation was completely under control in late January, after which he held several campaign rallies.\n* He claimed the virus will \u201cmiraculously go away\u201d by April 2020 ([source](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/02/donald-trump-coronavirus-warm-weather)).\n* In April, he suggested that injecting household disinfectants (e.g., bleach) could cure COVID ([source](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-disinfectants-covid-19/)).\n* In February, he claimed that COVID cases would get close to zero, he said it was under control in February, he again said it would just disappear on its own multiple times throughout early 2020, he said that people who have COVID should go to work, and he said he didn\u2019t claim responsobility ([source](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/trump-coronavirus-testing-128971)).\n* He said COVID was like the \u201cregular flu\u201d and that they\u2019d have a \u201cflu shot for [COVID] in a fairly quick manner,\u201d and he claimed he had **stopped** the COVID virus in March.\n* Trump\u2019s travel ban conveniently exempted nations that had Trump resorts ([source](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/12/trump-coronavirus-travel-europe-resorts-126808)).\n* It took until 12 March before they ordered N95 masks.\n* Trump contributed to the out-of-control racism against Asian people that caused so much violence, hate crimes, and even murders, by referring to COVID-19 as the \u201cChinese virus\u201d ([source](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/trumps-chinese-virus-tweet-helped-lead-rise-racist/story?id=76530148)) and later doubling down on it by saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not racist at all\u201d ([source](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/trump-pandemic-drumbeat-coronavirus-135392)).\n* Trump terminated the US\u2019s relationship with and its funding to the World Health Organization 16 days after the COVID-19 pandemic had been declared a state of emergency ([source](https://www.statnews.com/2020/05/29/trump-us-terminate-who-relationship/)).\n* Trump disbanded the NSC Health Unit and fired most of its employees in September 2020 ([source](https://www.kff.org/news-summary/usa-today-fact-checks-claim-trump-fired-entire-nsc-global-health-unit/)).\n\nI could go on and on about all the bad Trump and the Trump administration did during the first year of the coronavirus pandemic, but the list would be far too long. If you want to learn more about how poorly Trump handled the pandemic, I urge you to check out [Trump & the Coronavirus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuVo4fnpLC8) by Last Week Tonight, the [timeline of Trump\u2019s coronavirus responses](https://doggett.house.gov/media/blog-post/timeline-trumps-coronavirus-responses) on doggett.house.gov, and [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/g1vv5v/indictment_of_trump_and_a_warning_90_of_us/fni3sx3/) by u/Jonny_Fairbanks that also lists a brilliantly in-depth timeline of what Trump did from 18 Dec 2019 to 14 Apr 2020.",

That the market doesn't balance itself, because that would require a fully informed population that always knows what the situation for a commodity is and is willing (and able) to simply not buy when the sellers are dishonest.

In fact, many times it rewards people for hindering innovation (e.g. Microsoft destroying standards to push competition out of the market and so be able to keep their profits without any pressure to offer better products).\n\nThis is a problem I have with all ideologies: none of them work by themselves, they simply can't. This is something we have to accept if we want to move forward. What moves the world is human ambition. If we want to achieve something, then we need to be active as a society and force the rules by rewarding what we want and punishing what we don't. We want innovation? Then reward companies for attitudes that lead to innovation, and punish companies that engage in practices that hinder it.\n\nAnd this rule applies to everything. Want everyone in society to have a good salary? The market won't regulate itself, you need to intervene and reward companies that pay well and punish those who don't. Want rich people's wealth to trickle down on society? You need to reward rich people that pass that wealth down society, and punish those who don't.\n\nThis is the same for capitalism, communism, you name it. The system will not work, because we humans don't give a fuck about the system, we just want things for ourselves. That's why you need to manipulate the rules so getting things for ourselves is achieved by doing what you want us to do.\n\nAnd keep in mind that this philosophy is not mine, this is something we used to do 60 years ago. Why did the US used to tax 90% on income for the rich? Because that put pressure on that rich guy to spend his money on founding a new company or funding an investigation, instead of purchasing another private yacht. It was a way to say \"you have all that money, and it's ok as long as you use it for things that benefit society. Else we'll give it to someone else who will\".",

If crude prices skyrocket, you still have to make enough money off the gas you're selling *right now* to be able to buy the next batch of crude.  That's why even if a company bought the crude at a lower price weeks ago, the price at the pump has to go up immediately.  There is an inherent \"lag\" in the system between the raw product and retail.  The market *can't* balance itself perfectly.  It's always going to overshoot the optimal position.\n\nThat's true on the way up or on the way down.  Even if you tried to do it strictly \"at cost\", you'd still get substantial price fluctuations as the mismatch in time got accounted for in the system.  The best you could do is somewhat mute them by running at a temporary loss and then making it back again later.",

Account for inflation that's $5.37 today. Sorry you are dead wrong on that. Also you forget many states have raised gas taxes since 2008 a few times. Oil companies do not set prices at the pump. Gasoline is also a stock market commodity. Even so you still have to account for increases in prices to transport and store gasoline. The trucker transport cost are much higher today than it was in 2008. Nobody is \"collecting a difference\"  Exxon hasn't reported anything for q1 yet so that doesn't mean anything until they actually report it. Even if they report that or higher so what? They among many others lost money in 2020. Also the profit comes from lack of investment and much leaner operations. I would be shocked if this year isn't more profitable than 2008 for most oil companies. Simply because if you compare spending in 2008 to now there's a stark difference. You would not believe the waste that went on in the oilfield in 2008. As I said before it's much more complex than just what most people think.",

While the oil and gas companies raised the prices because their shareholders basically told them to, we also have the Russia invasion and COVID to blame.  \n\nRussia\u2019s invasion of Crimea and the subsequent sanctions basically removed 10-15% of the world\u2019s oil supply from the market. What happens when supply drops but demand doesn\u2019t? Prices go up.  \n\nOPEC cut production during the pandemic amid slowed demand, and Trump signed a deal with the Saudi\u2019s to limit output. Now that the pandemic is over and demand has spiked HARD, we have a jump in prices because production simply hasn\u2019t gone up to meet the current demand. For example, Saudi produced 12M barrels/day before the pandemic and now produce 10M/day. Demand has risen close to pre-pandemic levels but output hasn\u2019t kept up and probably won\u2019t for a while as the countries producing the oil make money hand over fist.",

I'm a US citizen who usually tries to overcompensate for the other stupids.\n\nIf it helps in your understanding: Much of this appears to be rooted in an overinflated sense of self worth. Self worth _can_ be good. In moderation. For instance, It can be valuable to say, \"I am an individual, and I matter.\" which it seems many Americans are learning to do. Their parents or grandparents probably did a poor job of fostering self-worth and independence concepts. A person finding their place in the world, and knowing that they matter - there is real value in that, and not everybody does that well.\n\nThe danger comes when these people take it too far and it evolves into statements like \"I am the only human being that matters.\" Or \"My perception is the only truth.\" Or \"Every culture is like my culture.\" Or \"There are no other cultures. I only recognize 'normal' and 'foreign'.\" These narcissistic mindsets breed misunderstandings like, \"What do you mean that hotel doesn't accept _dollars_!?\"\n\nSo thank you for tolerating those dummies. Hopefully in a generation or two they'll have learned to balance out their self worth vs empathy issues.",

So how does he unite both of these contradictory beliefs? Well, he claims that the moon program we all know was fake and was recorded, but that at the same time there was another secret moon program that actually made progress and landed on the moon (and made these secret discoveries). Why would we hide a moon landing by faking another moon landing? I have no fucking idea, but they guy is confident in both of these facts.",

He zeroes in on a specific point that somebody is making and refuses to let them get off of the topic until they can answer for that specific point.

The woman piped up and said \"I have a different opinion on this\", almost to try to save the guy from having to keep talking. Jason said, \"Just a moment here\", and then gestured back to the guy. It was clear he was locked on to that phrase and point the guy was making.\n\nThe strategy, as I see it, is that a lot of these conspiracy people LOVE to change the subject as soon as they get caught in some nonsense, making the claim that \"You just need to see the bigger picture, look over here.\" And he doesn't ever let them get off topic because it takes away their main strategy for deflection.

Liberals aren't teaching kindergarten children sex-ed.\n\nIt's 100% non-stop misdirection, to keep their voters as dumb and angry as possible and focused on fake issues instead of the things that the GOP actually care about like, making as much money for themselves, Corporations, and the 1% as humanly possible. - which involves raises taxes on the middle & lower-class, gutting public schools, social security, and health-care.",

Since they believe Trump rightfully won the election, and since they believe Biden\u2019s inauguration was invalid, they therefore believe Trump never left office\u2014even though Biden is the one in the White House making decisions.  Kinda like when there\u2019s a coup and the rightful government becomes a government in exile.\n\nThis isn\u2019t how the mechanics of our government work, there is no dispute over the date of inauguration, and Trump definitely did NOT win the election.  Please don\u2019t mistake me as saying the Qs are right about anything.  I\u2019m just saying they aren\u2019t all so stupid that they lack surface level consistency.",

After a good interview, the subject generally likes the interviewer.\n\nIf you watch the great interviewers (Larry King, Barbara Walters, etc), they go out of their way to ask questions that are hard and relevant while avoiding shaming or embarrassing their subject.

Believe it or not everyone needs to think before they speak. If you don\u2019t give people time to think before they speak they will never learn that they are wrong, they will jsut get mad at you for interrupting them constantly, which is exactly what the interviewer was doing. He was interrupting the man.\n\nI have no issues with what is being said, not an opinion that I want to state about this matter. All I\u2019m saying is that if we are going to interview random people on the street with a camera and microphone, you guys need to accept that 1. Some people have stage freight and need time to calm down 2. Some people have anxiety which makes their minds run a mile a minute 3. Some people like to think through their responses and so it takes time to answer and 4. You cannot interrupt someone midway through their response. \n\nIt\u2019s just rude. It\u2019s not a strategy, it\u2019s being a dickhead. He let him finish his sentences, but he couldn\u2019t have the decency to tell the guy to stay on topic at the END of his sentence.\n\nWe don\u2019t even know what the guy was going to say because the entire video is just him interrupting the dude!",

The choice we make - imprison them or don't - is a key factor in their fate.\n\nEverything you said only applies in a non-deterministic scenario. In a deterministic world, it would be pointless to imprison the murderer because his future murders have already been determined. Fate has already decided the course of events. Imprisoning him will change nothing. Our choices would be irrelevant.\n\n\n> They're isolated *from you*, but that just means they're talking to other people who agree with them or are inclined to agree with them.

You isolate them and keep them controlled, instead of letting them free to spread their cancer everywhere. There will always be people like this dude, the only sustainable solution is containment.\n\n> I don't see the relevance.  I believe in democracy because it produces better government than other systems and makes the government reactive to the populace.\n\n*Only if free will is a thing.

Lots of things change without any choice involved.\n\nLike what? If it isn't a choice, what changes the mind of people? Random coincidence? Act of God?\n\nOf course it's a choice.

If the second domino doesn't fall then the third domino doesn't fall.  If the murder isn't imprisoned, he kills again.\n\nIf you say \"Imprisoning him changes nothing, it's deterministic, let's not bother imprisoning him, not his fault\" then he goes out and kills again! \n\n>Yes I know.

If A is determined to be fated to die at the hands of B, it's gonna happen no matter what. How does imprisonment help?\n\nDeterrence clearly exists.  Imprisonment might help because if A is imprisoned B might very well *not* be fated to die at A's hands.  And C might not kill D because he thinks \"If I kill D I'll go to prison, look what happened to A\".\n\n>How? What is good and what is evil in a story where everything is pre-determined? Is an actor evil for playing the role of villain in a movie? If I was born with the express purpose of doing something, how can I be evil for fulfilling it? Morality in a deterministic universe is an oxymoron.\n\nA movie isn't real, life is.  People experiencing happiness or pain and suffering is real, it matters.\n\nIf your destiny - i.e. the choices you make in the circumstances that occur in your life - is to kill an innocent person for your own pleasure then you are an evil, or at least you will be in the future.  I don't know why you think that's incompatible with determinism.  Your destiny isn't independent of your choices, even if those choices are predictable.\n\nMaybe think about it like this\n\nTomorrow a meteor strike hits my house, the debris hits my head, gives me brain damage.  The brain damage turns me into a total psychopath, I just want to torture torture torture.  I've had no choice in the matter.

It's the only viable solution. By isolating them you limit their sphere of influence and ability to radicalise others. It is no coincidence the role social media has played in helping radicals recruit, and there is no doubt that identifying and banning thesw channels of communication hugely helps cut down on the problem. Ultimately, isolation is the only viable solution. Integration of the cancer into the rest of the body is a recipe for doom.

And it's a conscious choice to do all of this. This is exactly what I mean by people choosing what to believe. It's like those Nazi war trials where those cowards went \"I was just a clerk, I didn't know they were gassing all news who were disappearing!\". Intentional ignorance is a *choice*.

Because of this, Wyoming, for example, gets 3 votes. California has 55. But because EC votes that are cast are determined by the states popular vote, one Wyoming EC vote represents 150,000 Wyoming voters whereas one California EC vote represents 500,000 California voters. So to impact EC ballots, California voters need to cast three ballots to equal one Wyoming voter's ballot, making WY essentially worth 3 times more.\n\nThis design was created to strengthen the vote of the less populous states, which happen to mostly vote Republican.",

Race and racism was never a thing until it became politically expedient for those in power. People did not use to be white and black. \n\nW.E.B du Bois writes that \"The discovery of personal whiteness among the world's peoples is a very modern thing\". It's not a natural phenomenon. In South Africa, the apartheid regime very successfully divided black people by classifying some of them as 'African' and others 'Coloured'. It was a purely artificial divide, but it worked wonderfully for them, because it destroyed working class solidarity and created a nice buffer to protect the ruling classes from revolt.",

Like if you want to point out how dumb his view is, let him make his view known.\n\nHe was about to reveal how Joe Biden is responsible even though Trump is \"still president\" and I really wanted to hear his \"logic\" lol",

They have not  \ndeveloped and thought through their ideas as much as most people have. Thus  \nalmost anything can be found in their heads if their authorities put it there, even stuff  \nthat contradicts other stuff. A filing cabinet or a computer can store quite inconsistent  \nnotions and never lose a minute of sleep over their contradiction. Similarly a high  \nRWA can have all sorts of illogical, self-contradictory, and widely refuted ideas  \nrattling around in various boxes in his brain, and never notice it\"\n\n\\-Bob Altemeyer, *The Authoritarians* (2006)",

This whole \"Trump is still the president* is far from a fringe Conservative view. \n\nA bunch of these idiots invaded the Capitol because they believed in it so much.

Conservative social media was saturated with this rhetoric, and it's still commonly found in all popular Conservative hangouts on Reddit (take a look yourself).\n\n> Moreover, both sides think the other has \"rejected reality in favor of delusion\". This is all such tired shit.\n\nTo be honest, who gives a shit what these sides \"think\". It is an objective fact that Trump is not president, and if he was it makes no sense for Biden to be responsible for gas prices. This is a made up delusion. Now these deluded people can accuse everyone else of being deluded as well, doesn't mean that their accusation is credible or valuable.\n\nSay A steals something from B. The matter goes to court, and each party accuses the other of thievery. In your infinite wisdom, what would you do as the judge? Analyse the facts of the case and make an informed decision? Or declare both of them the same, and reject any decision because \"this is all tired bullshit and a *both sides* problem\".",

No one gives a fuck about poor Joe its almost adult abuse. What is happening in the United States right now will make people realise much more that Donald Trump wasn\u2019t that bad. And ever since the democratic party runs the country goes down the drain. He said that people need to wake up which is true. You probably love to disagree with me and think i am biased but it is obvious that the majority of the Americans get brainwashed by the media to believe everything that wants good for the country is a Nazi xenophobic monster which is absolutely not the case but most people only hear their friends talking who are also misinformed and not interested in politics but they scream the loudest about it. You can even see this reporter is extremely left biased and frame this person like he is dumb thats how the interview start\u2019s instantly. Which makes this person nervous and makes him say things then also the reporter puts words in his mouth and interrupt him with questions that frame this person. He didn\u2019t had a chance to explain. If you disagree to what i am saying here you are just Biased and ignorant.",

Because Americans pay insane amounts still today on medication.\n\n- he was nominated to win the nobel price of peace for wanting to create peace in Israel \n\nHe had plans for better sustainable energy in a cleaner way then windmills the plan where even Elon musk is talking about to create reactors. Which is much much cheaper and doesn\u2019t have to tax the citizens for.\n\n- he had no war and didn\u2019t want any war with any country the only thing he did is send a rocket to Iran isis leader who attacked American ambassade. He also didn\u2019t want to involve in any war. \n\n- rent lowered in many states \n\n- he wanted to build a wall to keep ILLEGAL immigrants out but also Mexican gangs and the cocaine trade from Bolivia to the united states where many many people die and cars get burned down for. \n\n- he promoted science that would help America and help invest in that.\n\n- low tax smaller government more freedom for the people to interact. \n\nNext to that listen this \n\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/nl/podcast/donald-trump-on-ww3-talking-to-putin-and-joe-rogan/id1582758729?i=1000553486320\n\nThe media tries to make him look like a insane extreme dangerous person which he absolutely is not. Well yea he has some ego which i think sound arrogant sometimes but if you know how much respect this man gained through the years as hardworking man Kevin Oneil from sharktank has a bigger ego.\n\nThere is nothing wrong in this man he wants to do good and seen as that thats all and it can come over as showoff",

You don't need media to tell you that. \n\nA few examples;\nHe claimed to already have a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare while on the campaign trail. It would've made healthcare cheaper and would've covered more people. He claimed he'd do this as soon as free was in office. I'll give him credit, he started right away but it collapsed just as quick. \"Who knew healthcare was so complicated?\" Meanwhile, the republican party had 7 years to come up with a decent replacement and didn't. They scrounged together a shitty replacement that would've done more harm than good and Trump put his stamp of approval on it. When that failed, he claimed to have another plan but dissent wasn't to release it until his second term. \n\nUnemployment rates were already trending downwards, nothing he did had any significant effect on those numbers, he just took credit for them. No one has shown me what abetting he took to make it drop more than what it was. \n\nMost military experts agreed north Korea was not a threat to the US but maybe to their allies in the region. Trump didn't stop anything. \n\nTrump didn't try to being peace to Israel, he helped two countries sign a trade agreement. Not a peace deal. Only he called it that.\n\nHe didn't start a new war but he expanded drone bombings in the wars they were already in. He had approved more drone bombings in his first two years than Obama had in all 8 of his years. Trump then rescinded a law that forced him to publish civilian deaths caused by those drone strikes when his numbers also increased. \n\nI'll also need some sources on the lower rent, all the data I've seen shows rent steadily increasing over the last 10+ years. \n\nHe also ignored multiple sources that showed the money for the wall (that he stole from the military) would be better spent on newer technology, more people, and in other places. The wall was a PR stunt.\n\nI'll definitely need more info on Trump taking with Putin and ending the cold war in 2015 since he didn't take office until 2017 and the cold war ended in 1991.",

One thing i can tell is that a lot of left wing states were not working well and resist working also maybe a funny thing Trump doesn\u2019t like republicans he even considered to be a democrat but he thought the democratic party was way worse. and then we come to a whole other thing which is the main factor behind all of this and that is cultural Marxism you literally see it everywhere deep implemented in the roots of the system.

I offered a charitable interpretation of those statements. Maybe the rest of the interview makes it more clear, but I have the suspicion that both the interviewer as well as the people posting this clip only want to ridicule and are not interested in the position of that guy. The goal seems to be to find somebody you can feel superior to, not to actually engage what they are saying.\n\nI even disagree with the charitable interpretation of his position btw. Why do I nevertheless go out of my way to try and interpret his statements as rationally as I can? Because I believe in intellectual honesty and dialectics. I hate misrepresentations **on all sides**. I hate rhetoric obfuscations **on all sides**. I hate straw men **no matter who uses them**.",

It says the Trump campaign chairman had regular contact with a Russian intelligence officer and says other Trump associates were eager to exploit the Kremlin\u2019s aid, particularly by maximizing the impact of the disclosure of Democratic emails hacked by Russian intelligence officer.\n\nYou mean that \"hoax\"?",

What I said is contextualized by being from a country that is not rich in oil. You're right that two sentences doesn't paint the whole picture. So I won't read too much from it if it were me. It's just two sentences that barely expresses the complexity of the issue we are trying to uncover. \n\nAlso there is no point  looking at this in black and white. I am in no way saying that Biden is clean on this. My main hope is is that for people to be more open to discuss and not be easy to dismiss differing opinions. Delusional left-wingers and right-wingers surely exist and I don't care for both. I prefer that people on the opposite sides take the time to lay out fundamentals of their argument on why they are for or against anything. I hope to see what differing priorities they have to argue for different things. \n\nFor example, I'm very much in favor of transition our country's energy production to 100% renewable due to its better long term environmental benefits. However, the rate at which the energy demand is increasing cannot be supported by the rate at which renewable energy production is being built. That said, it's inevitable that at least for now, we need to rely on coal for the majority of our energy needs. Following this, a number of coal power plants have been newly opened despite the country's commitment to lessen carbon emissions in the next decades.",

When supply goes down and demand remains the same the price goes up. It\u2019s basic economics. He also passed through multiple multi trillion dollar bills causing inflation. This causes the price of everything to go up. So I ask how isn\u2019t it his fault?",

They had stored supplies to last a very long time. Also, it\u2019s only US leases that he shut down, not all global ones, since he doesn\u2019t have the power to do so. All this did was stop the 8th largest oil producer from being able to produce *as much* oil. It wasn\u2019t a 100% shutdown. Also, before the impacts of Ukraine and Russia (the number one producer of oil), there were price hikes seen globally. It\u2019s not just the US that\u2019s effected, and it\u2019s not even the place that\u2019s MOST effected. Some places have $4 a liter. Not a gallon, A LITER. The short of all of this is that Biden not granting oil mining in the US doesn\u2019t do jack to an already huge industry, in the 8th place country. If he could s o m e  h o w limit all other countries, then yes, it would be his fault. Buuut, he can not, sooooo, ya know, it isn\u2019t. \n\nTL;DR: Biden can\u2019t control other governments. The US is #8 in production, and isn\u2019t producing 0%. All areas have price hikes, and the oil tycoons admitted PUBLICLY that they are doing it on purpose. \n\nSo, I ask, how IS it his fault?",
