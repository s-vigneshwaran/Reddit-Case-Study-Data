I know that the capacity for thought is limited on this website but I didnt think that your personal biases towards how you believe what other people think is that limited.\n\nI think that january 6th is a tradgedy. I think it's a tradgedy that hundreds of people fell for a political stunt by an egomaniac and that so many people ended up being swept into political action by mob mentality. I think it's really shitty that all those congressmen were entrenched in fear by an angry mob. You don't have access to my thoughts so dont jump to conclusions on what I am thinking.\n\nAnd by the historical definition of nihilism being: \"the rejection of all religious and moral principles, in the belief that life is meaningless.\" You are in fact acting like a nihilist douchebag regarding your stance on thinking that people being tricked into pushing a political movement by an egomaniac billionaire deserves death.\n\nYou're the only person being a twat. You started an argument over preconceived notions and patronize others on a false premise. Again, I really hope you get some therapy or read some self help books. You really do come off as a miserable piece of turd.",

But using that to try to say both sides are the same is absolutely wrong, and even worse, it gets used in bad faith arguments all the time. Both sides suck in their own individual ways but Republicans are much better at toeing the line, and presenting unified and strong messages. They operate in a much more cohesive way, which brings them closer to homogeny than the severely splintered Democrats. There's plenty of nuance, but Republicans and their policies are demonstrably worse for regular people from low to middle class. It cannot even be argued statistically. \n\nAn analogy would be Democrats stole the pizza you were going to have for dinner, but left you one slice for a family of 5. Republicans, however, stole your entire pizza, then took a shit on your table..but bc they said it was motivated by Christian values, the conservative families eat it and say thank you.\n\nRemember when your girl Hillary lost the election and Democrat extremists overtook the Capitol bc they were so butthurt and detached from reality?",

In 2019, 228 American police officers died by suicide. There are 700k cops in the US total, so that's a suicide rate of 33 per 100k cops.\n\nSo 4 cops killing themselves total from two combined large police forces, isn't particularly unusual.",

You exist only to regurgitate propaganda fed to you by marxists.\n\nIn addition, even if a cop DID kill himself because of 1/6 instead of it being an obvious coincidence, the more likely explanation would be that he was disgusted with the jackbooted behavior of his fellow officers in attacking the protestors.",
