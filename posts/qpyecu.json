You could maybe say realistically it is a journey on the path to true equal rights, but it would never be the destination of someone promoting black rights. And suggesting it is the only option they have and would prefer slavery is just nonsensical. \n\nVegetarianism is the same in this analogy. It is still about commodifying and exploiting animals and is not at all equivalent to veganism. It is not an end goal someone who cares about animals rights and suffering would ever dream of.",

Anything you do is your own fault, it's not on them just because you say it is. They didn't force you to go against your beliefs, you used them as an excuse to.\n\n\nLike if I knew someone who was also a feminist, but found them unpleasant to interact with because they opposed something I did that wasn't in line with feminism, why would my reaction be to threaten to go beat a woman to get back at them. It makes no sense, you're just proving them right. \n\n\nOut of the general population vegetarians reported openly opposed vegans the most because they felt judged by them for not going all the way. Let's be real they were judged lmao, but that doesn't change the fact that vegetarians still took more of a stance against veganism than omnivores and therefore are often in the way of progress. When veganism comes up I definitely see vegetarians telling omnivores who might otherwise go vegan, not to because we're extreme.

I know how often and needlessly they produce eggs. It hurts them not at all to collect the excess eggs and consume them. I promise you, our chickens were happy and content, and we had more eggs than we knew what to do with.

For instance, I used to be vegetarian, got burned out, and gave up for years. This time around, I started out just banning pig from my diet, then cow, then all mammals, then turkey, then chicken, now I only eat fish. Waiting until I\u2019m comfortable that I can maintain it before deciding to cut that out next. My close friend who is vegan now employed that strategy himself as he transitioned over the course of a few years and recommended it to me.\n\nIt\u2019s important to recognize that 1) People are imperfect, 2) It\u2019s really difficult to act morally about things we don\u2019t see the direct effects of (farm animal deaths, tragedies in other countries, etc) because it\u2019s natural to dissociate from your feelings about distant things like that, 3) everything in our culture pressures people into eating meat, 4) that healthy plant based diets require significant time and money, and 5) it\u2019s better to do what you can handle than lie to yourself and try to force yourself to do something you can\u2019t handle.\n\nWhen someone says \u201cI would be a vegan, but\u2026\u201d don\u2019t hate them, encourage them.

The person that we're talking about literally said they already accept that we shouldn't do harm to animals because they feel pain, and that they ignore that moral obligation because they enjoy eating meat. The reason this can be compared to a human killing another human is because we also, as a society, accept that that is morally wrong. But in that case we don't accept that people do it just because they like it. You're trying to get into a debate with me that is a complete non-sequitur from the conversation we were having.\n\nMy premise is that if you *already accept* that killing animals is wrong because they feel pain, which again, the person that we're discussing did, then simply adding onto the end of that \"but I like to and I'm selfish\" is a sociopathic way to think. \n\nThe premise that the conversation began with was already under the assumption that all parties agree that it's wrong to kill animals because they feel pain. *That isn't even a statement that I agree with*, that was the other meat-eating party's statement.\n\n So you're jumping into a conversation where you don't even understand the premise.

You use guilt, lies, and exaggerations to psychologically bully other people into seeing your point of view. You didn't even explain why you think your viewpoint is correct.\n\nAnimals for the most part could not give a single care about any of us. You impart these attributes of innocence on them, yet they supposedly don't interact with morality at all. The REAL truth is that eating animals or not, choosing which animals to eat is a matter that has nothing to do with morality. It is something chosen by individual societies, and then we make up BS religious reasonings for why our way of eating is best or most moral. Veganism is a similar religion.\n\nAs others have pointed out and you have smashed your face against, humans suffer for you to consume your vegan diet. Yet I know you gladly scarf down all of it gleefully, so elated that no animal was harmed.\n\nNews flash: so many animals die so that you can pretend to be vegan. You have no idea what products you have bought over the years have contributed the worst to suffering. You literally can never know. Anyone or any company that has told you that you can trust them is lying. No, instead, you want to come on the internet and lecture people about patting themselves on the back, all the while doing the same.\n\nWant to know why I have no problem eating meat?\n\nBecause they'd eat me too if they were in my position, and they wouldn't care. Nor should they. You're not vegan because you're a good person. It's because you're full of yourself.",

In my  region we have done promising experimentation with including wild boar in some of the meals served at schools and in elderly care. The limit for CO2 emissions allowed per portion is currently set at 2 kg, portions with boar only reach 0,15 kg CO2. \n\nAnd the boar population is still growing rapidly. It used to be native here in Sweden but went extinct several centuries ago likely as a consequence of domestic pig farming, then they were reintroduced in the 1900s within enclosed areas. 50 years ago they started \"escaping\" into the wild (likely released). 17 years ago there were an estimated 40,000 of them. 10 years ago there were ~100,000. Now there are more than 300,000 of them.",

I didn't say their feelings are real. We humans just project our own feelings onto them. Of course animals feel fear, joy, etc. That doesn't mean their feelings are relevant, since they are not human.\n\nAnything on this planet only has a  value if we humans give it one.

When foraging, you're typically looking for anything edible.\n\nSo you can go \"foraging\" and get mushrooms, but if you're like \"damn, son.

Would it be OK with someone forcefully impregnating you, taking your offsprings away, and collecting your bodily fluids through a machine?
