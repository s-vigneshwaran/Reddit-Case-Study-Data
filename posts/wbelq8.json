She had her first daughter at 16, then her daughter had a baby at 19. \n\nMy grandma was 41 (actually maybe 42 because her birthday is between mine and my mom\u2019s) when I was born. She was 19 and then my mom was 22. \n\nI\u2019m 23, my life (although actually on a really good path) feels like a dumpster fire and I\u2019m breaking the cycle because I know I\u2019m not in a position where I\u2019m ready to take care of kids given that I can barely take care of myself. But I lucked out by having a midwife mom who was able to help me navigate through the wide variety of contraception options and pick the best one for me - while also forcing me at 17 to take responsibility for making my own doctor\u2019s appointment to get the implant because \u201cif you think you\u2019re responsible enough for sex, you\u2019re responsible enough to take care of your own contraception\u201d - and who was always very open about discussing safe sex even well before I was sexually active. By the time I was sexually active she was there as support for me, and still would\u2019ve been if my bc failed at any point, but made it explicitly clear that she expected me to take the lead on being responsible enough to carry out the options we had discussed. \n\nDespite the rocky relationship I have with my mom nowadays, which will hopefully be mended, I think she did some A+ parenting for her nearly adult daughter by encouraging me to step up to the plate and take control of my reproductive health.",

Well after he\u2019s born we go with the PO method, because if it took 10 months trying for a baby then it\u2019ll be impossible to get preggy when ur actively trying not to, right? WRONG. Nobody told me precum can have sperm in it and baby #2 was conceived 3 months after the birth of #1\ud83d\ude02 but I learned my lesson, am on proper birth control, believe I am a very good mom not only for my age, but in general, and don\u2019t plan on having another kid ever again.",

Natural selection, the process by which the strongest, the smartest, the fastest, reproduced in greater numbers than the rest, a process which had once favored the noblest traits of man, now began to favor different traits. Most science fiction of the day predicted a future that was more civilized and more intelligent. But as time went on, things seemed to be heading in the opposite direction. A dumbing down. How did this happen? Evolution does not necessarily reward intelligence. With no natural predators to thin the herd, it began to simply reward those who reproduced the most, and left the intelligent to become an endangered species.",

With two kids, no help, and crazy daycare costs, it's also too late to get serious about an education / trade. Not that you'd be willing to put in the work, anyways.\n\nYou're financially bleeding dry. I'm not sure what the purpose of this post was-- a thinly-veiled cry for help? Doesn't matter; you and I both know your two remaining options:\n1) lock down a man with sufficient income\n2) porn / onlyfans\n\nThe modus operandi here on r/roastme is \"Haha you have an OnlyFans,\" but you're a special case. If you can't satisfy (1), then your two kids will go hungry if you don't sell your body. Let me be more descriptive: if your OnlyFans doesn't take off (statistics again: it won't), you'll need to _suck cock_ to survive. Do you swallow?\n\nTo be frank: satisfy (1) or put your kids up for adoption. You've set them up for failure, but you don't need to drag them with you through your financially miserable life.",

There's nothing to like about it, and most of the resentment is directed at the father, the kids will be a living reminder to society of how unreliable BIPOCs are as fathers.",
