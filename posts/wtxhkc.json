Brackets makes a group, + or - makes a group, put things on a division line makes a group. Some operators (integral and similar) also makes a group. Everything inside a group is taken sequencially.\n\nEven better is writing things down by hand first and never just write '8/2\u00d72'. The 8/2 should be written as a horizontal line, 8 top 2 bottom.

There is no right order of actually solving it, as long as you don't break any rules. You can teach the lesson of PEMADS, but there are more generalized ways of teaching that lesson instead of saying \"you have to do this and this first\" when in reality you can do whatever, just know the \"rules\".\n\n2 \\* 2 (3 + 3 \\* 2). In my eyes I just look at this one like this: The result of whatever is outside the brackets is going to be multiplied by whatever the results inside are. You can go about solving that however you like, like moving stuff in and out as you please as long as you follow the necessary rules. I don't have to solve the contents of the brackets first, I can multiply the 2 \\* 2 outside first, and then do the bracket. I can also move one of the 2s I have outside the brackets into it, making the (3 + 3 \\* 2) a (3 + 3 \\* 4), still being a \"legal\" move.\n\nSeeing as I have never had PEMADS in my education my whole comment might be irrelevant because I don't know how it is taught in education, but as far as my understanding goes, PEMADS is telling you what to solve first, when in reality you can solve whatever you want. You don't have to solve the brackets first, that's completely up to you. You don't have to go around remembering PEMADS (not like it's a big deal to just remember PEMADS, but still).\n\nWhy not teach the actual contents of the maths and how it works, instead of limiting yourself to some framework which isn't even the only way to solve things? You'll still have to learn mostly the same things, don't get me wrong, but why limit your understanding when you can rather be taught that: An equation is really just built up of other smaller equations. 2(3\\*2) is 2 equations. You just have to find a way to solve the parts of the equation to get to the whole thing. You can get there however you want, you don't have to look at PEMADS to figure out how you can get there, just know what is legal and what is not. The brackets can come after you do a bunch of other stuff, even though parentheses is first in PEMADS. I imagine this will get people to actually understand maths instead of being \"rule bots\" that just remember a lot of rules instead of understanding how it works or how things actually tie together.\n\nIf PEMADS is something entirely different than what I've described feel free to hmu with that though, but I feel like I've got a decent grasp of it by searching online, but then again I don't know how it is taught in the classroom.\n\nThanks for coming to my TED talk.\n\nedit: typo",

We teach it alongside teaching understanding of the concepts of mathematics. Math has rules and GEMA is one way of helping to foster a beginnings of the concept and beginnings of the understanding of how to solve complex equations. Math is very complex and while understanding the concepts come easy for some, they don't for others and that is the purpose of using mnemonics like GEMA/PEMDAS. It is an aid, not the rule itself.\n\nI would personally avoid writing TED talks on something that you have not had first hand experience with as a student or educator.",

                  "text": "It's not that simple.\n\nYou probably think that left-associativity is a hard rule of mathematics because you were raised in (or least spent most of your life in) a post-digital world. The vast majority of programming languages and other computing contexts that process infix expressions have chosen to use left-associativity for arithmetic operators. There's a good reason for that choice: it _mostly_ maps to the existing informal conventions for interpreting written notations. But the key words there are \"mostly\" and \"informal\".\n\nThe core issue is that mathematical notation predates mathematical formalism. Modern mathematical notation evolved in a very ad-hoc manner over several centuries. You'd find it fairly recognizable by the mid 18th century, but it has roots going back to at least the late 15th century. For a very long time, mathematical notation was largely just rhetorical. All that really mattered was that your immediate audience understood what you meant.\n\nThe seeds of semantic formalism were sowed around 1860 with the successor function and later the Peano axioms (1890s). Those seeds didn't really bloom until the 1920s under the cultivation of Hilbert. It was also around this time that folks like Alan Turing and Alonzo Church started to work out the beginnings of formal semantics. It wasn't until about the mid-1950s with the work of John Backus and Noam Chomsky that those theories really came together into something fairly complete and practicable.\n\nSo there's at least about a 200-year gap between modern algebraic notation and any formal concept of a [well-defined expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-defined_expression) or [well formed formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-formed_formula). The result is notation rife with ambiguities.\n\nEven a simple statement like `1 + 2 + 3` is _grammatically_ ambiguous. We could parse this as `(1 + 2) + 3` (left-associative) or `1 + (2 + 3)` (right-associative). You don't notice the ambiguity because it doesn't matter: addition happens to be _mathematically_ associative, so the two derivations are equivalent.\n\nThere's an overall preference for left-associative parsing in our informal conventions simply because the notation evolved mostly in Europe with left-to-right written languages. This makes subtraction fairly uncontroversial. You'll get almost universal agreement that `1 - 2 - 3` means `(1 - 2) - 3`, not `1 - (2 - 3)`. But the solidus `/` derives from the Arabic horizontal division bar, which could capture sub-expressions. This shakes our confidence a bit when it comes to a statement like `1 / 2 / 3`.\n\nEven worse is `1 / 2x`. Instinctively, we want implicit multiplication to be right-associative. But in that case, we're mixing left-associative and right-associative operators with the same precedence in the same infix expression. That's ambiguous any way you slice it. In fact, if you attempt to do this with custom infix operators in a language like Haskell, the compiler/interpreter will [yell at you](https://bugfactory.io/blog/custom-infix-operators-in-haskell/) because _there is no way to resolve this ambiguity_.",

This is because TI-82s are programmed to give implied multiplication via juxtaposition a higher order of operations priority than other operations and TI-83s are not.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/iZB3gSX.jpg\n\n    6/2(1+2)\n\nOlder people interpret the problem with implied multiplication via juxtaposition having a higher operations priority:\n\n    6/(2*(1+2)) = 1\n\nYounger people who have used TI-83 onward interpret implied multiplication as having equal priority:\n\n    (6/2)*(1+2) = 9\n\nI suspect this is the real reason so many people get different answers on those silly math problems that get posted on social media.  Older people prioritize implied multiplication via juxtaposition without even thinking a out it and younger people never learned math that way.  It's a generational thing.  A small programming change on the the TI-83 calculator changed the way an entire generation understands math.\n\nSeveral years ago I found old employee forum posts from TI discussing the programming change.

Do they think that\u2026 math questions can have different answers depending on whether you use a calculator or do it in your head?\n\nI think there's some cheap calculators that use the previous result with the next operator and number. Typing 20 makes the previous result 20. Typing + 20 becomes 20 + 20 = 40. Typing - 10 becomes 40 - 10 = 30. Times 0 becomes 30 times 0 = 0. The last two bring the total to 4. But yes, with the order of operations (\"using your brain\" or a decent calculator), you get 44.",

That is why the subtraction only distributes to the term right after it, not everything after it.\n\nThe explicit precedence would look like this: (20) + (20) + (-1 * 10 * 0) + (2) + (2)\n\nOne way to look at it when there aren't explicit parentheses/brackets is any time you have an addition or a subtraction you imagine parenthesis around everything until the next one, because you have to reduce whatever is in there first because it takes higher precedence.",

Out of those multiplication has the highest priority, while the other two operations have the same priority.\n\nWe calculate the operation 10x0 = 0. Note that -0 isn't a thing, we still haven't dealt with the subtraction here so we still gotta carry the minus in front of the zero.\n\nThe equation now looks like\n\n>>20 + 20 - 0 + 2 + 2\n\nFrom here on, since all operations have the same priority, we can do them in any order. Usually it's done from left to right since that's the way we read. We add the two twenties and get \n\n>>40 - 0 + 2 + 2\n\nNote, we are finally gonna deal with the minus and the 0. Forty minus zero is still just forty, so we remove the zero _and_ the minus from the equation and are left with\n\n>>40 + 2 + 2\n\n>>42 + 2\n\nWhich resolves to 44.\n\nTL;DR: Do the multiplication first, the rest after. Don't get confused by the minus, it's not part of the 10 (or the 0), it simply means that the next number to the right of it is going to be subtracted from the number left of the minus.

On the other hand, If that alien society had a rule where ```a + b \u2260 b + a```,  math would be broken. \n\nA beautiful property of math is its universality. We may not know anything about how aliens communicate with each other, but we know that their addition is commutative, just like our addition.",

Deviating from inline exponent notation helps a lot there, but I suppose that's fair considering that we were only really discussing inline multiplication/addition notation.   \n\n\nI feel much of the clarity comes from the familiarity which I would imagine we've both developed for polynomial notation, and its predictable sequence of operations. Ultimately, I think you are correct that in many contexts parentheses make things unreasonably cluttered, without providing clarity.

To go back to the original equation:  \n\n\n 10+20-10\\*0+2+2  \n 10+20-(10\\*0)+2+2  \n\n\nI would say that provides clarity, without making it very cluttered.

The only major difference is that multiplication is usually written as implicit multiplication against a variable or paranthetical term instead of with a times sign, and I think the order of operations when you see that form of expression is more intuitive to people even though it's literally the same thing as PEMDAS.\n\nIf your only point is that this *exact problem* could be made less ambiguous by adding a set of parentheses so that nobody had to think about PEMDAS, then no duh.

There are *contexts* where order of operations doesn't apply. But, outside of those contexts, order of operations is pretty much always assumed, in much the same way that when reading English you assume the letters and words go left to right. If you assume order of operations, *as you should*, then the expression unambiguously equals 44.",

      "text": "God I hate the acronym PEMDAS. I don't even like using an acronym at all, but gun to my head I'd pick PEMA: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Addition. And then you must also understand that subtraction is equivalent to addition, because for example 20 - 10 is equivalent to 20 + (-10). Similarly, 20 \u00f7 2 is equivalent to 20 \u00d7 1/2, and square root of 100 is the same as 100 to the 1/2 power. I'm not saying you need to write out all of these conversions, just understand that you can, and that's why they're equivalent. \n\nSo, why?\n\n1) PEMDAS is broken. BODMAS is broken. Number one piece of evidence is the amount of confusion out there about this. Track record. \n\n2) Why is it misleading? PEMDAS implies Multiplication BEFORE Division, Addition before Subtraction. Yes it does - the acronym structure implies \"do one letter after another\". That is THE cause of the confusion. Why in God's name would you package something up with such a deadly and LIKELY misconception baked right in. It's like selling a knife with razor blades sticking out of the handle that will cut you if you hold it like ANY OTHER KNIFE. \"Oh, you just have to remember to hold it in this special way...\" THEN YOUR DESIGN IS FLAWED. \"Here, inexperienced survivalist, survive on your ocean journey, all you need is this canteen!\" \"They're inexperienced, don't you think they'll try to drink the ocean water?\" \"Naahhhhh, why would anyone think to do that?\" \n\n3) If you need to say \"PEMDAS, oh yeah plus these other additional rules\", then your acronym isn't doing the job. \n\n4) PEMA can be criticized similarly, but the additional info you need there is mathematically sound, therefore more likely to stick because you have a REASON to remember it, vs just rote memorization. !\n\n5) \"Oh, but what if somebody hasn't learned that 20 - 10 is the same as 20 + (-10)?\" Then why in the fucking fuckety fuck are you touching Order of Operations? Enforce prerequisites!!! Would you teach multiplication before addition? Exponents before multiplication??? \"Hey kids, let's do calculus now. Oh you haven't taken Algebra yet? Don't worry, here's a handful of stupid, broken, incomplete, misleading acronyms to replace that body of knowledge. They dont mean anything to you and you have no foundation to anchor them to and to fall back on. And away we go!\"\n\n6) In PEMDAS, where the fuck are roots???? At the very least, shouldn't it be PERMDAS? P/ER/MD/AS. At least then it'd be only misleading, vs misleading and incomplete.\n\n7) \"Teaching to\" an acronym or shortcut is such a fundamentally flawed approach. Understand the PRINCIPLE, tie things back to WHAT YOU ALREADY KNOW, build one layer upon the next. Then, THEN! Now that you will understand the exceptions and nuance needed, NOW if you'd like to use an acronym to bundle together that understanding, then you may do so. Don't lean on something until you know it's sturdy.\n\nSeriously, fuck PEMDAS. Forever. IMO it's one of the biggest catastrophic bungles in the entire universe of  of math education. Nothing is as emblematic of why so many people struggle with math. It's almost as bad as FOIL. Gotta run for now but I'll try to come back later to comment on why FOIL is also trash.",

So now you have: (20) + (20) + (0) + (2) + (2) = 44\n\nNow I'm not saying you have to do it explicitly like that, just that that is what is implied when you add/subtract terms. So when you saw one term minus another term, i.e. 20 - 10 * 0, that subtraction implies a -1 that only implies to the next term, not all terms after it.",

But when dealing with numbers you want to get the chunks out of the way first. \n\n(17+1)+10^3 -6+900x1/3. \nWell that\u2019s just a chunk of 1000, a chunk of 300, and some stragglers that make 12. Another way to look at it, in algebra we were taught that all mathematics derived from simple arithmetic, and higher order functions are just shortcuts that show how much arithmetic you are doing at one time. Everything else that follows is what I\u2019ve\u2026 realized, is the only word for it.\n\nThat means those high order functions are their own expressions, for a *specific* number. It\u2019s just that the number is shown as an instruction. Like how a variable *x* represents a completely unknown number. But in the case of an expression, even though you may not know what the number is, you know exactly what makes it. So in that example, the parenthetical is obviously a single expression; it\u2019s its own little self-contained box\u2014 it\u2019s just that we can already see what\u2019s inside the box. 10^3 is *a* number that is three 10s multiplied together. 900/3 is *a* number. Etc. And that\u2019s the reason for orders of operations. You have the keep the numbers separate, and we separate them by the number of \u201csteps\u201d of arithmetic that each \u201cnumber\u201d contains, so that we don\u2019t miscalculate by some order of magnitude. \n\nSo yeah. It\u2019s a bit like finding an address, to reiterate. First you find the right State, then the right city, then the right street, then the block, then the house number.\n\nI think I got carried away. I think I should have been a math teacher\u2026",

And that might have started a cascade of errors, because it seems that you then applied the subtraction to everything after it.\n\nIt would really read like this: \n\n(20 + 20) - (10 x 0) + (2 + 2) => 40 - 0 + 4 => 40 + 4 = 44\n\nI think the thing that you are missing is that subtraction includes an implied multiplication by -1. But that only applies to the term being subtracted, not every term after that.\n\nBasically you broke distribution rules and distributed the -1 across all the terms after it when it would really only distribute across the next term.\n\nDoes that make sense?",

I'm guessing you distrubuted the implied multiplication of -1 for the 10x0 term to the two \"2\" terms after it, giving you -4 and therefore 40-4=36.\n\nThe - sign only applies to the next term. If it helps, the explicit order of operations of problem is:\n\n(20) + (20) + (-1 * 10 * 0) + (2) + (2)\n\nBasically, multiplication happens first, before any subtraction or addition (subtraction has an implied multiplication by -1...). So the - 10 x 0 is actually a + (-1 * 10 * 0) which gets you \"adding\" a \"negative 0\" which does nothing to change the sum of terms.",

I believe when you say adding a negative zero, in the operation itself you would subtract a positive zero, which also does nothing, but there is no longer a subtraction... basically the problem ended up looking like (20 + 20) - ((10 X 0) + 2 + 2) to me, so...that's what happened for me.

                  "text": "> basically the problem ended up looking like (20 + 20) - ((10 X 0) + 2 + 2) to me, so...that's what happened for me.\n\nOkay, but that is what I was saying about distrubuting the -1 across everything after it. So you took that and thought that you were subtracting (0 + 2 + 2) from 40 to get 36... That is why I said you applied the subtraction to everything after it. Does that make sense? When I said you got the -4, I meant for everything after the subtraction operation, so you got 40 - 4 (or 40 + -4).\n\n>  so I only did each operation in the sequence of pemdas, rather than the sequence of the pairs of numbers as well.\n\nI guess that kind of makes sense and is something of a weak spot for PEDMAS. That is why I brought up subtraction implied a multiplication, to show that you have to do that before any addition.\n\n> I believe when you say adding a negative zero, in the operation itself you would subtract a positive zero, which also does nothing, but there is no longer a subtraction...\n\nWell, yes, maybe me bringing that up is confusing. My point is that subtraction is addition of a negative number. And 0 can be neither positive or negative, or even if it could it would still be 0 and always \"do nothing\" in addition or subtraction.\n\n> Never heard of the implied multiplication by negative 1, though.\n\nWell, that is how you get a negative number. And subtraction is just addition of a negative number. The part that something like PEDMAS kind of leaves out is that you reduce terms first. Terms are things separated by additions or subtractions. So you reduce those first and then each term is independent because you are at the \"end\" of PEDMAS and all you have left is adding or subtracting and that combines combinable terms (which is everything here because there are no variables to \"keep\" multiplications from being reduced). The order of addition and subtraction doesn't really matter (unlike multiplication and division). PEDMAS just does it that way to be decisive and because doing addition first is generally a little easier.\n\nAnyway, I'm not trying to be hard on you, just trying to clarify. But maybe more help than you were asking for, haha.",

As I said, I'm well aware of order of operation etc.\n\n\nWhat I'm saying here, is why write it out in such a way as to leave any area for confusion. \n\n\nIm not saying that both answers are correct, they clearly are not. I'm saying that if you are using mathematics, and it's important that the question be understood CORRECTLY, then why not put in the brackets?\n\n\nUnless the whole idea is to shame people for not knowing that which they were not taught.

In this example, sure you\u2019re supposed to multiply first but the structure of the problem is clunky- is it (20+ 20 - 10) x (0 + 2 + 2)? Or (20 + 20) - 10 x (0+2+2)? It\u2019s meant to be confusing and is not good math. (But either way you slice it the answer ain\u2019t 4)",

No shit nobody in higher math uses multiplication symbols and this is written in a way that no equation would ever be written except in lower grades of school. But that doesn't change that there's literally only one interpretation and you assuming some other crap is still just incorrect.\n\nThere is only one valid interpretation for the equation, if writing it as 20 + 20 - 10(0) + 2 + 2 would make you feel better go ahead but that's still the only way to do it.",
