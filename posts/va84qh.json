  "text": "TIFU by coming home early to surprise my wife, who was having a surprise birthday party for me\nIm still chuckling at this even though it\u2019s kinda fucked up. Long story short, I forgot my own birthday. \n\nYeah yeah I know it\u2019s weird, had a little bit of a ruff childhood and my birthday was either never celebrated or forgotten well\u2026.both. So as I grew older I forgot about it myself, I mean we never did anything and what not so who cared. \n\nNow I\u2019m married with a wonderful women who\u2019s very thoughtful *but* she always does some kind of party or date on my birthday. But sometimes I still forget, so today I came home early from work to surprise my wife\u2026.who was surprising me. \n\nI walked in quietly, and I saw her in the kitchen, with flour and cake mix on her forehead and tapestries, birthday cups flowers and gifts around the table. She was making a cake, for a surprise party. *my* surprise birthday. \n\nMy mouth dropped and I quietly walked backwards to the door, exiting quietly and waiting till 7:30 to come back home. My wife would be so sad and she was workin so hard\ud83d\ude05.\n\nSo within to time frame of about 3 and a half hours, I practiced my \u201coh my god I\u2019m so suprised face\u201d \n\nWhen I came home she yelled \u201csurprise!!\u201d And I did a very crappy surprise face hugged her and we had a movie marathon. \n\nThis secret will never come out. But I think this was the best birthday ever. I find this kinda funny\ud83d\ude02. I will be taking this secret to my grave. \n\nTL;DR i forgot my own birthday, came home from work early to surprise my wife and my wife was making a cake, for *my* surprise birthday. Whoops!",

The phrase in fact comes from sailing, and was originally *only the necessary definition*:\n\n>Cut and run or cut-and-run is an idiomatic verb phrase meaning to \"make off promptly\" or to \"hurry off\". The phrase was in use by the 1700s to describe an act allowing a ship to make sail quickly in an urgent situation, by cutting free an anchor.\n\nFrom Wikipedia. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut_and_run\n\nThough it does also note its pejorative use, specifically in politics though, in reference to withdrawal from war.",

Whenever they're in a dangerous situation and have to leave.\n\n>\"Way to cut and run, bud! Good going!\"\n\nNo one uses that phrasing for *anything*, man. Have you never received praise before? How about this:\n\n>You did the only thing you could, man. You were brave. Not everyone has the courage to cut and run when they're in that deep.\n\nDon't even try and pretend this isn't possible.\n\n>Even if it wasn't meant to be, it just sounds sarcastic because no one uses it to mean something good.\n\nI'm not saying \"good\". It's not like it's a compliment. It's just a description of a desperate retreat. Killing isn't a good thing either, but you'd still be praised for doing it to rescue someone. Not everything's black and white.\n\n>I was making a legitimate point about victims of abuse having every right to be disdainful of marriage and this is what people seize on.\n\nUh, no, people are talking about other things, too.

No one is saying that every person who doesn't value marriage is a sad sack.  They saying that people who go online and try to convince everyone that marriage as a concept has absolutely no value are sad sacks.  It's one thing for a person to have a personal reason for not wanting to get married and another for that person to use their personal reason in a quest to convince the world that it's a horrible institution.  The latter are sad sacks, absolutely.",

It's still assuming single income families with multiple kids and traditional gender roles. Prenups are a way to fix that. \n\n\n>Thats why the value proposition of marriage is near zero today.\n\nThe value proposition of a marriage is the tax and legal benefits you get while it lasts. It also offers financial safety for a spouse who takes a hit to their career for child rearing purposes.     \nThat's it, and it doesn't need any more value. In fact, I'd be all in favor of making the child rearing stuff independent from actual marriage.\n\nIf you don't want/need those values, don't get married.",

They mentioned that it had been so long and asked how old I was now. We finished our conversation and got off the bus a few stops later, when my friend asked me why I lied about my age. I looked at him confused and he told me that I had said the wrong age. Turned out, I just didn\u2019t realize how old I really was and innocently said I was a year younger lol\n\nEdit: I\u2019m 45 now, but this was when I was 27",

So I don't care\n\nHe married a beautiful woman, but he's still throwing a birthday party. Sometimes I forget. This morning I went home and surprised my wife.\n\nI was silent and wanted to eat in the kitchen. Caramel dough Christmas cake I found in the kitchen with flowers and decorations. I make a cake for a good meal. My birthday is beautiful\n\nI opened the room and walked slowly to the door, walked out slowly and waited seven and a half hours to get home. My husband is angry and hard working.\n\nHe practices three hours. I miss you, God.\n\n\"Below!\" I cried. To my surprise, I ran a marathon.\n\nThere will be no secrets. But I think birthdays are better. Do something, I want to tell you the secret of the tomb.\n\nI don't remember my doctor's birthday, I ran home. I am proud of my husband. My wife makes cakes for my daughter. On me",
