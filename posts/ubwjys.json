In the grand scheme of things I get why he did it. You can object to something, but if the jury still hears it it will affect them even if you tell them to disregard it.\n\n>Also, just as an afterthought, wouldn\u2019t the statement made by the witness up until the lawyer objected NOT be considered hearsay as he was not saying anything that wasn\u2019t already known & could be adequately substantiated by the evidence which both parties had access to.

The doctor could be called to testify to that fact. This person is not the best witness to be asked. That would be hearsay. Unless an exception applies which I can't think of any.",

Now the difference is length, sure, but I'm not sure that making digs at lawyers and being overtly rude is going to look positive to a jury, that's all. From what I've seen in the filings, Depp probably has a good case no matter how he's cross examined, but the lawyer's job when cross-examining a plaintiff in a case where multiple aspects come down to he said/she said, is to make the guy look as unreliable as possible. He can do that while also making himself look like a dick.",

Roses are some of the most commonly grafted plants actually. Almost all of them are wild roses grown for the root base then a more delicate rose is grafted onto the top. \n\nSo, sometimes you plant a rose, it dies, then comes back except now you just have the wild rose.",

He was the house manager for a place they stayed in London and Depp and Heard asked him to help them out when they travelled to Australia to serve in the same capacity to organize housekeeping, arrange chefs, set up the house for them, whatever. He was technically paid by the production company involved with Pirates of The Caribbean 5. \n\nHe suggested that he saw Heard more often because Depp was busy filming most of the time. I don't think he's good friends with either of them, but because he is based in the UK he could not be forced to testify, he had to come by his own will so he must have had some interest in participating to defend Depp.",

But, he's probably responding to \"this doctor TOLD ME.\"\n\nHowever, I'm not versed well enough on the law to know if saying \"I heard X say Y\" isn't a valid witness statement, and, especially if they are medical professionals conversing about a patient. It depends on the venue.\n\nYou can enter into evidence that \"I read the report on the patient.\" Or \"I examined the patient.\" But not; \"I was told by the other doctor the patient was injured\"? \n\nSo, it's jarring to the doctor that he can't relay a medical expert's information. \n\nAgain, not a lawyer, but \"I heard him say\" is not the same thing to me as \"hearsay.\" You witnessed someone tell you, versus you formed an opinion based on hearing something.\n\nOtherwise, prisoners who hear other prisoners \"admit to a crime\" cannot be used against them. Which, seems sketchy to me to be honest, because the testimony can reduce a sentence, but, we do love to convict people in criminal court based on a preponderance of evidence, do we not? We catch a small drug dealer to get a bigger drug dealer. Is it not true that \"I heard them talking about murder\" is used all the time? It's likely very rare anyone but the perpetrator witnesses a murder.\n\nIf the witness says; \"I know he's the murderer\" but didn't witness it, that is I think, definitely hearsay.",

Possibly could tweak it to \u201cDid you do as he directed?\u201d but counsel would still object and you\u2019d have to give the explanation. Why would you need information about what the doctor said if the point of the questioning is to determine what the witness himself saw and did? Hearsay.

Maybe offer some (circumstantial) evidence for why they are not true. Meanwhile the judge / jury should discount the testimony, exactly because of the reasons you mention, but not discard it entirely.\n\nYou (and US law with you) are taking a weirdly absolutist stance on this. No evidence is 100% reliable or 100% unreliable. It should always be weighed, tested, prodded. Testimony is no different there. Hearsay testimony should obviously be discounted, but not dismissed.\n\n> In your example of someone\u2019s wife being the origin of the statement, again in principle they are under oath and must say the truth.\n\nIf people never lied under oath than trials would become very simple. \"Did you kill him?\" \"No\" \"Okay, you're free, have a nice day\".\n\nAgain, I'm not saying hearsay evidence should be taken as 100% reliable. It should be weighed like all other evidence. But it is relevant. If three witnesses say the wife said X, that should count for something in a trial. Obviously not enough to convict someone based on that alone, but nor should it be entirely ignored. Of course you could, and probably should, ask the wife directly. But that's another matter. And regardless of the wife's testimony, the additional 'hearsay' testimony still has value.",

          "text": "The legal definition of hearsay is \"an out of court statement given to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\" You can object to any witnesses' answer as hearsay, even if you asked the question that brought up the hearsay.\n\nHere, I believe he is looking to confirm that this witness has no direct knowledge of what caused the injury. The witness is telling him that the doctor told him \"he sustained an injury on one of his fingers,\" and then the lawyer objects in the middle of the answer. It's a bad objection because there's no dispute that Depp's finger was injured. It's not hearsay because no one is using this statement to prove that Depp's finger was injured.\n\nI believe the attorney expected the witness to say that the doctor told him how Depp was injured but got ahead of himself and objected before really realizing what exactly he said. Hence the admonition from the judge. A better way to handle it in my opinion would be to try take control of the witness again and force him to simply answer \"yes or no\" to the question of whether he had direct knowledge of how Depp's finger was injured.\n\nRegardless of whether it would have been \"correct\" to object to hearsay here, it certainly builds the impression in the jury that the attorney is grasping and doesn't know what he's trying to do. His own kind of bumbling reaction doesn't help. I haven't been paying close attention to the trial though so I can't say whether he's a clown or not, but this isn't a great look.",

And if the pedestrian isn't dead, the doctor would be the witness, no?\n\n> A direct witness would be important but then it's word (no) against word (yes) and both witnesses would be questioned and cross examined, credibility impeached and rehabilitated etc.\n\nSo the defense has a witness, also. But still, even If they would normally be equal, wouldn't plaintiff's witness has the advantage? Their version of the testimony would benefited more from the experts.\n\nI don't know how good a counselor have to be to explain away why there is pedestrian's blood on the front of the car near the place where there's also a dent, but I think it should be very difficult.\n\n> You're assuming a lot of things, which is why I asked!\n\nI just kinda list things that came to mind about car crashes, though.\n\n> Source: I am a lawyer.\n\nNone of what you brought up here requires any credentials, correct?",

Depp's is a civil one.  The difference is prison vs. fines/restitution.  When prison is on the line (aka criminal court), it's my understanding that the defense rarely wants to put the defendant on the stand for reasons mentioned above.  The defense is opening up the defendant to a possible grilling they may not be prepared for.  It's a big risk.\n\nIn a civil case, the stakes are lower, and in this case, it's really going to come down to who was discredited the least through personal testimonies and with the help of witnesses.\n\nIf I'm wrong or if there's more to it than this over-simplification (I'm sure there is), please elaborate as I would also be curious to learn more.",

If you say \"yes, I headbutted them\" then the jury thinks you were the one who went in for the attack, if you say \"no\" then the lawyer is going to ask how that can be the case if your forehead made contact with the other person's head\n\nYou'd need to be careful how you framed it though, and you wouldn't want to try it in a situation where it wasn't obvious the lawyer was trying to misconstrue things.

Neither the judge nor jury will believe a thing you say on the stand once you're caught in a lie. \n\nBe the person who says, \"Yes, I hit them with my car,\" and at the appropriate time, you'll get to finish with, \"They jumped in front of me...\"\n\nIIAL: I can't tell you how terrible it is to lie on the stand.

Huge success. Not implemented permanently there or anywhere else.\n\nPrimary issue/road block? The judges and admins themselves. Often, the claim is \"it will affect the behaviour of the people testifying!\".\n\nNo shit, Sherlock. That's the point, isn't it. Knowing that you'll actually feel the effects of the law that states it is punishable by up to 1 year in prison to intentionally lie or hold back information one has, in such a way that it causes a person to recieve a punishment they did not deserve, or a deserving person goes unpunished.\n\nMy personal experience is that the gender divide in family matters and custody cases is not so clear cut as 'mom has all the benefits of the doubt' - but 'we recognize a fellow bullying person and see a victim ripe for plucking and will join in!' regardless of gender.\n\nThere are a few good people out there, and I strongly suspect it has to do with a no bullshit, level headed leadership in the office space of each individual courthouse.\n\nI am a woman, my kids are with their proven (by video even) violent father. The court papers do not reflect what was actually said by multiple witnesses, discredit what has been cherry picked from my statements, and is also filled with lies added by the judge or specialists assessing the family situations during the work prior to the court date.\n\nWhat to do about it?\n\nThe press rarely writes about it. Norway is dropping further down the ranks for freedom of press year by year. Not because journalists face execution. But because the Norwegian go along to get along attitude sees the press simply avoiding the tougher, critical investigative journalism against the powers that be.\n\nWe have an article here or there.\n\nReality is that me and so many others have recordings and videos, even straight up paperwork done by these people themselves that expose the horrendous and catastrophic lies. What we do not have, is any type of instance with the actual power to decide that the departments below them must fire employees for their transgressions.\n\nOur chain if command for complaints are all built on trust and having a sense of shame. They can command the departments below them to reassess their stance, and explain themselves in writing.\n\nThat is all.\n\nThat is actually all.",

Judges are there specifically to enforce the rules of the courtroom and settle disputes between the opposing sides so that everyone is working on an equal footing. If the judge thinks it\u2019s a ridiculous question they might ask the lawyer to explain their reasoning or reframe the question in a less provocative manner, but they would have to be really beyond the pale for the judge to do that. Generally the lawyer asking the question would ask the judge to step in, and the judge would tell the witness to answer yes or no or be held in contempt of court which A) means they have to pay a fine or potentially face jail time for disobeying and B) would make them look like a terrible witness to the jury so their testimony will hold less weight. The vast majority of the time if it gets to that point that witness will back down and answer the question in a straight forward manner, and then the other side will come back to that point when they go back up at which point the witness can expand upon the point they were trying to make earlier. This helps to keep the case going rather than the lawyer and witness bickering back and forth and wasting everyone\u2019s time.",

If you just let the witness ramble on as long as they want they will take way more time than is necessary to get the relevant information across. When their own lawyer guides them to just the relevant information they will usually go along with it, but when those corrections come from the opposing side they will generally want to double down and keep talking about irrelevant things. Both lawyers know all of the evidence ahead of time, they know what arguments the other side will make and what counter arguments they\u2019ll need. It almost never happens where testimony on the stand reveals new information, so if a witness is trying to weasel around a question they are usually either A) obfuscating the truth or B) going into a level of detail their lawyer already decided is irrelevant. In both cases letting them talk as much as they want is either inefficient or actively harmful to the pursuit of the truth. If they just answer yes or no then their lawyer might decide not to circle back at all, and if they do they will try and get the witness to stick to the relevant details. Not only does that save time but it helps their testimony stay coherent so the jury can actually follow along and understand what they are saying instead of it just being a stream of conscious rant they said while panicking under pressure.",

The box you ticked will not stand up in court.

Amber Heard's lawyer played an audio clip of Johnny threatening to cut himself.  There was no context given to it, when it happened, nor was Johnny asked to explain.  It left the impression all weekend that Johnny was suicidal, and potentially violent.  On Re-direct yesterday Johnny explained that this was 2 months after Amber made the accusations and filed for the restraining order, and begged to meet with him when he was in san Francisco on tour with his band.  When Johnny realized the meeting wasn't for her to come clean, he said he just gave up, and was telling her, ok, I will cut myself and give you my blood, it's the only thing left to give.  All it did was make her lawyer look like an ass for the Thursday stunt, and her like a psychopath trying to drive him crazy.",

That dislike is going to color all other interactions you have with her. You will perceive her jokes as less funny, you will perceive minor bad habits as major issues, any time she complains about something you'll think \"ugh, her again\", etc, etc. If a month later you learn that she actually had permission to take that food, then that isn't going to completely undo all the other negative opinions you've formed of her in the meantime.

Roman soldiers were encouraged to have sex with each other to create a bond to fight for those you care about and not \u201ccheat\u201d on their wives. Different culture and different ideas but I don\u2019t see it any different then or now. Can label it any way you want but it\u2019s really up to the persons attraction not just sexual urges. You can love women but have sex with men and still be \u201cstraight\u201d or \u201cbi\u201d or whatever. The love part is where I see a difference, but understand if others don\u2019t.",

Once those feelings were *completely* gone I suddenly stopped seeing any difference between romantic or sexual attraction - romantic attraction was blocked by my aversion towards \"being\" bi or gay. And I had a total misconception what that attraction could be - it turned out to be completely different than what I thought it was\n\nAnd I'm not sure that you roman soldier example illustrates your case. To care about someone there has to be an attraction to the person, not to dicks or butts as sexual organs attached to whatshisface. If they indeed had sex to be attracted to care for one another in a battle, they had both romantic and sexual attraction in place",

That in itself already reveals that you treat straight as normal and non-straight as not normal. So you stretch the normal to cover the \"non-normal\", which is doable in your case, while by implication reinforcing with your example that something fully \"non-normal\" is something that is to be avoided if possible despite having benevolent acceptance of them as humans. Like, traditionally we viewed married Romans as \"normal\", so we are traditionally \"normal\" if we behave like them, which implies the existence of traditionally abnormal people who aren't like Romans with their wives\n\nImagine saying the same about some other thing. Something like, \"I'm NOT an American! I'm just a person who happened to be born in US and I live here currently! But I'm fine with Americans, they are great people too\" That in itself implies some negative assumption about the \"other\", the one the person is not. It requires having a feeling that there's something about Americans that makes you want to separate yourself from them, despite then accepting them as someone that is foreign to you. And returning to the sexual orientation, this is reinforced by traditional treatment of anything homosexual as abnormal, thus anything bisexual was renamed into \"just playing\" or \"having fun\", etc. Essentially minimizing it and pushing it down so that it could fit into the \"normal\" view of people, separating themselves from the \"abnormal\" ones who couldn't push it down and were too different\n\nThere's a lot of completely unwarranted biphobia both in straight circles and (sadly) LGBTQ ones, but there can also be a kind of grain of truth to that. And I think this \"I'm straight, I just have sexual desires towards men\" is one of the things that can rightfully piss people off due to all the baggage and implications, even if consciously your heart is in the right place",

To add you are also adding labels in your own descriptions to counter my labels. So I think we mean the same thing spoken from a differing narrative because there aren\u2019t words for \u201cno words\u201d or \u201cno labels\u201d. Examples have to be rooted in something to be explained. I just think if you boil it down loving someone doesn\u2019t mean x, it means whatever it means to yourself and no one should be able to label that for you or take it away from you what ever they or you wish to call it. It means what you feel and an emotion uniquely yours, when it comes down to it how do you label a unique emotion or feeling? You really can\u2019t, it\u2019s specific to the experience and person. If there weren\u2019t any words for any of it yet, what would you call it? Love? Lust? Hate? Idk but it would be put in some sort of box and those mean generic things, that\u2019s what my true meaning is. It doesn\u2019t matter. Love (as an already set in box) doesn\u2019t need a modifier.",

A proper objection would be \"unresponsive\" as in the witness is not answering the question asked.  \n\nThe question was whether the *witness* knew what caused the injury to Depp's hand, essentially asking the first hand knowledge of the witness.  But the witness had no first hand knowledge and therefore started giving secondary knowledge \"someone else told me\".  This could be considered \"hearsay\" since it's an out of court statement if made to prove the truth of the matter asserted, i.e., that was the cause in fact of the injury.  But it's not being made for that purpose.\n\nIf the lawyer objected \"unresponsive\" and the judge agreed, the lawyer could ask the judge to direct the witness to answer the specific question.  Alternatively, the lawyer could simplified/narrow the scope of his question so that the only possible response could be \"yes\" or \"no\".  \n\nFor example, \"did you yourself examine Mr. Depp to determine the cause of the injury to his hand?\".  \n\nIf the witness still refuses to answer \"yes\" or \"no\" to those questions, again ask the judge to admonish the witness into answering the question.  If they still refuse, it depends on how far you want to push it.  If it's important enough you can ask for the witness to be held in contempt of court.  But if it's not important, you've already made your point, which is discrediting the witness before the jury by making it seem like they have something to hide.",

Something so obvious would be objected to, but something more subtle could slip through.\n\nOutside of that, \"Did you hit the plaintiff with your car?\" \"Because she jumped in front of it, yes.\". The lawyer might try and tell you to stick to yes or no, but they're just trying to pressure you, they're not enforcing some right, and really, I wish judges would shut that sort of thing down.",

Although, they might strike it later. \n\nAt best, the witness is going to be allowed to provide their explanation, and then the lawyer can attempt to ask for a yes or a no answer, or at least establish that the witness can't or won't provide one.  It is up to the lawyer to point this out later and it is up to the jury to decide how this effects the witness's credibility.\n\nControlling a witness without seeming like a crazy asshole is not easy.\nBeing a good witness without seeming like a liar is also not easy.",

He also is fishing very heavily and obviously for those incriminating or damning statements that can be used as the \"You said earlier you did X\" or \"You stated before that you did not directly see Y\" to discredit the witnesses or defendant. He spent about 5 or 10 minutes asking the witness in this clip, over and over, about the number of photos he had and who he sent them to.\n\nLike I said I don't know if this makes him a clown in the legal system, but it definitely does to everyone watching this go down.",

It's like every public speaking nightmare turned to 11, but in real life.\n\nI transcribed a court case recently where the judge got so miffed with a barrister he had the clerk put him on mute (it was online court) so he wouldn't interrupt him chastising him. Judge basically said to him his argument was a failure and he wasn't gonna win with this case, and barrister had to spend the remaining hours very transparently trying to scrabble together some other strategy, all while cross-examining witnesses.  I could practically smell the stress sweat through the audio. :S",

Almost all clowns wear vibrant, over-the-top makeup, this is one of the many things that separates our style from that of mimes, who prefer monotones, or mummers, who typically focus a lot more on the costume while keeping the makeup subtle.\n\nAlso, while there are many types of clowns and we perform at many different venues, we don't normally question witnesses in court, preferring instead to spend our time on circus skills like unicycle, juggling, plate spinning, Balloon animals, etc. \n\nThe lack of costume, makeup, performance, and slapstick comedy says to me this guy is decidedly NOT a clown. While I did find him funny, I think he is more akin to a stand-up comic, albeit an accidental one.",

It's a symptom of ineffective cross-examination. I've watched only a bit of cross from Heard's attorneys and what I've watched hasn't been good. A good cross is short, single issue statements that the witness can agree with or say \"yes\" to. This makes the witness tell your story and not get off script as often. By contrast I've seen a lot of open-ended, multi-point questions that lead to issues like long responses or responses that you don't want (like hearsay).\n\n2. There are easy ways to clean this up without objecting to your own question and giving yourself a clownish look. He's objecting to hearsay because the person doesn't have personal knowledge of the information. Instead of objecting he could rope the victim back in:\n\n\"That's what you were told?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"But you weren't there.\"\n\n\"Right.\"\n\n\"You didn't see it.\"\n\n\"I didn't.\"\n\n\"You're only repeating what you were told.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"By someone who isn't testifying right now.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nThen resume your cross. \n\nThis video is technically correct lawyering but it's piss poor advocacy",

Not commenting on his general performance, as I've not paid much attention, but if he didn't anticipate the objection and was trying to fix the question, that makes a little more sense why the question was so awkward in the first place. Some of the best advice I ever received regarding trying cases was to try to anticipate an objection to literally every prepared question.

One is a statement he witnessed someone say something, not that he witnessed something personally but it was based on what he heard.\n\nThe witness is a medical doctor, being given medical information from another doctor.

It would be hearsay if it was offered to prove whatever the doctor prior asserted (which I think was that Depp was injured by such and such). \n\nThere are other exceptions even if it is hearsay you can use to get them in, but iirc they're all not common events (excited utterances, failure to deny, etc.) You can look them up in any evidence code state statutes or federal law (they're mostly the same).",

However, the Jury was feeling a lot of anger at that moment about the corruption of the \"justice system\" that had mean cops who can and do lie on the stand, crappy forensics work that presents itself as science but is often confirmation bias and a court system that funnels poor people into prison. \n\nNone if this specifically had a damn thing to do with a wealthy athlete turned actor,... but, the \"Dream Team\" managed to get the Jury to feel like they were making a statement to The Man. \n\nIn this particular case, we have a bunch of spurious rumors that weren't well founded, being hammered home to undermine Depp's credibility. It's technically correct, but, does it get to the truth? At some point, these are tactics in a sporting match to the layman, and, maybe those who play the sport have convinced themselves that it's right.",

My bigger gripe is with the people who proclaim that the lawyer (or any professional in a field they don\u2019t understand) is an idiot when they don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. I haven\u2019t watched enough of the case to assess the quality of this lawyer, and this clip is certainly not enough to make that sort of judgment. But people who don\u2019t know anything about the practice of law are quick to call him a clown or whatever. Again, I don\u2019t really give a shit about this individual case (which is really just a private dispute that doesn\u2019t have any real impact on the public), but you see the same dynamic with cases that really do matter and with other professionals doing their thing. I\u2019m not gonna stop you if you want to laugh at your doctor for doing doctor things, but it\u2019s a problem if you say the doctor is an idiot when it\u2019s really just you not understanding doctor things.",

That\u2019s why he ended the question with, \u201ccorrect?\u201d Doing that converts what is otherwise an assertion into a yes-or-no question and he was specifically going after a yes-or-no response. This is very very common when attorneys are eliciting testimony- they phrase these things as questions, but they are mostly trying to make points through their question asking. This technique is used in depositions too.\n\nHe\u2019s not just trying to ask the question, he\u2019s trying to make a point with his question and phrasing it how you suggest does not play into the strategy as well. Even if there\u2019s no hearsay issues, often the examining attorney will interrupt the witness and say something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s a yes or no question, sir.\u201d Because really and genuinely, they just wanted a yes or no.\n\nI understand that\u2019s not how normal conversations work, but that *is* how virtually all attorneys perform examinations. Often witnesses are prepped for this, but its understandable one would slip into an explanation in this circumstance where none was asked because it admittedly an unnatural way to force yourself to respond.\n\nAll of that is to say the attorney here phrased it how I think most attorneys would in that situation. He was just unfortunate in how the witness responded.",

There's much, much more cynical people than me here and they're reading at minimum slimeball off of him, so it really doesn't help that they also have a bias.\n\nLike 95% of being a trial lawyer is just being the most likable jester and he's not cut out for that. The judge may appreciate his studious dotting of Is and crossing of Ts, but the laymen of the world just see a huge schmuck.\n\nedit: I'll give you the perfect example of this. The other day Depp was on the stand and the crap lawyer was doing his routine, so as Depp answered he'd pause to wait for objections. He has that lawyer's number and isn't going to intimidated by that tactic. It may work sometimes. Hell it may work a lot. But it's really not impressing anyone who sees through it.

The record will reflect only those comments made that are not hearsay and will be the things the jury can review (unless the judge does not permit them to do so).\n\nThe lawyer isn't doing it to intimidate the witness, he's doing it to show the witness is unreliable. If you can't go three seconds without answering an objective question with something someone else said, then you're not a reliable witness. If you are on that jury, at the end of the day the question you are going to have to ask yourself about Depp is whether he is reliable. Throughout this trial he has been evasive, his answers have been dismissive, he has been rude and his stories have frequently started with things other people have told him. \n\nLike you said, the lawyer comes across as smarmy, and so we get funny clips, but I guarantee you that to a jury, the schtick gets old really fast, and they start to understand very quickly where the lawyer is going. Whether the jury will believe Depp will be based on his actual testimony, not a lawyer's attitude.\n\n> Like 95% of being a trial lawyer is just being the most likable jester and he's not cut out for that. The judge may appreciate his studious dotting of Is and crossing of Ts, but the laymen of the world just see a huge schmuck.\n\nThis is wildly untrue. You are not on that jury, and the vast majority of trial lawyers I know are quick-witted, but their job is not to be likable, and tons of them are not. You are watching a televised trial and assuming you know what's right and wrong based on how a guy makes you feel in edited clips. It's a good thing laymen don't instruct juries.",

So a party's statement is obviously not hearsay. \n\nAnd even if it wasn't Johnny Depp, it certainly could have been a statement reasonably pertinent to diagnosis and treatment, making it a pretty well established exception to hearsay, if Virginia has adopted such an exception. \n\nGranted the clips circulating about this lawyer do make him seem hearsay-happy, but still. It's silly to elicit an answer *from the doctor* and then jump straight to hearsay.\n\nEdit: OK, I re-watched and heard the response more clearly. I'll stand by the response being a hearsay exception - it may be that the witness knew what could have caused the injury based on what Dr. Gibbard told him. A doctor describing a wound to another doctor so they can determine how to handle it is pretty pertinent to diagnosis and treatment. And, checking Virginia's rules of evidence, it specifically allows hearsay that speaks to \"the inception or the general character of the cause or external source [of past or present symptoms, pain, or sensations],\" so this witness can testify as to what another doctor told him about the cause of the injury.

When do doctors get to decide they don't really like you and would rather let you die than do their job?\n\n>But only the wealthy get representation that will get them off of committing actual crimes.\n\nThat's not an argument for the badness of lawyers, it's an argument for more people to have access to quality representation. Poor people do bad things too, and in greater quantities. Should a poor known rapist be fairly represented in court?\n\n>What matters to you is if you can prove in a court based on thousands of interconnecting and contradictory laws if the evidence of them unquestionably murdering someone is strong enough to convict them, and how much money you can make from it.\n\nWho decides what \"unquestionable evidence\" looks like? You? Should we, mere mortals of the world, send you emails every time a crime happens so you can deliver your foolproof enlightened judgement based on what I can only assume is divine inspiration? The entire point of the process is to establish what happened and who did it beyond any reasonable doubt. What else is there? Tarot readings?\n\n>I don't expect you to see how it's fucked up. Obviously you can't, because you're a lawyer. You'd be bad at your job if any of this mattered, to you. But it should.\n\nlmao",

Before the trial, you can't really take the stance that a person is guilty and therefore choose not to represent them. You can decide that the case is unwinnable because the evidence is mounded so high, but a lawyer can't and shouldn't assume the guilt of their clients. There are plenty of people who were assumed guilty by the public but then came out of the court with an innocent verdict. Having lawyers to represent absolutely anybody without prejudice is a necessary part of a functional justice system unfortunately, otherwise it is based on how a case seems on the surface. \n\nThat's not to say that you're wrong. There are crooked lawyers, money informs justice, and American courtrooms are more about building a compelling narrative than presenting evidence. These are all problems that ideally wouldn't exist, but I wouldn't put all of the best lawyers in the same basket just because they will take any client. It's not for them to decide whether a person committed a crime. Only to advocate for them.",

I think that the reason he comes off looking foolish is a combination of some selective editing which places these objections in rapid succession, and the fact that the witnesses are very personable and sometimes make a show of the objection. \n\nThe clips of Depp responding to the objections are  a prime example of being legally correct but perhaps not tactically correct. Hard to tell if you don\u2019t watch every second of a trial. \n\nThe inverse is also true. There was a series of exchanges where Heard\u2019s counsel asked multiple times if Depp had signed a particular document. Depp\u2019s counsel could have simply objected to the question after the second time it was asked because it was previously \u201casked and answered.\u201d \n\nDepp\u2019s attorney chose not to in the instances I\u2019ve seen because Depp was actually pretty well prepped for the cross exam. When he answered in each instance he reminded the jury that he had already answered the question multiple times. His counsel didn\u2019t have to create an appearance that they were keeping him from being fully cross examined. In fact at one point, Heard\u2019s counsel gives up the game and said something to the effect of \u201cI\u2019m just trying to make the point that this is your signature.\u201d\n\nAll that said, it\u2019s hard to evaluate trial tactics in a vacuum. They have a cumulative effect; and really only the judge, court staff, and the jury get the full effect. When the trial is over, the only people who will be able to authoritatively say what \u201cwon\u201d the case for either side is the jury. We\u2019re all just on the sidelines playing armchair quarterback. \n\nSource: am an attorney, have won and lost trials.",

Here, we\u2019re discussing a theoretical of a doctor making statements to another doctor for\u2026.purposes of medical treatment.  Case law literally cannot get more clear: it does not matter who the statements come from as long as they are reliable and are in furtherance of medical diagnosis or treatment. This meets both the requirements of furtherance of a medical diagnosis/treatment and the reliability standard. And since case law clearly establishes it doesn\u2019t matter who made the statement (nor does it exclude doctors *anywhere*), it fits under the exception.\n\n>\tRight, not doctor to doctor.\n\nWhere is doctor to doctor excluded? Please, show me a single fucking thing that supports such a statement besides your opinion. Spoiler alert, it isn\u2019t, as long as it meets the rest of the test. \n\nThat\u2019s part of why the entire concept of secondary hearsay exists. Quick, go google that since they haven\u2019t taught it to you yet. Doctor statements are literally built upon the concept of secondary hearsay. Even the Prohaska case is about this issue (albeit, business records since it was a written report). One of the most common examples is statements made to a paramedic which are then made to a doctor. We run into secondary hearsay but case law is clear that this is not hearsay.\n\n>\twho has no ability to understand the difference between dicta and the actual holding.\n\nIs this for real right now? Did they just teach you what dicta means in school or something? Goal posts and your argument just keep on moving don\u2019t they. First you tried to differentiate based on the \u201cparty,\u201d now you\u2019re randomly excluding doctors despite the rule being clear as can be and crying that it\u2019s dicta.\n\nJesus you\u2019re fucking clueless.

I can\u2019t think of a situation when you would object to *your own question.* Instead you would just not ask it. Or ask it in a way that would likely result in a non-hearsay answer. Sometimes you want a hearsay answer and it is up to the opposing attorney to catch it and object. But this attorney asked a poorly worded question and didn\u2019t like the answer. There are other ways to handle the situation.\n\nMy take is that this guy is either EXTREMELY nervous (tbh if you\u2019re that nervous then you have no business being involved in a trial like this), unprepared, or he\u2019s just a rookie with no experience (although I would find it odd that a private firm would put a rookie in a speaking role in such a high profile trial. Perhaps Amber couldn\u2019t afford the partner\u2019s billable rate and she got the rookie associate instead).",

Its also a monumental achievement to get a job at this prestigious law firm, stay there and get promoted to a partner.\n\nAnybody with years of experience in any field would make them a decent expert. Then you have this guy who has years of experience of one of the best international lawfirms with one of the best education. There is absolutely no doubt he knows his shit.\n\nBut its common to see small mistakes even by experts during trial. This would be a minor mistake that happens quite often in your typical boring courtrooms where either most would just ignore it as its fairly common or some will just let out a quiet smile. Its just that this case is so widely publicised every small and big mistake will be broadcasted to the general public.\n\nI am absolutely a fan of Depp and I loath Heard, spending a lot of time calling her shit out on twitter but I dont think this guy is a clown that reddit makes it out to be.

If you don\u2019t catch it, your client is stuck with it. \n\nThis was a question about whether the witness knew what caused something while he was there on March 8, or whatever. He could have truthfully answered \u201cyes,\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d\n\nIt was a bad question though and could have been more precise. \u201cDo you have personal knowledge that X?\u201d would have been acceptable. If the witness doesn\u2019t know what \u201cpersonal knowledge\u201d is, it could be broken down further. \u201cDid you see Mr. Depo\u2019s finger get injured?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re you even present in the room when\u2026?\u201d Etc. \n\nThere are lots of methods we can learn to effectively cross-examine witnesses and it\u2019s hard to see where the lawyer is going. But, ideally, his cross would be tighter and he\u2019d have a few ways to control the witness. \n\nStill, trials and contested hearings are difficult. And these are civil lawyers who, in the United States, do not typically spend all that much time in trial. It\u2019s not surprising to me at all that this happened.

This being a civil trial, they aren't as serious or dramatic as a criminal court trial would be, and fictional courtroom drama is nearly outlandish in comparison to either.  Heard's male lawyer appears to be the main seat, but he doesn't seem real confident, and not a good actor; he can't use tone to emphasize points so he just keeps repeating himself. He is overusing hearsay objections, like out of a text book. It is actually a detriment to his own points, rather than needlessly object all of the time, he could use it in cross to damage credibility or perhaps weaken the  statements made.\n\nIn this specific instance, his face was painted, and wig firmly attached. I have seen it in many movies and shows, but it is a true cardinal sin. You never ask a question with out knowing how the witness will respond. You craft your question to ensure that you get the answer you want in the form that you want it. Mostly you don't script out everything, but you would want to rehearse your questions some, and it appeared they didn't do it well. He didn't get the answer in the format he wanted and panicked.\n\nNot a lawyer, but close... One thing that broke me was lack of acting ability. This guy struggles with that too. Imagine being weak in a fundamental job skill, and having to compete against a champion of that job skill. He is like a short armed boxer going in there against prime Tyson, and it shows. He has been making heavy use of hearsay objections in particular to slow down and break up responses to stay in control. This would be known as a theatric though, and I wonder how much longer he will be given leeway in using it. In all the trial footage and mock ones I have witnessed you generally only want to interrupt on vital information that could harm your case. Objecting every hearsay statement, leading witness, or offtrack questioning line tends to make your side look incompetent and will also give the opposing side incentive to do the same to you. It looks especially bad when it's your question in the first place.",

However, 1st hand hearsay is generally exempt, especially if not trying to claim a fact and you're just quoting.

                      "text": "Lawyer here. Relevance is a different issue. Any matter has to be relevant to be admissible. \n\nYou\u2019ve got to break down the hearsay rule: the witness cannot repeat a\n\n1 statement\n2 out of court\n3 to prove the truth of the matter asserted. \n\nSo, a gesture COULD be a statement if it conveys expressive meaning. E.g. \n\nProsecutor directing a cop: how did you identify the suspect?\nCop: the witness pointed at him.\n\nThe gesture of pointing is a statement. \n\nThe statement has to be out of court. So in the case of the witness pointing, it didn\u2019t happen before the court.\n\nUsed to prove the truth of the matter asserted is where it\u2019s hard to explain to non lawyers. \n\nSo in the example with the pointing witness, the cop is testifying that he identified the suspect because a witness told him that the suspect is a suspect. \n\nThe truth of the matter asserted is that the suspect was the suspect. The cop is using an out of court statement made by somebody else to PROVE that it was true. That\u2019s inadmissible hearsay.\n\nIn the black dress example, for some reason the question at hand is the color of the dress. The OP of the example can testify \u201cI saw my wife wearing a black dress.\u201d He cannot be the one to testify, as long as the truth of the matter asserted is that she was wearing a black dress, that his wife TOLD him that she was wearing a black dress. You can\u2019t use the out of court statement as PROOF that the black dress was being worn.\n\nIn the example in the other comment by the person who witnessed a sexual assault, the truth of the matter asserted is that the victim of the rape was in fact penetrated by the defendant\u2019s penis. The VICTIM could have testified if she wanted that she was penetrated: a statement she made to somebody else that she was penetrated can\u2019t be used as definitive proof that she was in fact penetrated. \n\nThe reason the hearsay rule exists is because each side has to have an opportunity to test the case and the credibility of the witnesses. You can\u2019t test the credibility of an out of court witness who isn\u2019t present; you can\u2019t cross them, you can\u2019t test their memory, you can\u2019t establish a reason they might lie. \n\nThere are circumstances where there are exceptions to the hearsay rule. Those are for the kinds of evidence that are assumed to be independently reliable because of the nature of the kinds of statements that they are. \n\nE.g.: \n\nProsecutor: how did you know to arrest Johnny Smith?\nCop: I heard a woman scream \u201chow could you shoot him, Johnny Smith?\u201d As I approached the scene of the altercation.\n\nIt\u2019s an out of court statement that is being be used to prove the truth of the matter asserted (ie that Johnny Smith was arrested for murder). But you don\u2019t need the screaming woman to testify to prove that Johnny did the murder because it\u2019s an \u201cexcited utterance\u201d and we assume that when a person makes a statement like that while being stressed out by the situation, they probably aren\u2019t lying about it. There are other ways to challenge the credibility of the evidence, but the assumption of the hearsay rule is that in general, people aren\u2019t pathological enough to make up a lie on the spot like that.",

His life's work has been to be cool in every situation, naturally. He is ten steps ahead of everyone in the room. The funny thing is that his acting ability is both a positive and a negative.

For one, the burden of proof is much lower (preponderance of evidence, which is basically \u201cmore likely than not\u201d or the proving with an over 50% degree of certainty that the defendant acted negligently). So a much lower standard than proof than criminal cases. If the defendant is decided to be liable for damages (in other words, they owe the plaintiff something for their unlawful actions), then they assess how much damages are owed. \n\nAdditionally, the state has an obligation to provide an attorney in a criminal case, but for a civil case it has no such obligation. In this case it doesn\u2019t matter, both parties are rich as sin, but it can actually suck if you aren\u2019t able to afford a lawyer in a civil case.",

For example, the witness mentions that s/he heard from someone who heard from someone that something happened. This kind of response is most likely hearsay and you can interrupt the witness to object while the witness is answering or object immediately after the witness finishes answering. Note: If there is a jury, you should try to object as quickly as possible so that the jury doesn\u2019t hear any objectionable testimony that they would have to try to forget.](https://www.womenslaw.org/laws/preparing-court-yourself/hearing/objecting-evidence#:~:text=To%20object%2C%20you%20have%20to,help%20getting%20the%20judge%27s%20attention.)\n\n\n\nFollow by an example they provide which just so happens to have the question asker objecting:\n\n\n>When a witness starts responding to a question with information that is completely unrelated to the question, you can object to it as being \u201cnon-responsive.\u201d This can be especially important in cross-examination when you are looking for very specific \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d answers.\n\n>>Example:\n\n>>You: \u201cIsn\u2019t it true that you put your hands around my neck after you pushed me on the ground?\u201d\n\n>>Other party: \u201cWell, yes I did.\u201d\n\n>>You: \u201cWhen I broke free, isn\u2019t that how you got the bruises on your arms?\u201d\n\n>>\u201cLook, I didn\u2019t mean to hurt you, I was just trying to get your attention \nand\u2026.\u201d\n\n>>You: \u201cObjection Your Honor, the answer is non-responsive.\u201d\n\n>>Judge: \u201cPlease answer the question sir.\u201d\n\n\nNow I know this isn't up to the usual standards of.... redditors who have commented in legal subreddits.. but I still think its quote reputable.\n\n[Top reply 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/facepalm/comments/ubwjys/amber_heards_lawyer_objecting_to_his_own_question/i673356/)\n\n[Top Reply 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/facepalm/comments/ubwjys/amber_heards_lawyer_objecting_to_his_own_question/i679sw5/)\n\n[Top Reply 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/facepalm/comments/ubwjys/amber_heards_lawyer_objecting_to_his_own_question/i66v2xr/)",

It's apparently not a complete blunder to object to your own question, though obviously he didn't handle this exchange with much dignity or confidence.\n\nThe longer the trial goes on the more I have to wonder if Heard set her lawyers up to fail by not being truthful (the makeup incident is a prime example) and that the reason they're getting their ass handed to them is that they really have absolutely nothing at all to work with. If she's lying to her lawyers, how much better could they do?\n\nThe internet is naturally having a lolfest. It's what the internet does. But it's a losing case. Heard was dropped by several lawyers on the way to this and the defence are really grasping.\n\nI do think Heard will insist she was not adequately represented if the outcome is not one she wants.

His inability (whether intentional or not) to spot figures of speech and exaggerations in text messages is worse than mine, and I'm autistic. \n\nLike no dude, him saying \"I'd break someone's nose if...\" when he's clearly pissed and possibly drunk/high doesn't mean he intends to do it. It's called a hyperbole and if you're older than 10 you should probably know that.",

He asked a question that did not require the witness testify as to hearsay, so when the witness began talking about a conversation he had, the hearsay objection is appropriate.\n\nAn objection in Court is an objection to the introduction of evidence. So a lawyer can object to another lawyer's question or the witness' answer, regardless of who asked the question originally.\n\nI've been in situations where I'm objecting to hearsay evidence every other question, and they're appropriate objections. I'd honestly be pretty annoyed if a bunch of internet strangers were watching my every move like this during trial in that situation, particularly if they liked the opposing party more than my client.\u201c",

What did you know and if you knew because doctor so and so told you, thats a different situation.\n\nHearsay.\n\n--edit, no one is arguing if what was said was actually hearsay or not, we arnt sure because the dude was cut off and we didnt get to hear the full sentence/statement (he could have gone on to give a full proper statement). What my comment was pointing out is what hearsay actually is and this might explain why the lawyer hearsay'd his own question, because he thought the dude was going to commit or was in the middle of it because he really seems like a bad lawyer and was not expecting the answer the dude was giving. A good lawyer already knows every answer to his own questions.\n\n>the report of another person's words by a witness, which is usually disallowed as evidence in a court of law.\n\"everything they had told him would have been ruled out as hearsay\"",

And yes, by then everyone was enjoying watching him battle himself.",

Because it simply doesn't make sense, because the doctor's statement is not being used as evidence for anything, as there's no dispute of Johnny Depp injuring his finger. He simply answers the question. That's why it's a bad hearsay, not because it's in his own question.",

There\u2019s zero reason to have it admitted into evidence but for its truth. Harmless, yes, but it\u2019s still hearsay, and you also risk the witness going onto some other hearsay statement that would be harmful, such as the witness repeating the doctor\u2019s conjecture of how it was injured (or repeating how Depp said it was injured).",

From what I can see, they are both abusive towards one another and each a complete mess. Just like a real toxic shit hole of a relationship. But in no way is he like completely innocent here. This is not like a gone girl type scenario. And I feel like it's being treated that way and he's being lionized online, when in fact it appears that both he and Amber were terrible and abusive towards one another and probably each committed a whole series of crimes. There's just a little too much blood lust in a way that makes me really uncomfortable. Neither of these people should be considered a hero or a victim. Or, they should both be considered victims. Of one another, and themselves. But in no way are either of these people good or worth celebrating or supporting.",

If from the very start the narrative had been that they are both assholes I don't think we'd be seeing this outpouring of support online for Depp.\n\nBut because it started with Amber being painted as the sole victim (and the additional manner in which she became a voice for abused women and was held up as a survivor), it's ended up being a kind of schadenfreude moment for anyone who didn't entirely buy that story but was criticized for not believing Amber. So now that they're getting evidence that she is indeed a piece of shit and should never have been held up in the manner she was, they're blindly ignoring the fact that Depp is pretty messed up himself and played a part in this whole mess.\n\nI can't say I don't empathize with that view, cause I damn well remember how vehement some of my friends in real life were when I initially took the stance of \"No clue what really happened with those two, we only have her accusations and that doesn't inherently mean that's the whole story\". Apparently that was incel adjacent thinking somehow. Now that it's apparent that Amber is a piece of shit too all those same friends are just washing their hands of the story as if they weren't gung ho in support of putting Depp down before. \n\nIt's very annoying to be quite honest. But it's whatever at the end of the day. I don't ultimately care about two celebrities and their personal lives. Just figured I'd explain why the internet/reddit might be so gung ho for Depp at the moment despite it not making that much sense.",

How the hell is that hearsay? It's just their own point of view of what they are recollecting. And if three, four, five others also say they heard the same thing being said, that would add up to being evidence because then there's more possibility that what's heard as having been said was actually true.\n\nIn any case, this guy is such a douchebag.

Do you think she would ever have wanted other people to see her bruises and cuts? This is what she used. She became very adept at it.\u201d\n\nThe point is: Milani Cosmetics released videos showing **that particular makeup was not released until 2017.**\n\nMilani Cosmetics even called the attorneys out on TikTok!\nNow, THAT\u2019S got to suck!!! \nAm I right?!\n\nFound it!!

He has issues sure, but from what I see he has been trying to get better to which I wish him nothing but the best.  I hope that if anything positive comes from this it is that men will no longer feel as afraid to speak up regarding issues of domestic abuse which we often are made to feel as though we are less of a man for putting up for it which often is a gradual process; it always starts perfect but then they gradually begin to wear the down.  Since things were well for awhile tou try to see if you can rekindle that spark but she has already decided to dedicate herself to ruining you so while you are dealing with this you also don't have many friends left. Being lonely can make you feel desperate for some kind of warmth, bringing you back to someone who you know is no good but you love them so you convince yourself that they are truly committed to being a better person because of your love.  As much as the fear takes a hold of your mind you can't help but think about the wonderful times you once had, hoping that perhaps that spark can be rekindled and they are serious about trying to be better and maybe they are for a brief period of time...then it begins once more..\n\nThe poor man needs a break so I hope he has an opportunity to take an extended in home vacation spending it with his kids and people he cared about once this is all over.  I want to hug him, I feel like he could use lots of them right now.",
