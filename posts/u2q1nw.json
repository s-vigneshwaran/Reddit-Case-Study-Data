In so many words, it argues that discipline is a meme, and that wanting things hard enough is insufficient. It argues that you need to approach change at the deeper level of personal identity, set goals based on that identity, and then optimize the process for reaching those goals. \"Being a marathon runner is part of who I am. How would a marathon runner start their morning?\" You set up cues and rewards and willingly pavlov yourself. It's all about harnessing desire to be productive towards an end, rather than discipline, which is easily exhausted. The author argues - I think rightfully - that this is the approach of most naturally \"disciplined\" people. It's not rejection of temptation that enables them to do tough stuff, it's the gratification of the reward. \"Discipline\" doesn't really factor into it.\n\nIt didn't cure my depression, but I was able to at least make some positive changes because of it.",

And doing them and having a positive result would, you'd expect, eventually make it easier to push past that. But depression isn't rational, that's the whole problem. No matter how long I've managed to keep going and functioning on a basic level, it never got easier. Instead it became much harder to avoid the thought of taking a break. Then you see, hey, your life didn't end because you didn't take out the trash. It didn't end because you didn't go to work one day. And so giving in the next time is easier. And soon you are back at square one, and still utterly exhausted.",

You theoretically could, because it's an egalitarian measure for the purpose of leveling the social playing field, and providing rights that were formerly exclusive to child bearing couples. I don't know if that would be a *good* argument, but it could be made.\n\nWhether \"cultural Marxism\" exists is a separate discussion.",
