Nor do I worship anything in any literal sense. I just don't believe it. Therefore, not a religion. Satanism is just trolling basically, in the best way possible I might add. But I agree with you, their beliefs don't deserve better treatment nor should it be prioritized over non belief. Society is slowly working towards that though, at least in the U.S. Other countries have already figured this out and guess what, they're mostly atheist and also some of the happiest countries in the world. Correlation isn't causation but I have a feeling it isn't just coincidence.",

Because right now the situation is that companies hire people for less than what it takes to exist and the public ends up footing the bill.  Often these companies get subsidies, too, so not only do we make up the difference in the pay they don't give, but we actually subsidize many of them on top of that.  \n\nWe could also always just tax the hiring companies what it costs to subsidize the employees it isn't paying well enough to exist.",

They are already tax-free organizations, why should they then receive additional money just so they can proselytize better?  If they want to open schools, fine, I'm good with that - if they want to teach religion at these schools, they should not receive public funding.

Meaning they cannot make a law that denies a school based on it being religious or favoring public schools when it comes to funding. Public funds for school children can essentially follow the child.\n\nIt is interesting on that note however, because Texas already had this in place. You could decide to send your child to Public School, or a Private Charter School. Wherever you sent them, the money allocated for that child went. Surprisingly the Charter schools (which often are nicer, have better technology, and far out perform public schools in our area) seem to make better use of the money. They are also filled with religion at the same time.\n\nSimply put, you cannot single out a school for being religious, as that violates the Constitution. School funds for a specific child can follow that child to whatever school the parents deem best. This is a win for parents because public schools are failing our children left and right.",

I had to write my own course despite being told I would be supplied a curriculum) to the school.  Both companies were owned by the same couple.\n\nThe result was to funnel all those tax dollars from the school to the other company.\n\nClasses were too large; tech was dodgy; and again I had to write my own classes (which I don't mind doing if you're upfront about it) while being told I would be supplied material.\n\nThat charter is a disaster.\n\nThe year I left, the head of school disappeared, the academic director disappeared, the dean of students disappeared.

I'd say that non-theistic Satanists, especially Church of Satan and The Satanic Temple outnumber them so vastly that I can't even begin to give a ratio. \n\nDon't throw around \"human sacrifice\" at Satanists. The Bible contains human sacrifice, ordered and done by Yahweh's chosen people. And one has but to enter a cursory google search to see just how many people, especially children, are killed in Christian exorcisms. Do you care to answer for each and every one of those? Then don't expect a Satanist to take responsibility for the usually spurious claims of Satanic human sacrifice. \n\nCharles Manson is irrelevant to this discussion, and it's absurd that you'd even attempt to thrown that down as a serious point.",

Those seeking to open non-Christian schools just have to show they can provide that curriculum standard is followed, while keeping a sharp eye on those established Christian schools. They don't keep up, the other schools report them for the violations and run them out of business. When the objections come from the Christian crowd, you push back with \"we're just being business competitive, got not a thing to do with religion\".",

There is a reason that the Black Panthers started open carrying in California and it scared people so much that Reagan signed the Mulford Act. The oppressors didn't care until there was a reasonable threat against them\n\nMoreover, calling Malcolm X a racist is incredibly narrow in understanding and ignores the growth he had throughout his life and how his views continued to grow and evolve until he was assassinated.\n\nPeople may not want violence, but as MLK pointed out, \"riots are the voice of the unheard\". At some point, when the boot is on one's neck and peaceful protests don't work, non-peaceful tactics are the remaining options.\n\nIt's why it is said there are four boxes of liberty:\n\n* Soap\n* Ballot\n* Jury\n* Cartridge\n\nTo be used in that order. \n\nThinking that peaceful protests and asking nicely without the undercurrent of a worse option for the oppressors is incredibly naive.",

All I know is that people must be free to practice whatever religion they want, but that is not the same as separation of church and state. \n\nMy understanding is that separation of church and state is a mantra that many politicians in the USA have historically tried to follow, but it is not anything written in stone nor must it be followed.\n\nIf I'm right, then the distinction I'm making is important since it means these justices are not obligated in any way to separate church and state. That's a scary thing, but it also seems to be a *true thing* to me.",

It largely comes from a letter written by Thomas Jefferson to a Baptist church containing his personal interpretation of the first amendment. (https://billofrightsinstitute.org/primary-sources/danburybaptists) The common misconception is that that religion should not play a role, even a tiny one, in government. The reality is that the government can intertwine with religion so long as it does not favor a specific religion or religion over others. (so say if someone wants to build a ten commandments monument on government property, any other religion should have equal opportunity to erect their own monument)\n\nPeople seme to think that elected officials making decisions based off of religious beliefs is somehow illegal or immoral. It's not, or at least it's not any more immoral than a politician voting solely based on party beliefs, which most do. These officials simply reflect the values of their voters. It's just the fundamental idea behind democracy. If you don't want relogious politicians, then a majority of people need to not be religious. If a majority of people value religion, expect religiously motivated decisions.\n\nI largely agree with Jefferson's sentiment here. I live in Utah, which is a borderline theocracy, but it is a constitutionally legitimate one. It's more a flaw of an imperfect system than anything.",

Instead of doing that they could instead simply decide to build more public schools and provide no funding to private schools, but they chose to do some really weird shit with public funds going to only _some_ private schools.",

I wanted them to be successful there.  I found that they were consistently a year behind their private school peers, *and there was no way to remedy this within the public school system*.\n\nJust recently, CA passed a curriculum change that forbade teaching Algebra prior to High School.  They have since backed off and said that it can still be decided by local school districts, but of course they aren't going to encourage schools to do so.  As a result, one of my kids took pre-Algebra two years in a row.  If you want to compete for spots in good engineering schools - I'm not talking MIT or Caltech, just upper quarter schools - you are expected to have 2nd year Calculus in HS.  You can't get there in public schools without taking summer classes.\n\nMy second anecdote was while I was evaluating \"school of choice\" in our district.  At a Q&A for one school, the principal was asked about the GATE (Gifted and Talented Education) classes offered at that school.  The Principal said flat out that there were little to no differences between GATE and standard classes.  This is because the range of students who meet the GATE standard is so broad, and they have to accommodate the least common denominator.\n\nIt is a disgrace that this state has a massive budget surplus, yet consistently under funds schools.  The public school system needs to meet students where they are and help them excel whether they are at the bottom of the curve or the top.",

More tightly written legislation can assuage this problem, and the majority themselves provided several solutions for relief that don't include taxpayer funded religious education. \n\n\nRulings like this might be tough to swallow, and we might even think the dissenting ruling is the correct one, but it isn't like the majority just went \"Hur, Catholics good!

So long as religious affiliated schools are private, I'm OK with their existence, however when state or federal funds start to support religious institutions, there goes the separation of church and state. I wouldn't want my child to be enrolled into a school that taught religious beliefs that I didn't support, and I don't want my tax dollars to support a religion I don't believe in. It's bad enough that religious institutions are tax exempt, and now their educational arm are getting tax dollars. No thanks.",

There are non-religious public schools and Catholic public schools.\n\nThis is how they spoke about it during the Confederation. \n\n> The concept that church and state are partners, not hostile and incompatible forces that must be kept at a distance, has made it possible for educational authorities in Canada to subsidize Jewish schools in Qu\u00e9bec and Hutterite schools on the Prairies, to condone Amish schools in Ontario, and to permit the Salvation Army to develop its own public schools in Newfoundland.\n\nHere\u2019s how it worked:\n\n> In Ontario, Alberta, and in other provinces, if there were enough families of a particular faith that wished to do so, they could set up a separate school, supported by the specially-directed taxes of those families who elected to support the separate school over the public schools. In practice, this gave a mechanism for Catholics to continue having their own schools. Separate schools tended to be Catholic in the south of Ontario whereas in northern Ontario, where the majority of people were Catholic, Protestants were the ones to set up separate schools. Yet, Catholic schools form the single largest system in Canada offering education with a religious component.",

What it's implying is that all private schools have to be treated the same, regardless of religious affiliation. \n\nSo if Maine wants to continue to include private schools in this publicly funded program, they must include the religious schools with it. To me, it's a way bigger can of worms for historical precedents to allow that than to just cut off the funding to go to any private schools at all.",

Religious schools shouldn't get taxpayer money because that's the government promoting a religion.\n\nExcept in the case of school choice, it *isn't* the government promoting a religion - the *parents* are through their choice. \n\nThe government is actually ambivalent about it, as long as academic criteria are being met.\n\nOtherwise, the only fair alternative is to give religious parents an equivalent tax credit or reimbursement for opting out of government non-religious education - but that ultimately amounts to the same thing. \n\n>(And as someone else pointed out elsewhere, the private school that has the most money - say the catholic church, worth about 10 trillion dollars - will build the most schools in rural / underserved areas and benefit from this de facto government promotion.)\n\nThat doesn't mean that school doesn't cost money, or that rural folk don't pay taxes.\n\n>The rhetorical sleight of hand that the government is giving the money to the parents and the parents are giving that money to the religious school doesn't change a thing.\n\nIt's not rhetorical, or sleight of hand- if our tax money is going to education, it should go to education we want. You in turn should be allowed to use tax money for the education you want - that is what fairness looks like. \n\nYou're really only saying that you want all tax dollars to go to the education *you* want, and that's simply discriminatory. \n\n>Additionally, schools are where people go to learn objective truths and the scientific method. Religion is completely antithetical to objective truth and the scientific method. \n\nThis statement is completely false. Your ignorance of it is evidence in support of school choice. \n\n>Finally, religion is a special interest group. If your child wants to learn about jesus, Kabuki Theatre, fly fishing, muscle cars, or electronics repair, you can pay for them to study privately, but we've decided as a society that it's not in everyone's best interest to publicly fund those special interests.\n\nThis also is objectively untrue - Public schools routinely teach specialty subjects such as drama (including Kabuki, if there's an interest) or ecology and conservation (in which hunting and fishing play important roles). Trade schools teach automobile and electronic repair, and the vast majority of post-primary public schools offer electives that can include every subject you just mentioned and many more - except religious instruction. \n\nReligious people should have the same level of choice that non-religious people do for their education - and if their taxes pay for one and not the other, that's most certainly not the same level of choice. \n\nThe fact is that people should be able to get what *they* want out of our school system - and government should be facilitating that, not hindering it.",
