He always tried to look everywhere else but my face so I would gently hold his little chin so he would know to focus on me. And I'd ask him why he did what he did or said what he said, and you're right. He'd start explaining and start tearing up. He knew he did wrong and felt guilty. We'd go over why it was wrong and say we were not going to do that again.\nI'm not a very good parent by any means but I did get that part right. The thought of spanking him just used to break my heart. His dad smacked him once and I flew out of my seat ready to fight lol. \n\nIt was funny because he was always the most well behaved kid at any event and everyone would ask what I did. When he did act like a brat, I'd just say \"would you like to take a trip to the bathroom?\" His response \"no, no mama. I be good. I be good ok?\" \nMy dad asked \"what the hell do you do to him in the bathroom?! Do you beat him or something?\" He asked in a jokingly way but I just told him I talked to him. He didn't like that feeling of guilt, so he did not like the trips to the bathroom.\n\nEdit: my parents spanked my siblings and I growing up. We were a bratty group of kids. We did associate getting spankings with being bad. But I think it's easier to get into shit when you have siblings. My dad hated spanking us but I guess did it because that's how he was raised. He would even come and apologize later because he felt so guilty. Then he'd talk to us. We all turned out alright. We're not traumatized by it. I just couldn't spank my own kid. He's gonna be 20 this year and sometimes now and want to have a go because he pisses me off lol.",

Many parents hate the idea of a paid therapist \"raising their kids\" but it's moreso like you got a professional godparent. \n\nThey won't have all the solutions but a therapist specializing in new married couples will fill in the gaps in your knowledge and you'll learn so much and be grateful for it.

It made me scared to have kids because we both want to BREAK the cycle, not perpetuate it with these terrible habits. \n\n\nKnowing that an apology really does work is so reassuring! I also never got any. Even now I don't from my parents. They just don't. They even say disparaging things like \"well I can't make it better\" or \"i can't fix the past\" or \"well I guess I'm just the worst\" when I mention things that really do need apologies. It kinda messes with your head when you've been told and taught all your life that you can't fix the mess ups so why even try. I never truly believed that, which is the root of many fights.\n\n\n But knowing it's TRUE is so amazing. you CAN apologize and make things better and it's ok.

But it is challenging to face-off with a kid who's patience is about as thin as yours. And when I'm depressed and have a lot of fatigue, I feel guilty for not having as much energy to play, but he doesn't seem to mind.\n\nI'm learning to find the value in what kind of mom I am and nor compare myself to other moms who are fully emotionally healthy. I love him with all my heart and everything I do is to make him happy. My issues cause me to analyze every action I take with him, but I'm okay knowing that I'm human and will make mistakes that I will apologize for. I just say this for people who do have issues and want kids, I know you said you didn't, and that as long as you're getting treatment and you are aware of your issues and how they affect others, you can be a good parent :)",

Namely raised under well meaning parents who were taught violence and severe punishment were the key to discipline. \n\nIts why I recommend therapy for parents cause therapists can provide insight on how to fix troublesome behaviors, and also sending a kid to therapy cause they're likely misunderstood or something underlying. \n\nThe kids I've essentially raised have guilt and empathy well into their early teenage years. As for other people's kids I treat them with respect like an adult. \nDoes that immediately undo their lifetime of poor parenting? No, probably doesn't even help better them as they're too far gone into their ways for me to fix with just a few hours of interaction. \n\nBut at least I won't be pushing them in the wrong direction and often I'll gain their trust and sometimes they reach out to me for treating them in a way few people in their life have. That's when I can start the healing process",

My grandmother use to ask my mom \"what have you done to this poor child?\" Because I was so well behaved with no punishments. I was never yelled or threatened. I was very quiet from a young age and my parents would tell me things like \"don't go into the roads, that's where cars are and it's dangerous\". So I would never go into the road. Just a very obedient kid who was talked to like a small human. Now. My little brother? Hell on wheels. My parents would be like \"don't touch the hot stove, it will burn you\". He would look them straight in the eyes and touch the stove. Didn't care that he got burned. Just wanted to do whatever my parents said no to. They would reason and explain. They would do time outs and have a nice talk and he'd run literally straight to do it all over again. He did not care about spanking either. They eventually tried that and it ended up upsetting me more than him so that never was really done a lot. Positive rewards like stickers and candy and books, I would go crazy for them. He could care less.  The only thing that ever worked on him was removing rewards. Like no Legos because you hit your sister. Or you can't go see your friend today because you threw food on the floor. So yes, most kids have things like guilt and if you speak to them and explain and do positive reinforcement, it will work. But some kids are just stubborn and LIVE to test the boundaries. Btw. He turned out to be a fine guy. Still stubborn as hell but actually loves his work in the military. It's like he craves order because his personality is still very much a \"disagree with you just for arguments sake and never conceed you have a good point\" that he needs a safe space to be told what to do. I guess the military works for him because he gave them permission to order him around when he enlisted. Very fascinating. Still love that weirdo.",

You don't really get a say in your kid's personalities and you don't get to return them either!

Just a strong willing kid who literally loved to disobey. Like I said, he turned out okay as person, but I was just pointing out that the recommended method of parenting doesn't always work for every kid. And it's not like there is a return program.lol you make one, you do your very best for 18 years to turn out a semi functional adult. It's going to be easy for some and hard as hell for others. I try to remember that when I see parents resorting to yelling or slapping. Like no, that's not a great idea and not helpful (and obviously not talking abuse here). But seeing it from the outside versus being in the trenches every day, I can see how parents snap and make poor calls sometimes.",

                              "text": "To be fair, this sounds like advice from someone who doesn\u2019t have kids, LOL.\n\nNot all kids feel guilt when they\u2019ve done something wrong, especially those younger than six or seven. It also depends on the kid, too. My oldest was always a very easy child who would mostly follow the rules, be polite, and not cause trouble. If you asked him to do something, he\u2019d do it, and he might give you a little bit of pushback but you could explain things to him or offer a reward, and he\u2019d understand. But my youngest? He\u2019d scream like a goddman siren and throw things until he got his way, and the only way to stop the tantrums was to physically pry him off you and put him in a childproof room with the door closed, where he\u2019d scream for another 30 minutes or so until he got tired. There was no reasoning or negotiating with him; absolutely nothing worked. Some kids just don\u2019t respond to gentle correction. \n\n>\tYou don\u2019t need to punish them further cause they punished themselves by feeling bad for upsetting you and they\u2019re ready to do what it takes to appease you\n\nNope. Reward systems are almost always better than punishments, in my opinion, but kids need to realize that their actions can have negative consequences too. You have to teach them that, and if you don\u2019t, they\u2019ll learn it the hard way when they\u2019re much older, when their actions have *real* consequences to them. Why would they want to appease you when they know *you\u2019ll* appease *them* at any opportunity? There\u2019s no incentive for them to modify their behavior. \n\nIf they mouth off to a cop, that police officer isn\u2019t going to sit down and explain gently why they shouldn\u2019t do that; your kid will just get arrested. If they cheat on their university exams, the dean won\u2019t call them up to their office for a nice chat and then send them on their way because feeling guilty is punishment enough; they\u2019ll kick their ass out of the school. If your kid is used to getting away with that as a child, they\u2019ll think they can get away with it as an adult too, and the world will be a harsh, tough wake up call for them. \n\nI\u2019m not advocating for abuse, but sometimes as a parent you have to be the bad guy. A gentle talk isn\u2019t enough, especially as they get older. They need to learn to respect you, because if they don\u2019t, they won\u2019t respect anyone else either. You also have to teach them how to respect themselves, which is where a lot of parents fail. Telling your kid they\u2019re a piece of shit isn\u2019t the way to go, but neither is telling them that they can do no wrong and everything will be OK no matter what they\u2019ve done, because it won\u2019t. \n\nThere have been times I\u2019ve told my kids not to do something, and they\u2019ll look me in the eye with a smile on their face, then turn around and do it right in front of me. Or even better, wait until I leave the room and do it when they think I\u2019m not looking. Bonus points if your kids conspire together for ways to get around your rules. You\u2019re outnumbered, and they know it. Part of growing up and learning boundaries is to test those boundaries, and that\u2019s why the toddler/teenage years are so challenging. If they learn that violating your boundaries is OK, they\u2019ll do it again, because why wouldn\u2019t they? They know you\u2019ll never stop them, and they can act however they want and still get their way. Yes they\u2019re your kids and you love them, but they can also be a little shitheads. Your job is to teach them otherwise.",

And that point about teaching kids about self respect and boundaries is great. \n\nAnd just cause you're explaining things to kids in a conversational way doesn't mean you have to be gentle. You can be Stern and provide consequences while throughly explain yourself and have your kid explain themselves in a non-aggressive manner.\n\nAnd the idea that children feeling guilty doesnt have to stem from fear of punishment. Most children I know have an inmate desire to be a good person and learn from others, and be appreciated, you just need to tap into that desires and goals when addressing issues so they're self motivated to achieve those expectations rather than only achieving exception if they're consequence. \n\nAnd you're right I don't have kids, I generally take care of a lot of younger cousins and neighbors kids even though it's not my thing cause of my reputation for \"fixing\" kids even though I hate that idea that they're broken, I just provide them with an environment where they feel they can be kids but also treated like adults in a healthy way\n I don't have to experience the worst part of parenting I just see a glimpse for improvements I can make and rehash what I say from my therapist and it works more often than not.",

A gentle talking-to may work most of the time for some kids, but you have to know your kids and know what works. Boundaries are real, consequences are real, and understanding that begins in the home. \n\nAt a recent childcare training seminar I attended, there was a case study where one child repeatedly misuses a toy to the point of hurting another kid in the classroom. Someone in the audience was against taking the toy away, saying that \u201cthere must be a deeper psychological reason why that child won\u2019t listen.\u201d I wanted so badly to tell him, sometimes it\u2019s just not that deep. Of course be on the lookout for warning signs of abuse or developmental issues. But it\u2019s in a child\u2019s nature to test boundaries, and some kids just really like breaking rules. They need a firmer hand, and it\u2019s really a disservice to the child to deny them the structure they need. \n\nIf someone has a child who generally doesn\u2019t need lots of discipline and responds well to gentle guidance, that\u2019s great! But realize that others may have tried that and it doesn\u2019t work well for their children. I never used to understand those parents struggling with their kids falling out in the grocery stores etc. Then we took in a foster child and I realized that every child *really is* different. (And for some kids nothing is going to work and you just do your best to keep them from self destructing. Hopefully they\u2019ll grow out of it.)",

Especially, after explaining the right way several times in a row. Now I do get frustrated every now and then and want to punch an especially difficult co-worker in the throat. But again, I was taught the wrong way. Now, I find it very eloquent when someone can explain things in a way which people understand. I struggle between that and fits of rage which I now see as just plain dumb. If that makes sense. I use my brain instead of my fists when dealing with difficult people. \n\nFinally, you should see when I try to explain this  to other grown adults why hitting as punishment is wrong.

I never hit my kids, saved my yelling for really bad times, and they would cry just from a yell. Because I picked my battles and other times just explained why you can't do that. Did explaining work instantaneously like a smack?  No but usually after 5 minutes of whining they move on to something else. Their dad did hit them, we were divorced. \n\nSo now my son has 3 and he smacks them, which saddens me. But they're his kids so I try not to butt in to his parenting. I watch them all the time and they tell me'secrets' and say don't tell my mom and dad but I said 'bitch'  or don't tell them but I stayed up really late and played on my tablet.  And I just say oh wow u must have been so tired at school the next day and they're like yeah. Like they know already no need to smack them. I feel like my kids growing up told me ALOT because they knew they could. Who knows but I just could never see what hitting could bring good other than relieving MY aggravation, which it wouldn't anyway bc I'm just not a hitter. Now you just have a crying kid who hates you more. And once they get into the teens they're bigger than you anyway lol. \n\nYour absolutely spot on that kids want to make you happy and the guilt is worse than any smack imo.",

Or that they are stronger than the bad emotions and they can deal with them in better ways, and give them the tools to do just that? Children have very little power, crying is one of the only ways they know to get what they want. You do have to teach them that screaming and crying is not going to get them what they want, but you also have to teach them how to be so that they can get what they want, and then wait until they have the maturity to act that way.",

I was on the brink of insanity with this child and knew something was very, very off even though she had none of the markers for the spectrum. Eventual diagnoses: ADHD, ODD, and, most importantly, SPD which are sensory triggers that invoke the Fight or Flight response... so noises, temperatures, bright lights, etc etc etc there are a million triggers... was causing her to lash out when she was overstimulated and had no other outlet to escape the unpleasant state of being she was in.\n\nEveryone in my family told me I was soft and I needed to \"whack her a good one\" and were convinced she was absolutely fine, neurologically, and was simply spoiled because I wasn't be a good mother. \n\nIt was infuriating since I was spending hours on the phone with crisis centers, etc trying to get my child evaluated so I would finally know why she was so violent ... shes 8 now and has/ had a TON of therapy and is very manageable now, but mannnnnnnn those first 3-4 years were hell, for us as well as her and especially her. Its a torturous existence if it goes untreated. \n\nAnd to be constantly told to hit her into submission is just appalling to me. I really hate Spanking culture. Its so fucking unnecessary.",

If i misbehaved or just didn\u2019t stop crying, he made sure that he will come off as scary so that i will do my best to avoid tgose moments. But whenever i was a good kid, he took his free time after a hard Job and he played with me, watched TV with me or even took me to the Park so that i wanted more of these moments.\n\nDo i have issues?

If my Pa would\u2019ve dragged my Ass to some \"specialist\" he too would\u2019ve said i had probably Bipolar or ADHD or some other shit i actually wouldn\u2019t have and would describe him to go and do the wrong things.

It's very illegal, even in states where spanking is totally legal.   \n\nI'm sorry that you grew up in a home that instilled this really warped view of love and discipline, and that viewed mental illness and neurological disorders as character weakness. It's clearly left you with some toxic views and a frightening lack of empathy. Your dad would have helped you a lot more as well as probably the people by taking you to that specialist, frankly. It's not too late for you though to go get therapy and work on unlearing some of the poisonous stuff you've internalized over the course of your life. \n\nIn fact, please don't have children or be around them until you do.

My mother never spanked me when I was young but I did piss her off enough to backhand me in my face one time, don't remember what it was but she put my braces through my lip.\n\nI never had aggression because of it, didn't hit people or act like I'd hit them and shit like that and I was bullied through 5th-8th grade.  I stood up for people who couldn't at school once I hit 9th grade, I hit a big growth spurt and gained a lot of confidence and I only fought protecting other people.  Except one time, I fought my bully in 9th grade.\n\nI know I'm probably not the norm but almost everyone grew up like that that are like 35+.",

Maybe not with a knife, but they will consciously, maliciously, and relentlessly devalue and gaslight you until you lose your mind. You MUST learn to break out of their grip and most importantly learn to avoid narcs in the future. See what this girl did? \"You can't treat people like that, I'm sorry about your situation but leave and don't come back\". She nailed the response.\n\n I finally ended that relationship a year ago and while I'm happy to be free of it, the damage has been done. The tiniest signs of affection now trigger floods of memories and emotions that will send me into catatonia.\n\nDon't let that be you.",

It's spot on.\n\nOf course narcissists don't like that, because they're used to being able to push the \"drama\" button and get their way, be it via crying, screaming, hitting, threatening, or whatever other tantrum-style technique will work.  Some of them even like it when the other person resorts to the same thing, because they expect and understand the reciprocation rather than a calm, rational, sensible discussion about limits and consequences.  They're usually losers, so even if it's 50-50 whether they'll \"win\" the fight, they consider those odds good.\n\nSo, they turn into a 5-year-old in an adult body and do the thing that used to get their parents to do what they wanted. The parents never established boundaries, and they grew up that way, trying to press the same buttons when dealing with anyone in their way.  Maybe the person will promptly cave out of the shock of seeing an adult behaving that way?  It's worth a try because it always worked before (\"I want to speak to your manager\").\n\nNot disciplining a child, by which I mean giving them real consequences for their bad actions, is how you raise a self-interested little monster that eventually grows into an even worse adult who doesn't care about anyone else.  I mean, what kind of adult thinks because you're paying someone you can treat them like this?  A pretty damaged one.  I'd feel more sympathy if they weren't such awful people.\n\nIt's important to emphasize that \"discipline\" does not mean physical discipline, it only means real and appropriate consequences like what the hairdresser did in this case: do something wrong, and you can deal with the shitty consequences of having your hair in a shambles while you're on the equivalent of adult \"time out\" (\"get out of my place of business\").",

You learned bad behaviours from your mum and now is the time to unlearn them or we can divorce right now. From then on every time she shouted i left the room until she stopped. \n\nShe didnt realise it was wrong because she had seen it growing up but 10 years later she hasnt hit again or excessively shouted (everyone shouts but not the constant crap her mum did). I cant even imagine her reaction if id ever made a move to hit her like she tried. No way we wouldnt be divorced. Violence has no place in a marriage. \n\nWhere i grew up you learned if you hit someone you will get hit back. All these women raised watching their mother use violence and never be retaliated against caused this idea that its ok for women to be abusive. 100% think this is cause of the karen nonsense.",

It can feel much easier to be sympathetic to someone with an \"easier\" mental health issue like depression or anxiety, but since personality disorders are CHARACTERIZED by being difficult towards other people...yeah, it's tough.\n\nUltimately though, it's about setting boundaries for me.  I won't judge someone for their mental health condition. I WILL judge them by whether or not their condition is fuelling toxic behavior, because mental health is an explanation, not an excuse. For example, I have ADHD. Some of my chronic problems pre-treatment were lateness and forgetting about events. Obviously this has a negative impact on other people, so my job in managing my ADHD is to not make my symptoms someone else's problem. Rather than just saying \"I have ADHD, it's not my fault I can't remember things, deal with it\" (a response which an old roommate of mine used to use and a toxic one) I've made an effort to help myself remember things and be on time (i.e. setting multiple alarms to remind me about things, including giving me enough extra time to get ready).  And if I am still late, I apologize and don't blame my ADHD. \n\nSo for people with BPD or other personality disorders, if they are aware of their behavior, actively working on improving, and apologize when they cause harm, I'm not totally unwilling to be around them. But if they're out of control and acting abusive towards me or others without apology? Hell no I'm not sticking around, because I have to protect myself first and foremost.",

It\u2019s not about the offending person, it\u2019s about the victim. And then the most important part is the actions that back up that apology, where the offender works to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again and changes their behavior. Words without action to back them up, are just that: words. And you can tell, from her tone of voice, from offering weak excuses, for only speaking on her side of the story (not how she made the stylist feel), and what she\u2019ll lose because of it, that this Karen was only sorry it happened because it\u2019s now causing HER trouble and HER hair won\u2019t look good.

I told her if she ever spoke to me that way again she better hope we weren\u2019t alone doing a procedure on an anesthetized animal bc I\u2019d be walking out the door. \n\nHer POS husband had a clinic nearby and they asked me to sub when he was shorthanded. He came on to me like a dog in heat so I guess she *did* have stress lol. \n\nI quit soon after that ain\u2019t got time for veterinary dramaz.",

Definitely seems like the right thing to do even if people don\u2019t fully believe her because she\u2019s not showing the full thing. In cases like these since she was obviously in the situation herself, if it was the case that this woman was being racist, then she would obviously notice more subtle things that viewers might not.\n\nWith her refering to Latina coworkers as spicy people. Obviously that\u2019s weird and she shouldn\u2019t say that, but I wouldn\u2019t say that\u2019s anything to do with not understanding racism. It\u2019s quite common with if she\u2019s a bit uneducated to say weird things like that without realizing. Not straight up defending it and saying she should carry on but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a massive issue.\n\nRegardless I don\u2019t see a reason for her lying about it being racially motivated that the woman didn\u2019t want the assistant to work on her hair. In the first place she\u2019s been refused from other salons clearly for being difficult in some sort of way. But even if none of that was true, the hairdresser has no need to lie and sway people to her side. She was already clearly in the right and everyone was on her side to begin with.",

All she had to do was post the entire video, and she refused to do that, while gaslighting anyone who questioned that choice.\n\nIt doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand why people do stuff like this. It works.\nCalling Robin a racist Karen, completely destroys any sympathy/empathy for her, while making the Salon owner look even better. \n\nNot providing evidence for a accusation that you continue to defend, is never acceptable. This is already a very public issue, and the owner has no problem repeating the racism accusations. So I find it very hard to believe that she is has any appreciation for Robin's well being or mental state.\n\nGo watch the Salon owner's response video to all of this. It had me go from being a fan, to being super sketched out by her.\nThe spicy coworkers comment, is just one of many out of touch and/or questionable choices.",

Robin is clearly a sack of shit, no two ways around it, but I feel like this was a pretty convenient setup so Sharon could come in and \"save\" her assistant.\n\nDefinitely did notice the lack of assistant too. I don't think during the entire video I heard her at all. That actually makes sense seeing as that wouldn't really vibe well with Sharon's hero script though. The assistant is really one of those \"you have this one line\" supporting characters to the main act.",

She does literally say it\u2019s her first Vlog. Part of the issue for me was it felt very self-aggrandizing. Like she really played up how great it was she spotted racism and took it down. Which, let me be clear, that is great and I\u2019m happy she did it. It just seemed very much patting herself on the back, which just comes down to presentation. She\u2019ll probably do better in later vlogs. It\u2019s a learning experience.",

And that's why it's ok for me to tell people I'm better than them. \n\nRacism is *really serious* so when a non-racist like me comes along and tells you I'm better than you, you better listen. Preventing racism is *never* a bad thing which should be obvious because I *never* do it. \n\nAlmost no one else in the world is capable of going even a single day without committing dozens of hate crimes, but I have a rare level of self control that others just lack. If everyone was like me, the world would be a perfect place. But unfortunately, my level is just beyond the reach of others'\n\nSo when you see one of those heros in our society like me or the lady in the video, don't fret when we get on our high horses. We deserve that high horse, because we are better than other people. So there's nothing wrong with it!",

While others claim that exposing the \"nitpicky\" stuff is necessary to show just how pervasive stuff like this really is. \n\nI see merits to both viewpoints. I would call what she did in the video essentially a microaggresssion. As to how important you consider it, I leave it up to you to decide for yourself because I do see merit to multiple viewpoints.

All I can do is notice it when its been triggered and redirect their thoughts and emotions to a more constructive state, which I feel I did. Just not before I hit send sadly lmao. Over time practice will make it get better, but trauma rarely ever goes away completely.  So I edited out the part where I was projecting and left the parts that were objectively true. I could have just deleted it but I don't like to do that unless I messed up REALLY bad lol.\n\nNothing that could have been done to avoid it here since it was just someone posting it for context, but if there ever was an audience that needed a trigger warnings for abused / depressed men, it's reddit lol.\n\nSorry for perceiving rudeness, your comment was not very confrontational.  I just get sick of how much people hate on the lonely \"neckbeards\" living in their parents basement alone because they don't know how / want to live. It's a massively growing mental health issue and they tend to be found here on reddit. But the amount of people who make fun of and insult people suffering from it is insane. If they are anything like me they are just being told things they already think about themselves daily and it just makes them hate themselves more because they know the solution. Then the self hate causes them to isolate even more making the problem worse and driving them to suicide if they don't make it out of the cycle. In group therapy I realized this problem is rampant, like half of the people there were stuck in this cycle or something similar. People on the internet constantly making fun of people like them just makes it exponentially worse.",

People find circumstantial ways to disrespect others, so that when they\u2019re exposed it\u2019s easier for them to discredit the victim. \n\nBut honestly, let\u2019s not throw out the baby with the bath water. Why are we nitpicking over syntax and the surrounding events that we did not see? We weren\u2019t there. What we did see was Robin behaving deplorably, carrying on in a manner no adult should. I\u2019m sure we all agree on that. \n\nPeople, especially those from Robin\u2019s generation, have a warped view of what respect is, and that\u2019s to the tenth degree in customer service of any kind. The way she spoke was as if she was entitled to a *service.* If you don\u2019t like the way someone runs their business, you take your money elsewhere. And they have the right to refuse you a service, all the moreso if you\u2019re belligerent and threaten violence over hair color. \n\nAltogether short sighted of Robin to pick a fight like that when there\u2019s already chemicals in her hair.",

I will judge based on what I see, and I personally think the hairdresser is out of line for pressing the matter. Robin is hopeless here because the hairdresser is being a bitch, she's acting like a level headed sweetheart but that's only because she knows she holds ALL the chips. She she is enjoying this way to much, and she even drives the knife into the wound by making the video with wild accusations.

My point was, since we are the product of our genetics and environment, thus when 2 people with different genetic makeup were raised in the exact SAME environment (not similar, but exact the same, same nutrient same air same experience same everything ) then the difference between those two would only be genetics. Our brain is plastic therefore can totally override it but it needs a different environment. If the person is very unlucky and never had a better environment then sadly the outcome. I am stating all this because I wish people can be more compassionate towards the others if knowing there is so little we are in control of.",

I, being older, was able to pretty much see it for what it was and deal with it on my own fairly effectively, but my sister was just a baby when she contracted and survived bacterial spinal meningitis, which I'm almost positive caused some brain damage. My sister grew up wanting \"mom.\" HER mom, who was abusive. So, she made excuses for her for 20 years. She's only recently decided that everyone was right in telling her to cut her mother off, but it's because our mother has changed in her old age to be slightly more compassionate. My sister isn't continuing the cycle because she's stupid, but because she doesn't know or care how to be better.",

We can assign responsibility to people for the actions they take, we can make their actions have consequences, and we can refuse to let them excuse their behavior by using explanations such as \"I wasn't in control because my parents beat me\" or \"I wasn't in control because I drank too much\". However, it has been repeatedly demonstrated that people can lose control of their actions; that's why we have words like \"triggered\", and linguistically distinguish between \"rage\" and \"anger\", and judicially distinguish between crimes of passion and premeditated murder. It has also been repeatedly demonstrated that people make (incorrect) impulsive judgements that greatly influence the decisions they make and are based on a variety of hardwired factors, many of which they can't control -- that's why Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahnmen wrote the book *Thinking, Fast and Slow*.\n\nPsychology and psychiatry use a threshold model to describe the likelihood that someone will act violently. Every human being has this threshold. For some, this threshold is really high -- maybe you'll only act violently to defend yourself or defend someone else. For others, this threshold is much lower, and they get pushed over the threshold by experiences they have in the past, such as being violently beaten as a child or witnessing repeated death and human rights abuses in a war. Both of these experiences can cause them to be triggered, maybe the PTSD might make the child have nightmares or the veteran jump when they hear a loud noise. Is the child choosing to have nightmares? Is the veteran choosing to jump when they hear a loud noise? At what point do their triggered actions become \"choices\"?\n\nOnly when they're voluntarily behaving a certain way are they choosing to do something, hence my original argument: make them responsible, make their actions have consequences. But don't be so unsympathetic and close minded as to say they're always and everywhere choosing to do something. \n\nTake the children away, if need be. Definitely give both the children and the parent mental health services. End the cycle of violence.\n\nAnd, since you want to fixate on this woman, people who become habituated to violence need years of psychological and psychiatric help to break out of their patterns and heal themselves, usually also addressing the shit they experienced. Is she a bad apple? Yes. Does  that invalidate her humanity and the need for her injuries to recieve proper, respectful medical attention? Fuck no.",

Being a product of our society and our childhood, however, is true for all of us. And how we choose to act is\u2026 a choice. You choose to rob the bank, to kill the person, to assault your hairdresser. Those are all choices.\n\nWe all have triggers but we choose to act differently in them. You\u2019re naive to think that those who choose not to hit a child, just happen so not have triggers. They do, and you have several anecdotes in this thread of people who feel like doing so but don\u2019t.\n\nIf you believe that we are all but products of society, and that no action is a choice but rather a reaction to the inner mind built during childhood, then you can\u2019t blame me for blaming all these people for their actions. My view that criminals deserve to be in prison, and that you and only you are responsible for your action, well\u2026 that mindset of mine is due to me being a product of society. Isn\u2019t it? Or do you hold different people to different standards? Should I be responsible for *choosing* throwing people into prison and blaming them for everything they do, but they shouldn\u2019t be responsible for *choosing* to commit a crime?",

Your emotions, thoughts, and perceptions can be driven by and *very* influenced by those personality disorders. Your behaviors are how you choose to react to it. Outside of some very specific medical maladies that might involve involuntary physical behaviors, personality disorders can be managed and behaviors controlled even though it may take great effort and is very difficult. We can understand and empathize with this but, we cannot let it excuse behaviors as uncontrollable.",

Needs to hear that this isn't a perfect and unrealistic pipedream.\n\nThat most people actually do not behave badly, and their status quo isn't hurting people unless they take great care to not.

It\u2019s probably because you only *noticed* shitty behavior being done by women, because they were women and assumed it would be women doing it. It\u2019s like when nobody really notices or cares when a white guy is just walking down their street, but when a black guy does it, all of a sudden he\u2019s \u201csuspicious\u201d and \u201cup to no good\u201d and \u201clook at the way he\u2019s scoping out all the houses\u201d. A man says, \u201cI have to return this camera, it doesn\u2019t work\u2026.All I can get is store credit? Man, that sucks\u2026.\u201d Poor guy, I mean, that\u2019s store policy, but you have to sympathize with him. Woman says literally the exact same thing, she\u2019s being a Karen. You forget the guy two seconds after he leaves the service desk. You remember the woman because she was just so awful, as women are.\n\nWhen I worked retail I made the same assumption, until it was pointed out to me that the threshold for a woman being a nasty customer was much lower than it was for a man. Women are perceived as being \u201cnasty\u201d or \u201ca bitch\u201d just for not being totally pleasant or happy about literally anything, whereas a man\u2019s complaint is valid unless he\u2019s really being an asshole about it.",

So perhaps because I dealt with more women customers the numbers feel a bit skewed. Perhaps if I worked in a retail environment in which men were the majority customers it would be different. I have witnessed both genders complain because they are not happy. That is not what I am referring too. I have seen old women treat employees like they are sub human. Talking to them in ways people wouldn\u2019t talk to a dog. On several occasions I\u2019ve witnessed old ladies throw things at deli clerks. Of course people who make minor complaints and are upset about something are of both genders. But the truly egregious behavior was always committed by old women in my experience.",

If you had the money people would allow themselves to be degraded to no end to keep that job.  It was just accepted that you would be treated like shit by customers and management alike and you would take your paycheck and shut up.  \n\nWith the money you then earned you can go to other businesses and feel like a king/queen because now *you* are the customer.  It's just another form of the cycle of abuse. Thank god for people like in the video who are making the stand.  Because that's how you get them to stop, we all refuse to take that kind of crap. \n\nI'd started my highest ever paying job ever as a web dev.  It was doing the internal systems of a collection of real estates.  The first time the owner came into our office he made a comment about if his son turned out to be gay he would drown him.  \n\nI was balls deep in a project that only I could effectively finish, so these guys needed me more than anything right now. So I sent an email to him saying that I didn't appreciate what he said in the office and that he needs to apologise to everyone for saying such a thing.  Joking or not, that's not appropriate in this environment (not that it overly matters, but keep in mind that this was an office with many graphics designers who anecdotally seem to be either gay or female).  \n\nHe responds denying ever saying such a thing.... Fuck it.... If he's going to lie and deny even saying such a thing I'm out.   I waited until the end of the day stood up, announced that I couldn't and wouldn't work for someone who is willing to say those kinds of things to his employees, handed my resignation, turned to the manager and said \"this is my 2 weeks notice, but I feel a bit of a cough coming on *cough cough* so I hope I can make it in the next 2 weeks, please make sure my sick pay is paid and my remaining holiday accounted for otherwise I'm going to need to take this matter further.\"  On the way out I got a lot of male designers thanking me deeply and others giving me a nod of approval.  \n\nSometimes you gotta take the hit to encourage change.  I can only hope that dickhead thinks twice before doing that again. \n\nThanks for coming to my TED talk.",

Then when I was in my early twenties, at my family gathering, my brother threw a baby toy and accidentally hit my older niece with it and she started crying and saying he did it on purpose. My dad acted shocked that my brother could do such a thing (it was an accident??, and my father has  deliberately done much, *much* worse), turned to my mother, looked her in the eyes and, I shit you not, said the words, \u201cYou hit them a lot more than I did.\u201d\n\nHe said that my mother had hit my brother and me \u201ca lot more\u201d than he, my father, had when we  were children. I\u2019ll tell you what, I would\u2019ve really wanted to hit him *then* if I wasn\u2019t so shocked. He was so blas\u00e9 about it, like he was stating a basic fact that was clearly obvious.

The flabbergasted \"Oh my gawd!\", she kept blurting out tells me she was genuinely shocked she was not allowed to bully, manipulate, and gaslight someone.\n\nI could be wrong, but I've dealt with my fair share of narcissists and this is pretty much how they act.",

You did say everyone is as evil as her. That is literally the only point of your failed excuse.\n\n>*To say this woman is evil for a hair salon meltdown is strange*\n\nNo, it's the very definition of evil to think you can treat people so horribly. The only people who would defend such indefensible behavior are trying to assuage their guilt.\n\n>*Calling me dishonest because I push back on the endorphin rush of judging everyone\u2019s entire life on a two-minute video is also bizarre.*\n\nNever happened. You were held fairly accountable for your sociopathic defense of this women's indefensibly evil toxicity. There is literally nothing that justifies her behavior and everyone knows it.",

Yea most owners want asskissers cause they care more about the extra dollar in their pocket they get each time the Karen comes back than their workers mental health.

Also there were more customers where I've stuck with cause they always had \"excellent customer service\" when the reality is we were just content with our jobs  so we were in a mental space to help the nice customers and many co-workers worked there for years and know the ins and out to help the customer best they can. And we weren't constantly stressed by customers just so the owner could get an extra car payment in. \n\nI don't regret leaving the service industries but I had some good times back then cycling through workplaces until I found a diamond",

In addition to that, in standard grammar the masculine form is also the neutral one, especially when talking to group of mixed gendered individuals. Why? I don't know but anything different just sounds weird.\n\nMy personal problem with Hispanic, is that it does not include Latin American countries that don't have Spanish heritage, such as Brazil, Haiti and the Guyanas. So unless you're talking specifically about spanish speaking countries, it is not a precise word. Iberian also includes Portugal, but anyway\n\nLatino makes even less sense as it tries to generalise an enormous group of people with little in common, but I guess it would apply to words such as \"European\" or \"Asian\" as well. \n\nLastly pardon my English, I'm aware that I need to improve it lol",

Yet people name their cars girls names all the time and it isn't seen as weird because said \"gender\" is just a particle that we have to use to make sentences work, same with the ending of words, we're not really attributing any gender related qualities to things (everything is gendered, even abstract concepts, for example concept is \"he\" while idea is \"she\") is simply a grammatical rule that makes our language work. We tend to use masculine as the \"neutral gender\" but it's not always the case \"persona\" (person) for example can mean any gender, while the word itself is female, I can say \"Marcos es una buena persona\" (Marcos is a great person) and it's just a normal sentence so when people try to make it into personE It makes very little sense because it was already a neutral word. \n\nI think romance languages just have so many nonsensical rules and non-rules tbh that makes certain things hard to adopt, but who knows what will happen, around here while most are not cool with these new terms they don't mind exploring better alternatives which I see as a sign that change will come eventually.",

Doesn\u2019t change the facts (where I said White Euro-centric colonizers have spent the majority of modern history subjugating black and brown peopl AND each other).\n\nIn fact some of our most recent progress in navigation and astronomy came from North Atlantic Slave trade. Nobody is \u201ccancelling\u201d the fucking compass, or the charting of the stars, or the cartographical mapping of the world. I don\u2019t see any Western philosophy programs in the world cancelling Plato because slaves were part of his vision of an ideal state. \n\nAnd there\u2019s a complete lack of outcry more recently. There\u2019s nobody saying we have to cancel modern medicine because Josef Mengele was an unmatched goddamn monster. Nobody seems upset about giving a bunch of Nazi scientists a free pass to help the US (well it belongs to human-kind) build the Saturn-V rocket. \n\nTo be completely honest, insolent human cohabitant, I want to be on the right side of now. \n\nMany of the horrible things in history have progressed science. And conversely, many wonderful and BEAUTIFUL things have. We are a young and ignorant species. We continue to make the mistakes we\u2019ve made historically now. \n\nWe\u2019re quite literally shitting in our own drinking water still. There is a near certain possibility that we will destroy our civilization. But there is still a chance that we won\u2019t destroy OURSELVES. \n\nAt the end of all of this. Global white supremacy is an undeniable FACT. There is an historical disproportionate wealth gap between white folks and black and brown folks. \n\nTHE FIRST STEP to achieving our cosmic dreams is to lift billions of people (of every race) out of poverty and to create a sustainable future on our home base. The earth. A fragile and tiny planet in a vast universe. \n\nWe\u2019ve fucked that up. Billions of us will die in the next decade. And billions more die still, depending on our collective will to act. \n\nI truly hope the both of us live to contribute something worthwhile to this beautiful existence. \n\nHow strange it is to be anything at all.",

So obviously she is committed to have it done by the person she knows. And that's what she pays for.\n\nPrep work really should be fine and given Robin said she wants it done by the shop owner also her expections are set. If she delegates prep work it must be reliable and she knows that it's within her training level.\n\nThe shop owner really talks good. She protects her assistent and stands up for her. Also put a clear line what is ok and what not. While the message is very strong and the totality is very soft. So it equals out and shows social intelligence also towards Robin who didn't get the initial warning. Going hard in message and hard in tonality ends in a mess, same for soft soft.\n\nI think it's an amazing video. So much you can learn from this.",

I reported it to HR, but as there are no cameras where it happened (we have cameras at the exits only) nothing came of it. Unfortunately, she threatened me in a conference room as we were setting up a surprise party for someone, and they didn't have cameras.\n\nShe was never disciplined for it, and she proceeded to send me a nasty eMail ***to my home eMail address,*** while I was out on short term disability for a surgery. \n\nI sent that to HR.\n\nWhen I came back, the girl had gone out of ST Disability a week before my return. I heard *nothing* from HR (because it's obvious who attacked who in that eMail), but my boss was friends with the girl I filed the complaint against. After a few days he met with me and dressed me down to make me feel like shit.\n\nHe didn't say anything about my work being bad, it was all feedback regarding how he felt about me on a personal level. \"If I had a choice, I would never choose to work with you because of how you carry yourself.\" He also said that he needed to see changes in \"me\" (personality wise) before the end of the year, or he'd mark it against me in my review.\n\nI thought about it for a week, then reported him to HR as well. They got me in touch with my managers boss and we discussed the incident. He assured me that I did not have to change my personality for my year end review, because that's ridiculous. My reviews should be based on performance, production, work ethic, teamwork, etc.\n\nThe ***real reason*** my manager said this to me?\n\nI keep to myself. I'm not a social butterfly. At the time, I'd read my Kindle on the way to or from the bathroom/ breaks/ lunch. I wasn't socially active at work, and I do NOT kiss ass.",

He lashed out at his customers and his Google review of his business plummeted with many reviewers calling him rude.

Last I spoke to him he was asking about my  research where I was designing what is now NASA's accepted prototype venusian atmospheric explorer drone. My uncle asked about it and then texted \"AHA, that proves climate change isn't real\". While I was explaining to him the basic science of the planet.\n\nHis analysis was real fucking dumb by the way. He asked why Venus was so hard to send stuff to compared to Mars. I said while it is our planetary neighbor on the other side, and It is most similar to earth of all the planet, Venus suffers from having a really fucking hot atmosphere. It was then my uncle chortled in delight that he had bested science.\n\nI countered with mentioning that those changes happened to Venus over millions of years due to planet naturally wrapping its self in greenhouse gasses. We are doing that to earth at a record pace. Its fucking crazy that we are willingly creating the apocalypse that our sister planet died from.\n\nMy uncle wouldn't listen, didn't care, he had one and was off to tell his buddys that NASA lied, despite me not being a NASA employee or him being any semblance of correct.",

I came here to see my stylist, and I paid for my stylist, but instead I was getting this other girl. So I asked if I could get my stylist, and then she came over and I thought everything was good. I told her that she's supposed to do what the customer says, because that's why I'm PAYING her to do my hair. But for some reason suddenly my stylist had an issue with that, and she forced me to go out with this half-dyed hair. Honestly, it's ridiculous. How could she treat a loyal customer like that? And to think that I helped her small business, too.\"\n\nI love my mom, and she is the sweetest person... if you're not a service worker. She never gets anywhere near this bad, though -- I've never, ever seen her cuss someone out or act violently. If she can't get her way after (assertively) talking to a manager she'd just leave and \"take her business elsewhere.\" Then she'd tell everyone all about how Five Guys is bad because the employee there didn't put enough salt on her fries (or whatever).\n\nIt made my sister and I _very_ understanding when we became service workers, haha.

Some of the ladies are fierce enough to talk shit in front of them and these good customers will not hesitate to get right up in her face if Karen tries to get physical and assault a small Asian lady\n\nAlso the owner is really nice and gives me discounts and soy milk cause I'm Vietnamese",

I've had color go terribly wrong. It's never \"just color.\" Lots of people screw up very simple color and cuts all the time and if I'm paying for a particular stylist to do my hair then I do not want a trainee. If I wanted that then I'd pay a quarter of the price to get my hair done at a cosmetology school and accept that it might get ruined. The stylist should never assume that it's okay to train someone on her paying customer's hair even if the customer doesn't normally suck.",

Why didn\u2019t she ask her why she wouldn\u2019t let her trainee to preform the work? If there was an issue with racism it would have been something brought in the convo. No where in the video do they touch on racism. It all has to do about not wanting a trainee coloring her hair.\n\nI think the stylist is racist for even having that assumption. Especially since there\u2019s a clear reason provided (paying a stylist to do the work, but not receiving the work from the stylist her self.) that\u2019s completely reasonable. saying that it was racism is so out there of a claim looking at that interaction go down.\n\nThe stylist completely pushes back on her customers issue by saying that \u201cshe has a business to run\u201d. That stylist is attempting to invalidating the issue the entire time. Until she goes to assault the stylist lol. Robin loses everything at that point.\n\nI\u2019m sorry, trainee should be paying to train. I have a buddy whose wife is always going to classes enhance her craft. Having a trainee work on your paying customer is so disrespectful to attempt. Not only that, she pushes to pass it on by saying that she has a business to run. Fuck that dude. \n\nAnother thing, as soon as the stylist says the trainee would work on her hair this customer jump on that shit really quickly. She went 0-100 fast.

Allegedly she already knew she would be working with a trainee at the time of scheduling and only had an issue once she saw the trainee, but there's no way to know if that's true or not. Maybe they'd already agreed on a trainee rate and Robin forgot and thought she was being charged the full fee. Who knows.\n\nI understood where the stylist was coming from with what she was trying to say and getting interrupted. What I thought she was trying to get across was basically \"I have a whole business and have to have employees or I couldn't run it, and I have to be able to train them.\" \n\nAlso, I give the stylist's word quite a bit more weight since she's apparently the last one in town that was even willing to schedule Robin. She's obviously done *something* to gain this reputation. She doesn't have much credibility in this context. All she did was whine about her entitlement to the stylist's services simply because she had money. She could have all the money in the world and still be turned away for her attitude. Someone did her a favor and all she could do was bitch about it (and then put on the crocodile tears as soon as she knew she was being recorded).",

It's an afterthought on these people's minds which leads me to believe it was an afterthought on the ordeal as well. The moment Robin got physical was when it went too far but then they want to say \"oh, and by the way, she is racist\" just leads me to believe that there might have been more to this story which there is.\n\nFrom the article we find out that Robin was basically pawned off on to an assistant when she was told that her hair was going to be done by the person she asked for. She wasn't happy with this and threw a fuss.

Because \"correcting\" GFR based on race has been thrown out, and so has \"correcting\" lung function tests. \n\nUsing race as a proxy only looks good on paper, at best and is furthering systemic racism. Using race as a proxy has resulted in a medical system where BIPOC people have worse outcome measures across a huge range of issues; from kidney care to child birth to cancer. \n\nContinuing to cite statistics created by a medical system rife with bias is not actually good care. \n\n\n\n> 1. Of course one may choose a practioner of their own ethnicity, but if the difference isn't in expertise it seems to be lie within the patient. Is a doctor responsible if their patient is less cooperative because of the doctor's race?\n\nThis is a shit take and awful way to interpret any discussion of communication issues between patients and doctors. The onus of clear communication is on the physician, and physicians failing to learn about or consider differences in communication is a failure of the medical education system.",

They warned her that \u201cshe was a lot\u201d\n\n-Robin and the stylist spoke 2 weeks Prior where Robin was told about the assistant and told she would be applying the hair color. Which was agreed upon. When Robin walked in to the appointment she looked at the assistant and decided she didn\u2019t want her to touch her hair.\n\n-The stylist says Robins a racist. She says it\u2019s subtle racism that has leaked out over years. Robin has been openly derogatory to the Mexican community and the stylist and the assistant [have talked about how they felt her racism](https://wearemitu.com/wearemitu/things-that-matter/hairstylist-defending-latina-assistant/) slowly coming out \n\nThe [uncropped video](https://youtu.be/95YDay9sTN4) is wild cause the assistant is sitting there the whole time. **awkward**",

Robin should have been explicitly told that her appointment would be with the assistant when she booked it. If the owner tells a customer that they will be the one cutting their hair, they of course still have the right to decide not to, but it's a dick move.\n\nI don't want it to seem like I'm justifying Robin verbally or physically abusing the stylist - there's no excuse for that.

Why would I care if they want their assistant to do it? If the stylist is Picasso for hair, don't you think they'd have a highly skilled apprentice? Do you think the stylist is just gonna walk out of the room and let the assistant do all the work? The stylist is obviously gonna be present and insure the work is up to standards.\n\nThis business is based on results. You get paid *and* tipped after the work is done. Do you think the stylist is willing to jeopardize their income if they weren't confident in their assistant's abilities? Not to mention the job already looks 50% done.\n\nI would never be in this situation because I would trust the opinion of the stylist that I've built rapport with. And if I ended up getting a subpar job, I would tip accordingly and voice my displeasure. I certainly would never get into a verbal or physical altercation with someone I've trusted to do my hair.",

She's paying for a service done by a licensed professional, not a \"trust me bro\" about an assistant with less experience.\n\nRegardless if the payment is done before or after if you're telling me you will provide a professional service I expect you to do it. Not a less experienced assistant you throw me to in the middle of it. That's a complete waste of her time. Not to mention inconsiderate on the stylists part.\n\n>And if I ended up getting a subpar job, I would tip accordingly and voice my displeasure.\n\nBut that's what she did when the stylist said her assistant was gonna do it. Instead of an \"okay that's understandable I'll do it\" she got a power trip \"I'm the boss\" rant.\n\nI really don't know what to say to you if you cannot wrap your head around that.",

From my interpretation of this clip, it seems like the customer was going to be given the employee *when she walked in*. I mean that as in before they sat down and started working they let the customer know that the employee would be doing their hair today, at that point the customers options are again, accept those terms or decide to not give them any money and walk away. Instead I think the customer pressed to have the owner do it, which like before she's not necessarily entitled to. \n\nThe owner in this case agreed to do it for the customer, and from what we can see in this clip, continues to drag the issue out and act as if the owner isn't giving her special service by way of saying \"the customer is always right\", like demanding who serves you is just a a part of the deal. To make a stink while they're working on you *and* disregard the someone going out of their way to accommodate you is disrespectful. \n\nIt's an entirely different scenario if they agreed the owner would do it, and then halfway through she said \"surprise, now the employee will do it\". That's like ordering a burger at McDonald's and being handed an ice cream, it's simply not what was agreed upon. I genuinely don't think that's what they were doing, but if it was they're definitely wrong.",

At this point the owner agreed to do it and *then* put the dye in her hair. The video only picks up when the customer is halfway through getting it done by the owner but is still making a fuss over it, and acting like even though she got specifically catered to, it's no big deal.\n\nIt would really help if this video started earlier because all we can really do is guess.\n\n>No disrespect taken\n\nThanks my dude",

Banks can \"fire\" customers; I've seen it happen more than a few times. One such customer I've seen it happen to was even a rich guy who had a lot in deposits.   \n\n\nWe fired him because he constantly cat called every woman at the bank. These women were like 18-21, and he was around 70. So it was incredibly inappropriate based on that alone. My coworkers thought that because of the status of the client (\"private wealth group\"), the bank would just downplay his actions, and so they didn't even attempt to pursue escalating it. I finally got so tired of it myself (the atmosphere whenever he came in was pure cringe, and he talked loud enough that it made other customers in the building feel uncomfortable) that I called senior management on him myself, since at that point it involved me directly. They fired him that same day, without hesitation. Cut him a check and said \"You can go to XYZ bank down the street and have them deposit this from you. Your accounts here are closed. Have a nice day, sir.\"",

And now, it\u2019s been almost 8 years since he passed, but because she has developed these super snotty habits, it\u2019s like the older she becomes, the more disrespectful she is to anyone around her that dares to \u201cchallenge\u201d her in any way.  \n\nLike this thing with the hairdresser, for example.  My stepmom will schedule an appt with her hair dresser, but then she cancels it last minute- and she\u2019ll do this like 3 to 4 times EVERY MONTH.  So finally, after dealing with her flakiness for like 4 years straight, her hairdresser finally told her that she\u2019s going to start marking her appts as \u201ctentative\u201d and that sometimes she may have to make due with the hairdresser having another client there because she isn\u2019t going to block off solo time for someone who may or may not show up on a regular basis.  \n\nAnd of course this caused my stepmom to go OFF\n\nShe did the whole \u201cafter all the money I pay you\u201d and blah blah blah making herself the victim crap, because this lady has been doing her hair for 20 years and thought that meant she should put up with her bad, selfish behavior and not say anything about it.  \n\nShe couldnt see that this happened because she\u2019s become so damn unreliable, or that the hair dresser has lost tons of money by making appts for her and ending up with empty time, over and over and over again.  All she was telling her was that she may have to share her appt time with someone else BECAUSE of HER inability to keep a damn appt anymore!  \n\nBut in her entitlement, she couldn\u2019t even see that.  And when I tried to explain it to her, she then went off on me too.  Just wtf.  How can you be so into yourself that you can\u2019t even see the world around you?",

      "text": "This reminds me of a time when I was a kid working as a bagger at the grocery store. We had this customer who has been shopping there for more than 30 years. At the time when I started working there there were a few times she came in and became angry and insulting. From what I was told by my coworkers who worked there longer she wasn't always like that. \n\nOne day she came through the line I was working and she got very angry at how I packed her stuff. I was a kid and sure I realized my mistake and I should have put more thought and care when packing her stuff but she completely went off and then that's when she started to make racial comments towards me. \n\nMy supervisor told me to go outside and take a break. \n\nThe next time I saw her I was actually outside pushing carts and there she was sitting on the bench next to the entrance. She was crying. In my mind I felt she's a mean racist old lady. But because she was old I felt sympathy for her too. \n\nI walked up to her and asked her why she was crying and if everything was ok. She had told me she was banned from the store. It turned out she had another incident with one of the cashiers and this time the manager decided to ban her. \n\nThat's when I told her it's not cool to disrespect other people. But her reply hit me hard in the gut. She told me her anger wasn't related to the quality of service but because she lost her husband a month ago. She was angry at life in general. Like a child who doesn't know how to deal with their emotions properly. She was alone and missed him.\n\nShe didn't even recall yelling or saying racist things at me the week before. She was just angry because the one she loved was gone. \n\nYeah, I remember what my coworkers said about her shopping their for 30 years and never had any problems. So I walked into the store informed the manager how she had just lost her husband. \n\nHe and I came out to talk to her and I had never seen a woman sob so much. So much that I started to tear up. \n\nThe manager allowed her to continue shopping at the grocery store and after that everyone in the store and her were ultra friendly towards one another. \n\nI'm glad I had compassion at 15 years old. I don't know what it's like to lose a life partner so I can only imagine how hard it is for a lot of people.",

By the looks of it, Robin was getting highlights so I reckon that would take at minimum 3 to 4 hours. Keep in mind the hair has to be washed, shampooed, dried throughout as well, it takes more stamina than one would think ... to be on your feet for that long, not to mention holding your arms at an angle like that. Sharon the stylist made it pretty clear that the other chick is only gonna be assisting in the highlighting process which is basically applying the product to the hair bit by bit in small slivers of foil ( which takes forever ) - The stylist knows what she is doing, and its not like her apprentice is gonna fuck up as she is quite literally guiding her as they do her hair together. How else are folks supposed to learn and become stylists, if they can't go thru this process? My GF had to, every person in this type of biz has to get their hands dirty at some point - Not to mention, Sharon seemed to imply during this curfuffle that other places didnt want Robin as a customer, so this leads me to believe she is shitty on the regular to service industry workers, or at least the local hair salons.

Robin is definitely wrong, but the owner might be insisting on something that most people wouldn't want either.\n\nThe video made a lot people assume Robin is a racist jerk when maybe she's just a regular jerk.\n\nI know a hairdresser that does insane coloring and charges literally thousands of dollars. If I was paying that stylist hundreds or thousands of dollars to color and cut my hair, I wouldn't be ok with the assistant doing anything other than the wash and dry either. But at the same time, I would hope I wouldn't lose my mind like Robin did.\n\nThe point is that all this is maybe Robin wasn't being racist and had a valid argument until she couldn't control herself and then deserved to be kicked out as opposed to her being ridiculous from every aspect.",

Instead the owner responded with \u2018 Not in my shop.\u2019 That was a terrible reply and this is where it escalated. \nCall her all the names you want. She is paying for a service and likely a premium to have the owner do her hair.  This is where she stops being right. \nNever put your hands in someone!  Honestly at this point I would politely said please just rinse my hair I will come back another time when you have time to do my hair.

Supposedly, she was informed that there would be an assistant, but after watching the stylist's online content, I'm left wondering how much info she actually disclosed to Robin. She is way too thirsty for clout on Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok: https://youtu.be/J7IImAIEL4Y.\n\nI would also be more empathetic to the situation the stylist was in, but the stylist went too far by sensationalizing the entire altercation and further villifying Robin as the \"racist client\" all over social media without any definitive proof of Robin's racism. The video conveniently starts after what should have been some \"racism.\" Just because she wasn't comfortable with the assistant (who's not white) coloring her hair, doesn't mean she's racist.",

Thank God your type (Robin) is dying out and we have a new caliber of business owner (stylist rock star). This is the direction the world is going. A world where we let service workers keep a modicum of dignity. *Please* for the love of God take the Robin and the Karen and the Trump train customers. Make sure you are very clear with your employees that you will always value the customers dollar over their dignity so they can make their employment choices accordingly. There is SO MUCH opportunity for workers. Help wanted everywhere. Let business owners like you and the Robin's of the world have each other. Let employees choose to work for company's that value them or ones that let their customers treat them like dirt. I'll spend my money at rock star stylists business where we treat each other like fucking people of equal standing just paying to get my hair done.

Since this is almost definitely the first time they\u2019ve met, she wouldn\u2019t know that this woman had such an inflated ego, and if she did she would probably kick her out (which she does upon finding out about the inflated ego). I think she could\u2019ve handled it better if she wasn\u2019t so aggressive, i.e. just asking her to stop and leave instead of yelling about how it\u2019s all on camera (which did nothing) but otherwise it was perfectly reasonable to expect respect from a client. It doesn\u2019t matter where in a business people are, it\u2019s still human to human interaction where respect should be a given. Second, dude it\u2019s then. Than requires both things in the comparison present in the sentence. Their statement was an if/then. Like \u201cIf you hire a team etc etc, then you\u2019re projecting\u201d. Not a comparison of two things, just a jump to a conclusion where the original couldn\u2019t even be considered projecting.",

Paying for something does not give you carte blanche to treat others poorly. \n\nThere's a right way to get across your point across without being disrespectful. It sounds like the assistant was standing in the doorway to watch, made Robin uncomfortable, and she reacted poorly in expressing herself. Would make sense for her to say she didn't mean to make her uncomfortable but she has to train her, etc.",

I love to learn and enjoy when others are forced to learn important lessons that make them better than they considered themselves before.",

I wish there was more of the before footage because the first 40 seconds they were laughing, smiling making what sounded like playful banter and then it goes to \u201cI am paying you to do my hair and you are going to do it\u201d and about 15 seconds after that line she lunges at the shopkeep. The shopkeep kept a pretty consistent, sanguine composure throughout but then Robin goes from laughing to assault it\u2019s just a weird change of tone I wonder what she was saying to the assistant.",

I'm a plumber and a similar thing happened to me while I was still working for my dad (I've since gone self employed, I just did my apprenticeship with him and worked with him for a couple of years after while I saved the money to go out on my own).\n\nWe arrive at this customers house, who we've done work for before, this time she had (if I remember correctly) a leaking flush pipe and a tap to change. I get out of the van's passenger seat which is facing the door and as soon as she sees me she says 'where's your dad? Is your dad not coming?', which seemed odd but I just told her he was just on the other side of the van getting out of the drivers seat. We then go in and take a look at the problems. She has a small bowl catching leaks from the flush pipe, it's pretty easy to work out what needs doing so my dad tells her what parts we'll need/what needs to be done. The entire time she keeps telling me not to knock over the bowl and spill the water on the floor. At one point my dad is talking to her in another room and I'm checking something on the flush pipe, when I come back she's just like 'You didn't spill the water on the floor did you' as if 1. I would be stupid enough to do that & 2. If I did I wouldn't clean it up or tell her. So my dad then tells her that he'll head off and get the parts, and leave me to start on dismantling stuff. She suddenly seems incredibly offended and says 'you're not really going to leave him to do it are you?' And my dad sort of laughs and says 'Well yeah that's what he's here for.' She says 'Oh no you can't, you're a much better plumber than he is' (all of this is with me stood next to him but she's just refusing to acknowledge me). My dad tells her that I do know what I'm doing, I'm fully trained, and he wouldn't let me do anything he thinks I can't handle. She then says something about 'well last time you were here he put a valve on wonky' my dad's just like 'what' and she says she'll show us. We go look in the other room where there were 2 pipes we'd installed with an isolation valve on each, and all she meant was that they're staggered by about a couple of millimetres, which doesn't effect the way they work *at all*. At this point we give up and say 'whatever' and go off to get the parts together. While we're in the van my dad says something about what a bitch she was being to me, and then says 'and I'm pretty sure I installed those isolation valves' to which I tell him I'm glad he said that because I thought the same thing but assumed I was misremembering. In the end the woman ended up paying extra because it took us so much longer without her allowing me to do the job I was trained foe and being paid to do.",

Racists work by making people feel small and alone. The only way to combat racism is to stand up and say no, this does not reflect my viewpoints and values.   Putting racism and racists on display is superb in that it turns the table. It make the racist feel the pressure and alienation that they were trying to afflict on others. Most importantly though it lets the victim of the racism know they are not alone.",

If you stay calm, collected, and let the \u201caggressor\u201d have some type of small \u201cvictory\u201d and let them believe that things can still be fine, the odds of successfully calming her down and removing her from the store peacefully go way up.\n\nPlus she was already assaulted. So if you push even harder there\u2019s every chance the aggression continues and escalated to violence again. \n\nThere\u2019s no 100% right or wrong way to handle it, but the way she executed this was excellent. Really good example of how to control a situation that can turn ugly.",

They are used to being in control of everything and being able to leverage their status, position, wealth, rules, etc over others. They have gotten older and still try to control everything and everyone because they are the elder and you should respect your elders. Times up. You are dealing with adults not your children and respect is a two way street. You want it you give it. \n\nI really actually feel sorry for them in a way, so much had changed from when they were born to where they are now. Living through civil rights and segregation, cold war age of technology and they have not learned to change and adapt. Because they haven't had to.",
