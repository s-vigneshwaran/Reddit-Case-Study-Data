  "text": "TIFU by being an unintentional wingman\nAt my gym over the past couple of months I've noticed a cute girl who works out around the same time I do and I was interested in asking her out, but I'm kind of awkward and I don't approach girls in the gym.\n\nA few times I've seen her talk to a guy who she seems to be friends with, I haven't seen anything romantic or flirtatious between them and I was pretty confident they weren't together. So my awkward self decided to talk to the guy and ask him if she was single (very junior high of me I know). He said he had no idea, that they know each other because they used to work together, and have been friends ever since. As he was talking she came walking over to us, and before I could stop him he turned to ask her:\n\n(Paraphrasing what I remember)\n\nHim: hey are you single? Becau-\n\nHer: God it's about time! I have been waiting forever for you to ask me out.\n\nHim: uh...\n\nHer: ...is that not what you were asking?\n\nHim: yeah it is! Are you free Saturday?\n\nHer: absolutely! Text me, I have to get going soon.\n\n\nThroughout this I was just standing there like a third wheel watching like a doofus. After she left he turned to me with an apologetic look on his face and said he'd always had a crush on her but never acted because he didn't want to hurt their friendship if she didn't feel the same way. \n\nI told him I completely understood and was happy for both of them.\n\nAll in all, -1 for me and +2 for them = net gain for love.\n\nTL ; DR\n\nWanted to ask girl out, ended up getting her together with someone else.",

Plus, I hope this gives you time to become more confident with yourself. Speaking from experience, confidence leads to feeling relaxed when meeting new people, making a great first impression and having fun dates. My biggest advice is don\u2019t set any expectation when meeting or dating. As soon as you\u2019re hoping for something it\u2019ll make you nervous. Just go with the flow. When you meet the next girl you have a connection with, ask her out. If she says yes, then plan something fun and enjoy yourself, or just wing it. Good luck!",

If a girl says no thanks, you have two choices: say ok and go about your life. Or, you say OK and just be their friend if you can get past your feelings. Anything else is not being a friend. The friend zone is the are you place yourself in, you make the choice to hold on to feelings in the hope if you wait in line you'll get your chance, and that's a problem of your making. The girl just said no.\n\nNow this is different than a girl leading you on and stringing you out as long as possible, but that's not the friend zone, that's emotional abuse, and not OK. Your best bet is to walk away, it'll suck, but you'll be better off. \n\nBe good my dudes.",

She couldn't accept they stopped working together so she started working out with him as it was a \"coincidence\". She probably wasn't even interested in working out. \n\nShe may be cute, but she's trash in the inside. That other guy will soon realize so and leave her. At that point keep chatting with him, she'll get jealous and try to hook you up, hoping the guy will get jealous aswell. She'll never love you, she's OBSESSED with him. Which means that if you want to bang her, there'll be chance for that too. But remember, she's a bitch and this won't change. She's not the love of your life.\n\nAfter that, the guy who will be pretending to be your friend will just bettay you for her, but that's ok because you have done the same all the time long. They'll break up again, and again, and again. But it will just end when she stops going to the gym.\n\nTL;DR: You didn't actually fuck up, you can still get what you want and have an easy getaway for when you understand how stupid she is",

If she were shy, she wouldn't have said \"you finally asked me\", she would rather have said something else. If she was confident she could just ask first, but she didn't.\nIt's a quite small detail, but she's just playing with him. Unless they live in a small town, the odds they ended up going to the same gym, at the same time, that she's interested in him are quite low. But here we are.\n\nMay it be just a big coincidence? Sure\n\nMay it be she was interested in him since before they met?\nIn this case, wouldn't you be a little concerned about someone pretending it's a coincidence you go to the same gym?\n\nIt would be interesting to know who started working out first, if it happened to be her, I would just admit I'm a paranoid idiot, but I'm pretty sure she just followed him there.",
