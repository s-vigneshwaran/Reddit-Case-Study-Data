I'm just saying that Andrew might have gotten lost where he published his stuff and what licenses he agreed to...\n\nSo... take that with a grain of salt.\n\nEdit: And, he is also selling the 3d model for money: https://www.artstation.com/marketplace/p/BR9a/tiki-drummer-support-the-artist\n\nAnd looking through his downloads there, he is also selling other IP for money. So, there is that....",

I am well aware of parody as a fair use defense to copyright infringement. I reread your comment, and I think I now understand what you meant. I don\u2019t disagree, although I think your comment is ambiguous as written. Mea culpa.\n\n3. Your statement that \u201cstealing a character/idea\u2026 is okay in the art world, as long as you don\u2019t make money from it\u201d is simply not correct. I have no idea to which \u201clawyerly\u201d comment of the 4000+ comments in this thread you are referring, but this assertion is not consistent with the huge judgments levied against people who shared copyrighted material on napster, BitTorrent, etc.\n\n4.

Believe you me, I know I am stupid in a lot of aspects. I never developed good debate/argument skills, so sometimes I say things that I \u201cknow\u201d/believe-to-be-true as if they are definitively true. When what I really mean is \u201cthis is my understanding of it\u201d and I\u2019m open for correction. I am old now, but somehow never learned this skill.\n\n1. I thought I had something good to reply here, but the more I look at it the less confident I am about the nature/purpose stuff. It is not quite what I was thinking. Although him selling it (commercial) still definitely bites him here.  \n\n2. Apologies if my wording is poor. I am but a layman and I\u2019m also on mobile. And I\u2019m also really not great with words. \n\n3. I was referring to fair use in general here. And I agree my wording was definitely too broad. The lawyer comment unfortunately I can\u2019t find, but was more referring to if Disney was culpable in the theft of his infringing artwork. Basically just because he infringed doesn\u2019t necessarily mean Disney gets to steal his work and use it either. \n\n4. Lol thank you, I think he\u2019s pretty awesome too.",

He didn't really \"create\" anything thats intellectually or creatively seperate than the original animitronic. If anything Disney could sue him for releasing their artwork without their permission because of that. \n\nThe only thing he may have been owed if he hadn't released it for commercial use is some sort of compensation for the time he spent creating the model.

      "text": "Ok so, in this case , it's pretty straightforward, I studied image rights when I was doing my masters in fine arts so I'll have a go at this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn EU law (which is thankfully pretty similar to the US) The general rule is as follows: In order for an artwork to be under copyright, so seen as legally original, you have to be able to prove the paternity and originality of the artwork. In this case, the design's paternity isn't the 3D-artists', it's disney's Rolly Crump from 1968.It could be argued that the artwork's originality and paternity reside in it being a 3D-model, but that would never stand in court as the original is already a 3D sculpture, and this 3d model is **not transformative enough to be seen as original.**\n\nI'll go as far and say that freely distributing a model based of someone else's is borderline copyright infringement in the first place. When he says \"I didn't want to bother with selling this\"; it's because he can't in the first place, disney would be up his ass with lawyers.\n\nIs it crummy from Disney not to credit the guy who made the 3d print from an ethical point of view? Yes. Is it legal for them to do so? Also yes.\n\nEdit: A lot of people are saying that disney doesn't have the right to use the product of his labor for commercial purposes, so I looked a little into it, and boy, it's murky waters:\n\nCopyright law also protects reproduction, in this case, I would argue that this is too close to the original art for it not to be considered a reproduction. So in the first place, the artist doesn't have the right to reproduce Rolly's art. Ok, whatever. The interesting thing here is that Disney ended up using artwork that was created in illegal conditions in the first place but whose design was theirs in the beginning. In the case of counterfeit goods, the police would be required by law to destroy all the goods, in this case, the model would be destroyed. I have no idea if Disney can use a counterfeit product of their own product as their own.",

It doesn't matter whether or not he scanned the orignal art or painstakingly recreated it in a 3D modelling program. It is absolutley a copy of the original art. To repeat - a copy. He copied the art. This isn't complicated.\n\nEdited to add: Much of the work on Deviant art and similar websites would easily fall foul of copyright laws. Just because it isn't in the interests of copyright holders to persue claims against such works doesn't mean it's protected in law.\n\nEdited again to add - because this whole thing is really fucking annoying me. These laws exist to protect \"smaller\" artists just as much as \"evil disney\"",

So the source of the 3-D model used to produce this merchandise would have been known.

A Disney artist created this design originally in 1963 a guy named Rolly Crump who this guy gives no credit to. In 2006 Disney made a collectible statue of the Tiki drummer which this guy made a copy of using 3d software and now has the balls to claim the his artistic effort is being exploited. I hate to side with Disney on a trademark matter but this guy is a hippocrite, who took took someone else's work and changed it minutely and claims it as his own.",

Disney could cease and desist him from hosting it in certain places, but they cannot force him to destroy it, they cannot force him to delete the file, and they absolutely cannot take it and sell it without his consent. \n\nIf a painter came to Disneyland and made a realistic painting of the statue, would Disney own that painting? No, they would not. \n\nThe right to copy something (copyright) does not extend to works you did not create or own as intellectual property. Disney owns the IP for the original figure, not the model. \n\nI color comic books for a living - while Machine Gun Kelly owns the IP for the scripts and illustrations for the \"Hotel Diablo\" graphic novel (those artists signed \"for hire\" contracts giving up the IP), MGK does *not* own my colors for the work. \n\nWhile I can't go and sell those colors on their own (they're based on IP that MGK controls), he also can't go around and use my colors for marketing etc. without my permission. Legally, I'm an author of the work - just like OP is legally the author of their work as well.",

Disney's potential claim to have one is likely to be predicated on an agreement with the artist who is currently being credited, rather than the person who made this particular 3d model. At the very minimum, Disney's receipt of (and payment for) labor is predicated on a material falsehood, regardless of where that line of deceit originated. That's what fraud *is*. The only question is what *legal* obligation they have to ensure their own employees aren't defrauding the public from inside, which is basically what happened the moment they published a collectable that, at least in part, derives its value based on the artist, and they credited the wrong one. By failing to ensure against that, they're subject to scrutiny on the basis of negligence, at least. In the book world, a publisher can be sued for that. Same same, just a figurine instead of a book. To draw a parallel, you can always sell a car \"as-is,\" but you can't just NOT verify that it runs and then proceed to sell it under the automatic pretense that it does without legal ramifications when a customer finds out that the motor doesn't even exist. That's more or less what Disney did here. Reasonably? Dunno.",

It\u2019s based on upholding the market value of intellectual property. For example, if you take a DVD copy of *Pirates of the Caribbean*, rip the video stream and upload it to YouTube, you are undermining the market value because people won\u2019t pay money to buy the DVD, rent it from a digital service or pay for the Disney streaming app. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019ve derived benefit financially or not. It does not matter if you give credit to Disney, Johnny Depp, or anybody else. \n\nIn effect this is exactly what this guy is doing. He is taking Disney\u2019s intellectual property, and distributing it for free in a way that undermines Disney\u2019s ability to profit from their own intellectual property. In that way, Disney would be the injured party and they could sue him in order to be \u201cmade hall\u201c. Of course competent attorneys from Disney could prove that he has caused more damage than his entire net worth, which they would never collect, but they can make it a point of imposing extremely damaging financial penalties against him as a means of deterring others. \n\nIn reality, a large corporation picking on a small artist doesn\u2019t go over well in the public, no matter how justified it might be legally, so Disney made the decision to simply leave him alone and use his models to produce merchandise for the park. In other words he got off easy. However, now he is continuing to further damage Disney, and doing so deliberately with the intent to harm them  (called \u201cmalice\u201d in civil law) by publishing videos griping about it. Now this certainly has their attention and they need to mitigate the damage with a clear civil judgment in their favor and punitive damages to the artist that deter anyone else from doing the same thing. \n\nIn plain simple English, he fucked himself.",

One could argue its coincidence due to the nature of how carved wood looks -- honestly would probably be what Disney attorneys would say lol.\n\nI really just wonder why this artist wanted to copy an existing sculpture so directly? All he did was maybe add an extra crack or two, but still copied directly most of the original's. Why not create an original piece inspired by the tiki drummer. Seems strange is all",

Disney sells toys, I can't imagine they'll leave a loophole for digital blueprints. \n\nHe was extremely cocky, or ignorant, in posting his blueprint for distribution. He literally confessed to making an unauthorised reproduction of copyrighted/trademarked/etc. material. \n\nPersonal use is a grey area, by some interpretations ripping your own CDs onto your own PC (yes, I'm that old) is a form of piracy.

It looks legit enough that people have assumed it was from the show so it falls away from parody. Even the idea of Tina doing an awkward twerk seems believable for the character. Odds are the Hulu marketer assumed it was from the show, too.\n\nBottom line, the law seems to stick the content of the gif into the hands of Fox. It's been a legal grey area regarding fan art for years. It's not perfect and certainly could be more logical but I don't know how you'd enforce such a thing. I never even watermarked the gif in the first place for them to know who to ask for credit or permission.\n\nI probably could've condensed this. My bad.",

Obviously they have a right to sell the item if it was made by their designers (or if the guy's fan art was an exact replica but that's unlikely) and they'd have a right to send him a C&D if he was selling it because it's their character and the work isn't transformative enough to warrant fair use. \n\nMy honest guess is the designer who passed the model off as his own didn't tell anyone that's what he did and nobody at Disney thought to check. I would be curious to see if this ever gets up to Disney lawyers and what happens.",

He put in basically zero effort in doing anything transformative that would have given him a legal leg to stand on. This is essentially a case of someone tracing a panel from a comic book or movie and then getting mad when Disney takes that tracing and sells it. If you want protection or compensation, do original work.\n\nReminds me of a kid I was in a history class with last term. He says to me, \"How many words do you have to change before it's not plagiarism anymore?\" I thought it was funny until I realized that he was completely and totally serious. He wanted to know what number per hundred words he would have to change in order to not be plagiarizing this paper he bought for like eighty dollars. I told him it would still be plagiarism if he read the paper once, threw it out, and then re-typed it from memory, using all of the same information and coming to the same conclusions, because it's not his original work in any way. \n\nAnyway, if you ever get out to the Enchanted Tiki Room and look at the drummers, you'll find this guy did an exceptionally good job of knocking them off, and that lack of originality is why he doesn't get any sort of recognition or compensation for this.",

Then was even more gobsmacked.\n\nKnowing what I do now about the specific design of the original, and his 3D design and code or whatever it is someone needs to do/write so that a 3D printer understands how to print it, I wonder if we're all taking his \"they stole my design\" wrong and what he means (but in fairness doesn't state clearly, so the common interpretation we're all making is totally understandable) is that they \"stole\" - or didn't pay him - for his code/design that made their.....hardcopy, for want of a better word, into a printable item.\n\nLike the artists/designers who made the official life size replica figurine for the anniversary had to do a cast of the figure in the Enchanted Tiki Room, turn that into a mould, and make 1000 limited edition resin replicas, and would have got paid for that work, even though they were literally copying the in situ Tiki Room figurine.\n\nSo if Disney had wanted to make little plastic or resin 5\" high minis of their 3' high (or whatever; I'm pulling dimensions out of my hat) drummer in the Tiki Room, they would have had to hire and pay a CAD/Blender/whatever designer to figure out how to make the thing in 3D data that could then be printed. But because some eejit had already done that, their Product Design Manager just went \"sweet, someone already put the work into making a blueprint! I'll just yoink that\".\n\nSo that maybe *that's* all Original Video guy meant - hey, pay me for the work I did converting your 3' high animatronic puppet into a 5\" high printable figurine.\n\nI don't really buy it, because the 50th anniversary limited edition figure was in what, 2007 or something? So if he's claiming they stole his work for something that was made 13 years before he did his design, he really isn't making sense. But I'm just throwing out possible explanations for why the hell he even thinks he has a valid complaint.",

Mickey anywhere has the same recognition. \n\nThe crux of the issue is this: if I were making a Zine, and I put a non-official variant of an image of Mona Lisa on there, nobody\u2019s going to buy the Zine solely because it has Mona Lisa on it. If I put Mickey Mouse on the same Zine, I\u2019m going to see an instant uptick in people picking it up, which is going to coincide to an increase in sales. \n\nIf all I did to gain that increase in sales is re-draw a character owned, created, publicized, and marketed by another company, then I used their work (the time, effort, and money they\u2019ve put into making Mickey a commodity, not the time each of their artists spent drawing him) to make money and they should be compensated for it. \n\nI hate that Disney is what we\u2019re using for an example, though, because they\u2019re the prime abuser of copyright law in the US and it\u2019s much harder to justify paying them back.",

The copyright in such work is independent of, and does not affect or enlarge the scope, duration, ownership, or subsistence of, any copyright protection in the preexisting material.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_work#United_States\n\nBasically, the derivative work would have copyright, insofar as it was different, and the original owner could not just reproduce it (in the absence of a license- it seems in this case he did publish it under a license allowing this).\n\nThis doesn't mean the creator of the derivative work is allowed to do it either, they are not. But just because his work is a copyright infringement, doesn't mean that the original copyright holder can freely use it.\n\nUltimately the default legal position here, is no one has the right to the derivative work, neither party has sufficient rights to reproduce it. Both parties would have to agree for any legal reproduction.\n\nThe question here would be over how substantial the transformation was. \"Mechanical copying\" does not create a derivative work. It's just plain infringement. But I think here that he did it by hand and that it did need a creative/artistic input, and it's not an exact copy, would make it a derivative work rather than just a plain mechanical copy. Both would be infringements of Disney's copyright, the only difference it makes is in the other direction, if Disney also infringed his copyright (again- presuming there wasn't a license, which there was).\n\nCopyright holders don't get automatic rights *to* derivative works, they only have the right to *prevent* derivative works.",

Effort does not equal art.\n\nIt doesn't matter if it took artistic creativity to do it, work is work, you don't get to use someone's work because they used your IP. If someone created a port of an old Nintendo game and put it up for a free download, for example, Nintendo could issue a cease and desist and stop them, or even sue, what they can't do is place that same download on a CD and sell it, they'd have to port it themselves. They own the game but not the modified code, just like Disney owns the design but not the 3D print file. They are two separate things. If I make a cover of a song and even if I make it as close to the original as possible, the writer of the song still can't go and sell my version without permission, because song copyright and master file copyright are different things.\n\n> If I were to take a statue of Mickey Mouse from the Disney gift shop and recreate it in a lab, atom by atom, it would be a monumental task undertaking worthy of praise, but in the end, it would still be a statue of Mickey Mouse, owned by TWDC.\n\nNo, it would simply be a copy of a statue owned by TWDC. Think of it this way, if it were a bronze sculpture and you created a mold that can make those exact sculptures, would they be able to come into your house and take the mold so they can make more of them? The answer is no. The 3D print file is a mold, it's not the copyrighted item itself, but a means of creating it, it holds its own copyright because it itself is not the thing that Disney holds the copyright to.",

Disney *does* hold the copyright to this. It isn't dissimilar enough to be derivative. I will concede that the only possible gray area in this whole mess is that they decided to use OP's model instead of simply issuing a cease and desist. Still, what was OP trying to achieve in the first place? Would anyone argue that they had any right to put it on CC? He should have just made it for fun, posted about it on a hobby board, and put it on a shelf like everyone else. Disney wouldn't have cared. We're ultimately missing the forest for the trees here. These laws exist to protect IP, whether it's Disney or anyone else (including small-time content creators). At the end of the day it's Disney's IP without significant alteration. If I put Harry Potter free online but in Comic Sans, I'm sure  J.K. Rowling could publish a Comic Sans edition without paying me, even if I intentionally took months to highlight and change every text character by hand.",

If you take a photo of a Disney character Disney can't just up and swipe that photo from your Instagram and put it on a poster. \n\nThe issue isn't with the design being derivative or not, the issue is the file he created is not a design at all, it's a piece of code, and code most definitely has copyright of its own, just like photos and songs and texts.",

          "text": "I think you misunderstand what, specifically, is being copyrighted. It's not a question about the copyright of the original Disney statue artwork or any trademarks they may have claimed for it. It is the work that was created wholly as a new work by the OP in a 3D modeling tool. Unless he reproduced it through automated means (3D scanning etc.), he expended creative effort to produce the model and he definitely holds the copyright to that data set which includes all of the polygons that he created and arranged to complete the model. Disney didn't perform that work, didn't retain him to do it as a work for hire, and has no rights to his model file beyond those he chooses to grant. That does not mean he can make and sell prints from it, but it is most definitely his copyrighted model. \n\nAs a thought experiment, suppose he had taken a programming language like Python and written software that very meticulously generated polygons and saved their definitions to a file that resulted in an identical 3D model file. You would never argue that Disney owned the copyright to his Python program, right? So it comes down to tool choice. He chose to use a 3D modeling tool rather than a Python interpreter to create his model file. The result was a new work that was independently created by him and not Disney. Don't confuse his right to hold that copyright on the model with his right to profit from prints made from it. And don't assume Disney has any rights to the model, just because they have a substantially similar piece of art that was created before the model file. That gives them no rights to OP's model file unless he grants them.",

This is a pretty clear cut case in the US.\n\nIn the US any piece of art is considered trademarked by the artist until it is directly lifted by the artist himself.\n\nThis is a huge resell of art without permission of the artist and also plagiarism. Unfortunately, Disney has too much money and would probably win the case with months of legal scuffles and millions of lawyers costs so they would probably settle.\n\nEven if it was a \"Disney\" character, this was a new piece of art and would be considered a \"transformative\" piece because it is an original pose and creation.\n\nBut there is no way that this is not plagiarism. This is illegal anyway you slice it because even if his website let it be used for \"personal use\" this is not personal use this is \"commercial use\" which changes the entire legal case.\n\nEDIT: Also, because Disney is so popular the case would be about the fact that the artist's model was of a popular figure. Like a pop-culture icon. Do you think anyone who paints a pop-culture icon has to give up his/her art to the icon? That would be like if someone painted a young Clint Eastwood in cowboy gear as a nod to westerns suddenly had Clint Eastwood claim that painting as his own and selling it with his signature in mass production.",

So in the first place, the artist doesn't have the right to reproduce Rolly's art. \n\nIt\u2019s different in the US in this case. Disney owns the copyright  therefore they have legal rights to 100% of the proceeds. If he had sold any work, all the proceeds would go to Disney. It is in all conceivable ways the property of Disney to do with as they wish. \n\nIf anything, Disney was avoiding bad PR by leaving this guy alone. They were obviously aware of the ongoing infringement against their copyright, but decided not to do anything about it other than take the model and use it for merchandise in their own parks. He got off really easy, but now he is going out in public and bringing a spotlight on it. This is going to get a lot worse for him now because he actively and knowingly took part in undermining the market value of Disney\u2019s copyright. \n\nAnd from the moment this video was published, any decent attorney could use this video itself as evidence of malice which would only up the steaks and make it worse for him.\n\nHe wouldn\u2019t stand a chance of a Fair Use defense and it would be dismissed outright. He has no other grounds to mount a defense and he couldn\u2019t possibly afford it anyway. \n\nHis best bet will be to accept whatever settlement terms they offer even if it\u2019s very damaging financially. They have him by the nuts basically.",

By his own admission, the guy made a copy of a copy and then made it available for free. A letter from Disney saying, \"Hey, were gonna use your design,\" and putting his name on it would have been nice.  But I suspect that legally they could have drafted a cease and desist to get the design taken down before using it themselves and been legally right, although morally wrong. Then again, everything thing I know about the law came from the type of TV show that would sacrifice authenticity for entertainment.",

The markings all sound like details that don't change the overall impression in a significant way, so I don't think they make his creation an original work of art in the legal sense.\n\nThis assumes swapping out the rectangle for a triangle does not constitute original work. But even then the designer would have to proof that he is the creator of this original work.\n\nStill think it sucks that Disney seemingly straight up clones work from free artists..",

That in turn means what's left is original work of Disney and hence they are free to publish and sell the 3D model as it contains only original works for which they posses the copyright, the rest is works for which no copyright exist, since it's not original work.\n\nAgain, assuming \"different but similar\" does not produce any further original work.\n\nCircling back to the opening of your comment, if you created a drawing of Mickey that does not contain *added original work* of yours, then they are free to sell shirts with your drawing on it, since it only contains copyrighted material of their own.",

It's still his work, whether or not he himself had the right to distribute it in the first place.\n\nYou can't take someone's work and say \"Nah we can do whatever we want with it since he copied it from something we did\". That's not how it works.\n\nBecause of what I signed I can't say much but I've had a similar thing happening to me. I made a 3D model in 2015 of a technological product that wasn't mine. It was a fan made 3D model, and I distributed it under a creative license. Only condition was to be credited if someone else used it.\n\nYou can imagine my surprise when I started watching a new season of a very big TV show and found my model there. I wasn't credited.\n\nI talked to my lawyer and after some back and forth he got me a nice amount of money through a settlement (same settlement stopping me from giving details).\n\nI didn't own the original rights of the object I copied, but I still owned the rights of that 3D copy. I guess the makers of the original product could have sued me (but what for?) but I also clearly had the rights to sue the show for their illegal use of my own model.\n\nEdit: Just to clarify my \"but what for\". In this situation I was providing developers of apps a 3D model of the device they were developing for. The model was shared on the device creator's official forums and they didn't see anything wrong with it since it helped devs and advertised their product. Obviously in other situations the original owners would not be so kind.",

If so, Disney has the right to sue him for infringement and distribution of the 3D print he made. Because this is replication, he does not have a case against them for Disney's use of a replication of a work Disney owns.\n\nIn your situation, you are fortunate your lawyer worked out a settlement. If the issue went to court, and the question of \"who owned the design upon which your model is built\" came into question, you would have found yourself in an uphill battle. If the TV studio contacted the creator of the device, and they authorized the use of its likeness, you would have to answer to the creator for the violation of the copyright in their device's aesthetic design (assuming its not a completely utilitarian product).\n\nThe problem here is replication/duplication. If you were to violate a copyright on Spiderman by drawing a picture of him, then that picture would be both a potential violation, and a new work subject to common law copyright. If you photocopy an existing picture of Spiderman, you have not done any transformative work, and are in clear violation. Whether a violation has actually occurred, or fair use applies, could only be determined in court.\n\nThis statue seems to be a 1:1 replication. The model hasn't been significantly transformed from the work it is based on.\n\nYour situation sounds very similar to the Meshwerks case. See: https://www.filewrapper.com/tenth-circuit-digital-model-of-car-not-separately-copyrightable-because-no-originality/\n\nYou are fortunate your attorney was smarter than theirs.",

But indeed I did not get the rights for it in the first place, considering it was under fair-use (but you can tell me if I was wrong to assume that). It seems to me these difference made the work unique and certainly did not grant the TV show the rights to put it in their show without my permission. The use itself of a representation of the device in the show would probably fall under fair-use too since it was in a parodic setting.\n\nAs for the Disney sculpture, I can see a few differences between the original Disney work and the work done by the guy in question. His version, despite looking a lot like the original, seems to have a lot of unique small details. But maybe that isn't enough.",

One does not need to be a lawyer, to understand juristical texts and how copyright works, on this level  it isn't that complex.  you can literally just google everything a lawyer knows, if you're able to understand the juristical speech and mindset. They just do it, so you don't have to. Ok and you need the lawyer for guesslighting in court.\n\nThe 3D model is his, because he created it. There was none before and he created it on a blank \"sheet\". He didn't change a given 3d model, he created a new digital model based on a real live statue, so he didn't copy it. It would become a little more complicated, if he would have created it for commercial purposes, wich isn't the case. In this case it is *very* obvious that it is his. just like any other fan-art, the artist owns the right on his picture. He didn't make sell it and had not intention to make profit of it. Disney defenetly copied his model on purpose, so they can sell it and make profit. Thus he is right, disney is wrong.\n\nOther Example: I can draw Spongebob taking a hit from the bong, as often as i want and i can give my work as a present to my brother or anybody else, as long as it isn't a commercial use, it is absolutely legal and i do own the rights on Bong-Bob now, because it was *my* work, even though Spongebob already is an existing Trademark. So on the one hand, Nickelodeon would infringe my copyright on Bong-Bob, when they use *my* work to make profit, without asking me if it is ok for them to do so. On the other hand would infringe their copyright, if i use Bong-Bob to make profit, because it is based on their copyright, thus i can't use him commercially.\n\nThe commercial use is the key factor here. \n\nSo yeah, i am 100% confident that i am right, otherwise i wouldn't have said to him to read the discussion below. Just because you don't understand a topic, doesn't mean other's don't understand it. But congratulations, now i explaind it even though i didn't want to.",

You haven\u2019t said the two words that would have at least shown you have a cursory understanding of what is happening: \u201cfair use.\u201d Since you believe google has all the answers to legal questions and you don\u2019t need to be a lawyer or an expert to understand, I encourage you to look into it.\n\nLet me give you an example of why you\u2019re wrong: in 1989, a daycare painted a bunch of Disney characters on its walls. Were they commercially profiting from this? No. But you know what Disney did? They sued the daycare and the daycare had to paint over the characters because they were infringing. You can read more of the background [here](https://apnews.com/article/4d98c8dee1c72fa5ac42ce01dff143fd). Happy to get you further citations for the resolution of this.\n\nSo copyright isn\u2019t about commercial use or profit as you confidently (and incorrectly) assert. It\u2019s about you having exclusive use to depict a character, and while there are exceptions to this that fall under \u201cfair use\u201d, I don\u2019t see how any of them apply here. So the fellow here has infringed the copyright and can have his pants sued off by Disney, which is likely why he isn\u2019t choosing to sue here because he\u2019s going to lose on that claim badly.\n\nNow the more interesting question is if this guy would have a claim for Disney using his work that he infringed upon their copyright with, and that\u2019s the one I\u2019m not certain of because again, I\u2019m not a copyright attorney. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m not confidently stating that I\u2019m certain the guy has no claim. But what I do know is that this long explanation you\u2019ve typed here is confidently incorrect, just as I surmised to begin with.\n\nAgain, my advice to you is to look further into copyright and fair use and again to not try and make assertions about a very complicated area of the law when you are not an expert.

They used the well known Theme, to make the daycare facility more attractive to their clients. Higher attractiveness means more client's, wich means more commercial profit. And popular Disney characters defenetly are a huge selling point, when the targeted custo group, are children\n\nAs i said before, he didn't used it commercially and didn't just copy a character. He created a new model (wich in that form has never existed before) with unique features, even thought these features might be pritty small, it makes it a different character.  It was his work, the digital modelling and it is not okay of Disney, to literally copy his work and using it without asking for a commercial propose. But the absolute copyright no go, is to copy his work and put another ones name as creators on it. \n\n\n\nI might not have used the correct word's, propably because i read the copyright law's a while back and in German. This discussion isn't in my mother language so i'm sorry if i triggered you with that. Anyways, the poor example you chose for displaying fair use, shows that you don't realy have a clue, what you are talking about. If you still don't understand the topic, it's your problem.

That doesn\u2019t give Disney the right to just take his hard work and make money for themselves with it (Creative Commons was NOT for commercial use).

He designed the model, which the model itself is credited for him, but because he didn't want to sell it he put the model up to be freely downloaded. The main thing he's mad about isn't that they used his model, it's that they didn't credit him and that the art director tried to pass it off as his own work.\n\nDisney has a history of doing this, especially more recently with the Star Wars franchise where its been found that for various media the artists been stealing art from deviant art. Most noteably some that aren't even part of the canon so it's really easy to notice that the artists got lazy. While the artists can't do much legally, espeically since it's Disney, it's a horribly shady practice by the artists. So basically it's not Disney they'd take action against if they could, they'd have to sue the artist but Disney would probably give them a top lawyer. It doesn't matter if you're in the right these days, I mean look at Katy Perry. She got sued because one part of a song had a pretty standard musical structure that was similar to another song by a different group. She lost. Despite you not being able to own the rights to basic music theory. But the group got a hack music theory professor to spill some jargon about \"musical degrees of separation\" or something which isn't even real, and the jury bought it up. \n\nSo for artists, copywrite your shit as much as you're able to. Otherwise people can do whatever they want with it",

Just because it has a different scratch or two circles that touch does not count as fair use :P.\n\nYou can't copyright a work that isn't distinct from another existing, copywritten work. In fact, that's kinda the point of copyright as an institution. He made a replica, a straight replica, of an existing statue, then he created a 3D model, which is all fine. Up to this point he hasn't done anything explicitly illegal. Following this though, he copyrighted this model, which very much was illegal. The work already exists, and it's already under copyright. You can't just apply a different copyright to a work that already has one, that's why it exists.\n\nWhether Disney should have credited him or just thrown some cash at him is a different story (although, apparently, he's also selling the same file for money with commercial distribution rights, as well as other people's IP, so idk wtf is going on with this guy). I think, given their $206 billion USD in assets, they probably should have, but they have no legal requirement, even a legal suggestion (which isn't a \"real\" thing but does exist) to do so. \n\nMoral opinions, which I reiterate I share with you, aside, even those Star Wars deviant artists have no case. In fact, they can't actually sue Disney artists for using their art, because Disney owns it as soon as it's made, even if it's made by someone else (Note: Reminding us of the fact that you can sue anyone at any time, but that your case may just be thrown out is not constructive to this conversation). There is such a thing as derivative work but \"Fair Use\" is not law, it's a doctrine, and it has no legal authority. People just agree on it informally but the tenets of Fair Use are not, in their own right, legally enforceable. \n\nYou don't need to copyright everything you do, and that's very expensive (applying for a copyright isn't free). However, if you do something that's not unique, that's not your own, you should accept that it isn't yours.",

But legally, the situation could be similar to Disney hiring an illustrator to draw Mickey. He delivers the drawing, but Disney don't pay and use his art anyway. Disney owns Mickey's copyright, sure, and nobody can use Mickey without their approval. The artist they hired can't use the artwork he created to anything else, but Disney can't use either because they never paid for his work.",

The differences between his model and the original are so small and so insignificant it's very apparent he was making a copy of Disney's work.\n\n> To me, both parties are in the wrong.\n\nI get that it's slimy for Disney to be able to take his work for free.

Often there are key facts that get left out, but even going off the story at face value, all that means is that you have to go through the court process to evict them rather than the cops. So you pay a filing fee of about $86 (which you can charge the person getting evicted, though collecting might not be possible). You get put onto a priority docket for evictions and have a hearing in about 2-3 weeks. After the appeal period of 10 days, the sheriff comes and puts the person out. So maybe about a month of hassle and under $100 spent. If there is a threat to health/safety or accompanying criminal activity it goes faster.\n\nIs that great for the homeowner? No, that's a serious pain in the ass. But it's absolutely not the runaway lawlessness that small landlords love to imply. And it is good to pump the brakes on potentially making someone homeless until a judge (not a cop) reviews the case. It's hard to balance these competing interests, but know that there are a lot of people who do just that and it's not like this has never occurred to them. Word of mouth understanding of the law is never to be trusted.",

It is for that reason that I am fully aware of just how rare a seriously problematic case is. \n\nSquatting is not a serious problem except in the most densely populated urban settings that have vastly expanded tenant protections. If the occupant has no plausible claim to the rights of a tenant, they can and do get thrown out as trespassers under common law. Many of the stories you hear leave out the part that gives the occupant their valid claim. Also common is that the homeowner does not take the steps that the law provides to them to evict the occupant. I have talked with folks who were indignant at needing to go to court and so they simply didn't, instead repeatedly trying to oust the occupant on their own and being thwarted because that route is not available to them.\n\nI think affordable legal advice to homeowners and landlords should be a societal priority because the system can be difficult to navigate without training. Most of the stories come down to an unsophisticated owner failing to use the legal mechanisms to remove the occupant, *not* an occupant being legally insulated from ouster. That is a serious issue that should be addressed.\n\nAnd it can certainly be a costly problem, but so is the other side of the issue when a tenant is illegally evicted. Legal disputes cause huge losses and we should strive to make that not the case if at all possible. But the solution is not to tip the balance wholly in one side or the other's favor, and it seems that generally people do not seem to grasp the reality of most legal schemes.\n\nEdit: rereading my original statement that you replied to, I stated that the cost was under $100. That is strictly true, but you are right that it does not consider other opportunity costs. I wanted to highlight that the legal mechanisms are cheap and straightforward, but it is true that you can lose a lot of money elsewhere as a result, and I should have stayed as much.",

Read together, the two sections make plain that the criteria of copyrightable subject matter stated in section 102 apply with full force to works that are entirely original and to those containing preexisting material. \n\n>Section 103(b) is also intended to define, more sharply and clearly than does section 7 of the present law [section 7 of former title 17], the important interrelationship and correlation between protection of preexisting and of \u201cnew\u201d material in a particular work. The most important point here is one that is commonly misunderstood today: **copyright in a \u201cnew version\u201d covers only the material added by the later author, and has no effect one way or the other on the copyright or public domain status of the preexisting material.**\n\n>The second part of the sentence that makes up section 103(a) deals with the status of a compilation or derivative work unlawfully employing preexisting copyrighted material. In providing that protection does not extend to \u201cany part of the work in which such material has been used unlawfully,\u201d **the bill prevents an infringer from benefiting, through copyright protection, from committing an unlawful act,** but preserves protection for those parts of the work that do not employ the preexisting work. \n\n>Thus, **an unauthorized translation of a novel could not be copyrighted at all**, but the owner of copyright in an anthology of poetry could sue someone who infringed the whole anthology, even though the infringer proves that publication of one of the poems was unauthorized. \n\n>Under this provision, **copyright could be obtained as long as the use of the preexisting work was not \u201cunlawful,\u201d** even though the consent of the copyright owner had not been obtained. \n\n>For instance, the unauthorized reproduction of a work might be \u201clawful\u201d under the doctrine of fair use or an applicable foreign law, and if so the work incorporating it could be copyrighted.\n\nSounds to me like the person who created the model had no right to copyright it in the first place. \n\nAlso sounds to me like you proved my point about you not reading the context or explanation of the laws\n\nSource: https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/103 & https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2011-title17/pdf/USCODE-2011-title17-chap1-sec103.pdf",

So while the \"little guy\" really poses no threat to a trademark owner, the owner has to legally enforce the trademark. \n\nIf I'm mistaken, I'd love to know. I'd hate to go around spreading misinformation. I couldn't find anything myself in a quick search. Hm.

Copyright gives the owner control and ownership of a derivative work *unless* the owner gives/grants the creator the derivative work additional rights. Being transformative is, of course, up to interpretation but the standards vary wildly and there is always a chance you will lose. There is case law on both sides, though the ones that tend to stand out in popular culture (Kookaburra-Men In Hats, Baby Got Back - JoCo, USPS-Korean War Memorial) tend to favor the original artist. USPS-Statue Of Liberty Las Vegas, which could be considered to go the other way is a special case because the reproduction was of a public domain original, which *does* convey authorship to the derivative work. \n\nNote: IANAL, as always get your own council. But, also, I do arranging for several bands/vocal ensembles and have been back and forth with actual lawyers and their representatives about what I can and cannot sell, and just how gray I can get without getting into trouble.",

Creative Commons also means that you cannot profit off the work. \n\nOP does have a leg to stand on; they may not own the character, but they own the model, and him pointing out the similarities was the best way of showing that it was his model.

That you can't use them to sell the things they license is wrong, depending on the license.\n\nThey can actually allow using the work commercially, depending on the license. Here are examples:\n\nCC BY - you can use, edit, remake the original work however you want, as long as you attribute the original other. Commercial distribution is allowed.\n\nCC BY SA - \"share alike\" same as CC BY, however, you need to share/distribute your work that is based on the original in the same manner like the original one, meaning that your work also has a CC BY SA license (but you can still use it commercially if you want to)\n\nCC BY NC - \"non commerical\" now this is the same as CC BY, however, as the name implies, you are not allowed to use your work that was based on the original one commercially.\n\nThere are other licenses (ND and NC-SA) but you get the gist. So in this case it depends on the license the OP made that model available under, Disney could be allowed to sell. There's still the problem, though, that (given of course that OP told us the truth and that model is his original work) Disney violated the license, no matter which CC one OP used, because they didn't attribute correctly, at least not as far as we can tell in the video. That model should have some form or another of \"CC BY OP\".",

(But if they then redesign Elephantman with a new look then they might be good, although I could certainly plausibly argue that Elephantman is now intrinsically based on Rhinoman and maybe we end up going to court over it.)",

Disney of course would argue the 1968 version is original.\n\nAlso I think elsewhere in the thread there is some debate as to whether those differentiators really even constitute a design unique enough to claim any kind of right in the first place. Particularly since he made his design based on a work already owned by Disney and the changes he made and is claiming as \"unique\" are so small that he's having to point them out because a reasonable person would never otherwise notice.",

I assume lawyers would say \"it depends\" but there is some common sense \n\nIf you made a drawing of batman shaking hands with your auto portrait you would effectively create a derivative work, a composition of an existing copyrighted material with the addition of your copyrighted modifications to it. \n\nSince this drawing contains the IP of 2 parties, no one can sell it without the consent of both parties (or the mutual consent between those two parties). \nDisney can't sell an artwork without the consent of an artist or a justification it was a work for hire. \n\nIn real life it really depends on the situation and how the author of the derivative work can prove it is in fact a derivative work. \n\nOld comment : \n\nIt's how this works. Disney own the IP and he owns the copyrights of the statue. He can't sell Disney's IP, Disney can't sell his work.\n\nBut for that he has to prove this statue is his work and his creative process ( I read in another comment his statue is very similar to another one)",

There are any *number* of resources that will tell you that copyright law *is* complicated but in a situation of ripping off someone else's copyright nearly identically, it's not.\n\nI don't recommend you take anyone's advice on reddit about anything related to copyright law. But this situation is really not difficult for you to verify for yourself, instead of fighting about it on reddit.\n\ne: I also want to mention I didn't say which side was right. I just clarified that this isn't a complicated issue.\n\nIt's really hard not to take your post as you getting defensive or something, my dude.",

So he holds no rights to this derivative work. The fact that two of the circles are kinda sorta smushed together in his version would not be substantial enough to give him copyright protections.\n\n(I can give you more links to what constitutes transformative use if you want-- that *can* get complicated.

By that very broad definition Disney own every single photo of a Cosplayer that is dressed as one of their characters, not the model, or the photographer (The artists in this case)   \n\n\nDressed as Superman for Halloween when you were 5? Warner Brothers legally own that photo and can sell it as posters if they want.  \n\n\nIt's nonsense. If you create something you own the copyright on that work (Automatically in the EU, slightly differently in the US). That doesn't mean you can do anything with it, but it means other people can't either. I can draw a picture of Superman. I can't then legally sell it unless I get permission from DC because they own a copyright on the character and a TM on his logo. They can't sell it unless I give them permission",

If the argument being made is that if you draw  a work containing a copyrighted character then it defecto belongs to the copyright holder (the example being a drawing of superman being made) then the same would also apply to a photo containing the same character.  \n\n\nThe argument isn't about wearing a costume, its the depiction of a copyrighted character in a new work",

If it\u2019s probable, then it isn\u2019t original, and does not have copyright.\n\nAnyways, you should always think of the art piece as a whole, what it represents, and such. So it does not require a replica down to the pixel to break copyright, but a much more abstract assessment. Else I could simply draw a line next to a copyright picture and I\u2019d be able to distribute it as I please (which does not make sense)",

But that wouldn't be enough to stop Disney from making a flower stormtrooper, provided it wasn't done in exactly the same way.\n\nIn this particular case, the 3D artist didn't make enough transformative changes to give him any sort of legal standing. I mean, it's a really solid knock-off of the original work in the Enchanted Tiki Room. Unfortunately for him, that means he's really got no more rights to it than I would if I traced a frame from a Disney movie and called it fan art.\n\nIt's like plagiarizing on a college essay: Just because you changed three words in a hundred word paragraph, that doesn't mean you didn't plagiarize it.",

On the other hand, if Disney records me singing \"Let it go\" in the shower and sells it in their stores, I can raise hell.\n\nNow, where it gets interesting in this analogy is if I record myself singing in the shower and post it on my personal blog, with a creative-commons-non-commercial license; then Disney takes my song and sells it. \n\nI argue that there's no way in hell that Disney has the right to do that. You _could_ maybe have an argument that they can send me a letter to take down the song from my blog; maybe they could even try to sue me for damages/copyright infringement (though, good luck with that! [+]).  But, independent of all this, I see no world where Disney can just decide they can take my performance and sell it without my consent.\n\n[+] Their lawsuit would be _severely_ undermined by the fact that they obviously knew about my shower performance (since produced copies that they started selling it in their stores) but were not bothered enough by it to ask me to take it down. I'm not sure exactly how large the damages they could claim would be in this situation, without being laughed at.",

(3d model with added detail that wasn't there in the source material) [This law](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/106) says I need Disney's permission, but doesn't say that the derivative work is Disney's sole property if I don't. However, [this section](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/103) states that the changes belong to the person who changed it, while the original parts are property of the original creator. In this case, that'd mean that the 3d model is subject to two copyright interests: Disney and Video-OP. Disney probably also has trademark rights, but that's beside the point and I think somewhat redundant.\n\nAll of which to say: The 3d model and the derived figures are, assuming we can find changes that video-OP made to the original art in the figures, property of both parties. Neither party can do fuck all with them without the other's consent. Recourse in case either party does anything with that would be, as is usual in copyright, for Disney or video-OP to sue for the other party to stop and pay damages. I don't think Disney can just use it as if it's their own; I don't see that [anywhere in the law](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/chapter-5). They could demand that video-OP destroy it, or could acquire the copyright as part of a settlement, but they don't own the rights to the 3d model.",

Granted, permission is needed, so creating the derivative work is infringement, but absent the law saying the opposite, that derivative work, while infringing, is protected, leading to the \"dual rights\" as I described.\n\nFurthermore:\n\n> The new copyright will not imply any rights in the preexisting material unless permission has been granted to create the derivate work.\n\nThis kind of admits the existence of non-permitted derivative works. I would interpret that to mean that such a work would not touch the original work and its legal status in any way. But absent anything that says \"a derivative work created without permission is not protected\", it's protected, because the law says that derivative works are protected. It says elsewhere in the law that creating derivative works is at the discretion of the original author, but that does not talk about the protection of such derivative works.",

The law calls it infringement, and as remedies for that grants, for example, injunctions and damages. All of those I could see. Everything in US Code Title 17 chapter 5 is fair game, in the ways outline in there. I can't see anywhere that the derivative work is just not protected.\n\nOk, let's create a hypothetical at the other extreme: I create a one-page blurb about a fictional character and their goals and dreams. You create, from that, a 800 page novel about that same character's story. It's clearly the same character, just more fleshed out.\n\nNow. Clearly, I own the one-page blurb. Clearly, your work infringes upon mine and I could sue you to get an injunction and damages - how high those might be, I don't know. But do I just get to yoink your novel and sell it? Is your work really actually not protected at all, except the parts you stole from me directly (which I own), meaning *anyone* can do with those parts as they like? Or is it not more likely that we created a legal clusterfuck where I can stop you from selling my character, and you can stop me from selling your story, and we either have to agree on something or not publish the story?",

He pointed out points of similarity in his video that don't appear on those larger models, so clearly Disney didn't create the model from those.  If he hadn't created the model from scratch then yes, he'd have no ground to stand on here.  That being said, it seems clear to me that he did.  It would also be a different matter if he was selling it, but again, it doesn't seem like he was from the video.  The fact that the two look so similar is a testament to his skill, and the fact that you think that means Disney can download it and mass produce it without giving him credit is a testament to your idiocy.",

Disney will likely work to change the law again to extend it another 50 years or whatever.\n\nEdit - didn't mean to sound argumentative - I misread your post and thought you were making a point you weren't. Your larger point is absolutely right that it isn't the worst thing Mickey lasts forever, but that all of these other works, which nobody even cares about anymore and we can't figure out who owns them, are restricted in the same way as Mickey",

So like when Superman enters the PD you can\u2019t immediately do a Doomsday fan comic because that story line comes much later. \n\nThe scary thing is that no one knows how it will interact with \u201ctrademark\u201d because Disney would claim it has TM Mickey Mouse and those don\u2019t have expiration.",

By convention, big companies tend to leave non commerical fan works alone because they don't want to look bad, fan art trends to amplify marketing, and sometimes provides material for them to leverage in their work.\n\nAs an example, Chrono resurrection is an example of a non commerical fan work that a company shut down.  They made all assets from scratch and were not in a path to sell it, but they got shut down anyway.",

You drew every single bit with your own hand, animated it, and then put it online for free, claiming that it is yours because you put in the work. That would be absurd on its face and Disney would have grounds for filing suit since now people can download an exact replica of their film rather than purchasing it from them. \n\nDerivative works with substantial changes are of course murkier, but being a fan is not a defense either (legally speaking).

But Taking his Digital File and using it without permission is infringing on his work, but again a legal grey area due to the way the law works... Neither is in the right, but Neither can sue. Morals are the only thing at play here, and Disney should Credit his work, but when has Disney's Corporate/Legal cared about morals since Disney himself died.\n\nEdit: A good example is if I sketched a rendition of a copyrighted Character onto paper, that is in a different style or has unique identifiable differences, I would own the Rights to the sketch on that piece of paper but not the rights to what the sketch represents. By the books If the IP owner were to cut out that sketch and use it in their work, they would be infringing on my rendition, but if they traced over it and used it, then they would not be infringing on my physical work. The trouble is translating that to Digital works, which the Laws do not cover properly, and courts haven't completely addressed. Ideally if translated properly one would own the Files and data that is the source of the 2d or 3d Digital object, but not what the 2d/3d digital object represents. If they used his file, they infringed on his work, like cutting out the physical sketch, but if they recreated it, they wouldn't be as if they traced it. The problem for this, is no court will care enough to get into those kind of details to prove one way or the other, as its not as easy as physical objects are. (This is all assuming the copyright isn't directly registered, Like Micky Mouse, which a majority of copyrights aren't. Though in the future that may be changing.)",

As Band B's cover is legally licensed from Band A (even if Band A isn't happy about it), Band B has every right to stop Band A from distributing it.\n\nWithout this rule, the cover would infringe on Band A's copyright and would not be legal as a result. While Band B would normally be entitled to copyright over their music, including any elements not copied from Band A, copyright does not extend to any part of a derivative work that unlawfully uses another work. So if Band B's cover doesn't include elements that aren't using Band A's song, there's nothing they can really claim as theirs, despite it being their own performance. This means Band A would, theoretically, be the sole copyright holder for Band B's cover, as they have the copyright for the song, and Band B isn't entitled to copyright protections for an illegal performance of a song they have no right to.\n\nAuthorship isn't something explicitly governed by US copyright and trademark law. Band B could accuse Band A of \"reverse passing off\", a sort of fraud against Band B's brand. (Normally passing off is taking someone else's mark and putting it your work. Reverse passing off is taking their mark off and putting yours on.) However, the US Supreme Court ruled in [Dastar v. Twentieth Century Fox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dastar_Corp._v._Twentieth_Century_Fox_Film_Corp.) that this protection against \"reverse passing off\" can't be employed to control works you don't have copyright to. Otherwise, it creates a sort of backdoor perpetual copyright, which is outside the scope of what Congress is permitted to do under Article I of the US Constitution (Congress is explicitly authorized to secure the rights of authors and inventors to their works \"for limited Times\"). If you have no copyright over the work, then others can manipulate and transform the work as they like, which includes removing your trademark from it or adding their own to it. It might be a shitty move, but it's not illegal to do so.\n\nAgain, that's all hypothetical though, because cover songs *specifically* are protected by a compulsory licensing system, so in the real world Band B would just step through a couple hoops to have the rights to their own work, they just also have an obligation to pay Band A royalties.",

The 3d Artist holds Copyright over the Digital File and the Model, but not the Character its based on. Just like how Musicians can hold copyright over covers of Copyrighted songs, because it is their creative work based on another's IP, Just like how Digital 2D Artists own the Copyright of the art they create and the files associated with it. They still have to get permission from the IP holder of the character to distribute it, if its not yet Public Domain. (Which this person is technically in breach of)\n\nWhile Disney has the right to the character. They are likely illegally using his Digital File/Model and breaking the Creative Commons License if they just downloaded his model, added the new base and sold it as theirs. Where the Creator loses though is that it would be nigh impossible to prove in court, as the courts are not tech savvy enough to understand this, and Disney has enough lawyers to and money to bankrupt this dude if he tries.\n\nThe only way this guy does not own the Rights to his model is if it was a Digital Scan using 3D Scanning tech and he scanned the original real life object, which he obviously did not. \n\nAlso recent copyright law changes through case precedent has moved towards things must be registered for a company to sue for damages, so if Disney didn't register this random prop from their attractions, then they likely cannot prove damages in court.",

I have made a fan sculpture of Leonardo from Ninja Turtles. Now I cant sell that because I don't hold the copyright to the Turtles design. That's fair and understandable.\n\nBut whoever owns Turtles, can not take my sculpture and mass produce it and sell it without me giving permission or credit. They can however, hire somebody and make the same sculpture, mass produce it and sell it.\n\nPeople seem to think that all this guy did was ctrl+c and ctrl+v and there you go. No he actually sculpted it in a sculping software, looking at references. Therefor he can recognize his own work and it becomes unique because you make unique strokes as an artist. He points that out in the video.\n\nNow he cant sell it because it isn't his design, and that is fair, but the sculpture itself, the 3d model is his, Disney cant (well, they can and did, because its Disney) technically sell his sculpture under another artist name or without asking permission.\n\nIf Disney wanted to do this correctly, they should have hired somebody to sculpt that design in Zbrush, and mass produced that and sell it. Not just take a model they find online and then credit it to another artist.",

As someone else said, it'd be like Disney taken an artist's drawing of some intellectual property they owned, and selling it for themselves. They own the intellectual property. Not the artwork. They own an idea.

So you went and painstakingly reproduced it for you own satisfaction. Spent days or weeks working on it and making it just right.

But the points they're making that you're agreeing he should \"get fucked\" over aren't even the points he's actually making in the video, in which he's in no way claiming it's an original design, he's saying it's his take on the original design of which he took the time to create and upload under creative Commons, then it was taken by one of the richest entities in the world 1:1 with absolutely no changes nor credit.

And your example isn't relevant, here, as it's a different situation.\n\nDisney using this design is the same as sheet music. And, yes, song copyright holders do have partial claim to your cover, as they also own performance rights. Just try throwing a cover version of a song on YouTube, as an example. You'll have to do profit sharing. Now, they can't take your performance and sell it on a CD, as you said, without your approval, either, but that's not what's happening here. They didn't come physically take the model he printed, slap a Disney sticker on it, and sell it.\n\nNo, they can't take a physical thing from you and then turn around and sell it without compensating you. But, you can be sued for the creation of it, in the first place, at minimum being told to cease and decist, and likely being ordered to turn it over, plus punitive damages.\n\nBut again, that's not the point, here. The point is the _design._ A design is purely intellectual property, and is very rightly covered by copyright, and is absolute, and doesn't matter if you do it for profit or not or if you do it for yourself or the public.\n\nGo read this and maybe a couple papers on the subject. The law is clear. This was copyright infringement from the time he duplicated the sculpture.\n\nhttps://www.finnegan.com/en/insights/articles/3d-printing-keeping-it-legal.html",

He defintiely says this in the video but in a way that is a little misleading to be fair. It's a little weird disney didnt make their own model but I don't think this constitutes as art theft in this case. You can see the sculpture in the image you linked is a bit different from his model, which has circles down the arms and legs while the one you linked has a squiggly line. But it's not like he even changed it a lot, it would be one thing if he did the tiki drummer in a different position or something or a drummer inspired by the tiki drummer but this is basically just a copy so it's weird he got mad about it to begin with lol",

But would it still be illegal if his is an exact copy ? The difference I pointed out i have now realized is not in fact a difference, it's an asymmetrical sculpture. His also has a squiggly on the other side. If he made an exact copy of the disney sculpture, how could they even prove they they took his model ? It's hard to see from the original image since it's not 3d whether it has the imperfections he pointed out or not, especially since he conveniently pointed out imperfections on the opposite side. Especially his little connected loops he said were due to laziness, you can see connected loops on the original, albeit the opposite side.",

(Work he OUGHT be paid for). The design/model of that in and of itself belongs to the creator. He may never be able to legally sell it himself because Disney would strike him with a copy violation suit. But that doesn't mean Disney can take his work and just use it for themselves. \n\nThey need to either compensate him in some way, or spend the money to pay someone to design a fresh model. \n\nThe reason he circled the specific parts on the model show that this wasn't done. They instead, undoubtedly, took his work, and slapped their name on it.",

If it ends up being Disney, that's not telling anyone their own opinion of them, only what will most likely happen if it reaches court.\n\nPersonally I don't know jack shit on this topic because copyright laws are their own set of headaches.",

You can compare that side to here https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3778083 where there's a bigger picture - for one, the head on the side of the drum has three cracks/scratches in the middle of the mouth, and one to the left of those three. The 3D model does not have that extra one to the left.\n\nI don't think the issue is that he's claiming that he created a derivative work, or at least that's not the impression I got. He clearly doesn't think he can sell it, it's not his own creation, it's Disney's IP.\n\nThe issue is more that can Disney just use his 3D model without permission? Obviously they own the IP and the inspiration behind the 3D model, but I for one don't know enough about copyright law to say whether they can just take his 3D model and use it willy-nilly.",

You want to progress this character to have a second sword... but wait! Some fan already drew your character with a second version of the sword. Copyright will protect you since his work wasn't derivative enough. The same will be applied here. This dude essentially took a Disney design, added his own \"watermarks\" and then Disney used it.

Imagine them doing that with physical art and not digital. Like, someone makes a replica of the castle in the Magic Kingdom at Disney World as a play house for their kids and Disney just comes and takes it so they can sell it.",

The guy in the video didn't credit anyone for his design which he copied from the original Tiki design from 1964 even if his is a 3d render. The guy who works for Disney didn't credit OP for that design (which is already a copy). \n\nIssue is, Disney worker doesn't need to credit OP for this, as it's Disney's work regardless. The character is owned by Disney. Even if that worker took OPs exact design, Disney can sell it as OP copied what is already not theirs and is Disney's work to begin with. \n\n\nIt's like if you made a \"remix\" of a Beyonce song by just extending the intro and adding or removing some basslines. Than you distribute that remix for free (which how else would you because you can't sell Beyonce's work without permission) but put a fair use notice on it (again, you have no right to do that as it was never your original work even with edits). \n\nBeyonce's agency took that remix and released it as a 2022 Edit and is selling it. Her label wouldn't be in the wrong because it's 99% their work to begin with, and you have no right over the 1% of changes you made on their original work even if you released it for free.",

You actually have less right to recreate their image, than they do for selling your art of their likeness.\n\n>Can they right click and print the image to sell in their shop?\n\nIf we are looking at this particular situation, yes. It's one thing if it's a parody or clearly a different character with inspiration from their likeness, but this is a near identical copy of Disney's IP. Helps that he made the model available for anyone to use, which works in Disney's favor as you can't just distribute their IP (even if you made slight edits and gave it away for free).\n\nHe is disingenuous as well since he states he made it available for free just because (as if out of the goodness of his heart) when he knows he can't sell their IP without their permission.\n\n>The answer is no, they don't.\n\nFalse. You need to read up on copyright law, fair use and creative commons.\n\n>They can legally stop me from selling posters and shirts yeah. They can stop me from copywriting the character easy. They do not own my drawing to sell.\n\nYou don't understand. They do not have to own your specific drawing. You are using their IP without their permission. You are wrong for using their IP, they aren't wrong for taking your image which is a copy of their IP. Anything done with their IP (within copyright laws) is their right to alter and sell as they please, which is exactly what they did. \n\nThe point isn't to defend Disney who has money, it's defending all IP copying. Regardless of if its a big corporation or individual. He wouldn't like it if he made a character for someone else to copy, give away prints for free, than that person who copied his work complained when he takes their copy of his IP and sells / monetizes it.",

Using Op\u2019s as reference is the most likely scenario here. Which isn\u2019t illegal or immoral. Have you looked at the video? He took 3 key identifiers that were the same and focused on those. The wood grain and small detailing are pretty different between the two. Which is making me think that either they are completely different modes, or if they have used OP\u2019s detailing has been lost/changed in retopology etc. \n\nI\u2019m not saying that\u2019s exactly what happened, i\u2019m painting a picture that OP isn\u2019t the poor tortured artist he is making himself out to be. Literally yes, they could have bought the rights to the model. It would be cheaper to buy OP\u2019s model for $5 (again i\u2019m quoting comments here) than pay an artist to replicate it and on top of that sue OP. The Story of a big cooperation like Disney stealing Artwork is a much more attractive story than them buying the rights to use fan art in production because the Artist put it up for stupidly cheap. Also the fact he never mentioned in this video that he in fact did put the model and all it\u2019s right up for sale and didn\u2019t mention it in the video should be ringing alarm bells. Guy fucked up and is wanting the money/attention as compensation. \n\nAlso worth it to look at OP\u2019s status. He has a \u201cbig\u201d instagram following but that\u2019s about it. I think it\u2019s way more likely OP wanted the fame and thought this was his big break. Way more likely a \u201cprofessional\u201d that doesn\u2019t work in industry would fabricate this situation rather than a senior artist with 14+ years experience committing fraud. Artist Delusion is real, he probably believes it himself. No linkedin, no online presence outside of \u201cmonstercaesarstudios\u201d. Shady. \n\nYou believe it because you want to believe it.",

Though it would probably be best to look at copyright law and fair use.\n\nTLDR: sharing is very likely illegal, though companies do not care a lot about free stuff. It also depends on the country, so a general answer is difficult.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCopyright law is almost the same in the whole world ( at least most western countries) and can be summarized to this: If you don't own the copyright and you don't have official permission, then you can do nothing with it. Not even a painting for yourself (though nobody would care about that).\n\nMost fanart is tolerated by companies though, as it really doesn't create any damages most of the time.\n\nFair use on the other hand gives you some rules that allow you to infringe copyright without punishment. Most important for fanart are probably:\n\n\\- is it free or comercial?\n\n\\- is it transformative enough\n\nI would guess, creating a picture depicting a scene eg. Goku blasting a Transformer with a Kame-hame-ha is tranformative enough. Just goku himself might not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFair use is also something specific to the US. Other countries either have no equivalent or something similar.\n\nLet's take nintendo as an example. They legally and consistently crack down people creating fanart/fangames even if they are free. And nintendo wins every single time. Mostly because japan (afaik) does NOT have anything like fair use.\n\nAnother example is Games Workshop, which does the same with STL files that are too close to the orginal GW models. No matter if they are free or cost money.",

I have no idea how the medium used works with \"transformative enough\" - obviously if the original is a painting and you create a new painting that is a very close copy, that is not transformative.\n\nBut what if the old version was a sculpture, and the new copy of it is a 3D model? It's essentially the same thing... but it's also not.\n\nOn the other hand, assuming it was illegal for the original creator to even create, does that make it ok for Disney to use their files? It's not a 1-to-1 copy, there's clearly some changes done by Disney, but it looks like they definitely could have used the 3D model as a base and modified it a bit from there (different wood grain, hands in different positions), so while it again probably doesn't count as \"transformative enough\", can Disney do what they want with it since the 3D model by OP was illegal?",

He doesn\u2019t have any rights to the underlying IP and can\u2019t confer those unto anyone else since he doesn\u2019t have them himself, but there are potentially a more limited set of authorship rights associated specifically with his derivative work, and he can do with those as he sees fit. It\u2019s kind of a corner case, but there are circumstances where it might end up mattering (e.g. in the years between the original IP passing into the public domain and this specific derivative work doing so). So I would say that his decision to release his rights under a CC license has standing, but him releasing those rights does not make it legally permissible for people to violate the rights of the IP holder by making use of his model.",

The guy made a digital 3D model from scratch. Very probably based on images of a physical model.\n\nI guess what I'm asking is what constitutes to what extent something is identical? At which level are we talking here?\n\nIt's not the same medium, so anything that could constitute a measurable data point for this \"object\" would not only have a different value, it would be *essentially* different. I.e. a vertex vs. a physical piece of wood.\n\nIf we look at an attribute like color, even if we could have identified an identical spot on the two objects, we really have no way of comparing color in the two mediums.\n\n(Which makes me wonder how, if at all, someone can legally define something as an object, given that you, in the digital realm, can separate attributes from one another, and have some be identical to another object, and others not.)\n\nIn short, what I'm getting at is that literally nothing in his model is copied from the Disney attraction, even though the object superficially looks like the original.\n\nThere must be some sort of legal definition regarding how one should determine whether or not something is identical, based on some sort of category system and scale. Otherwise it would be entirely impossible to prove something was a copy (because, technically, nothing is identical.)",

Most of their copyright would have entered public domain decades ago, but everytime it was about to happen it gets extended... The system is fucked.",

The guy in the video isn't being sued, so he really should be keeping quiet.

The point being, artists are paid for their work not through royalty but through salary in order for Disney to have full property of the pieces. \n\nThis is a case of someone making a fan-sculpt, but there are his own flairs and he did still SPEND THE TIME AND HAVE THE SKILL to make this figure. 3D modeling is not the easiest profession to pick up, and point being Disney very obviously took his OBJ file that he posted under free non-commercial use. \n\nHe still has rights to a fan created piece, to the point that a corporation shouldn\u2019t have the right to literally just take his file and make thousands (or hundreds of thousands) off of it with no compensation. Y\u2019all act like he just made it in 2 seconds but people are PAID to do exactly what he does, it\u2019s a job. There should at least be property rights that Disney has to strike a deal with him to use it, even if it is fan created, because otherwise where does the limit stop with artist exploitation.\n\nThis kind of shit takes time and passion to create, and having a corporation blatantly taking your file with no permission to sale is already disheartening enough, but to have y\u2019all completely trash on a guy for creating a fan art that HE EVEN RELEASED FOR FREE SO YOU COULD MAKE YOUR OWN (with the agreement being you can\u2019t resale his sculpt) is extra nasty to see. I know there\u2019s law loopholes that allow Disney to use this legally, but that doesn\u2019t make it a good thing to support when it allows them to take it and not even let the guy know they\u2019re using his sculpt let alone not even give him credit for it.",

If you really think about it copyright is put into place so the original creators can own that piece of art and do with it as they wish.

It only prevents others who did no contributions or effort in creating it from profiting from it.

Why does an author need to profit in the grave? \n\nThe only reason it's this long is because of Disney. They always lobby congress to make changes whenever the copyright for their oldest works is about to expire. A ton of their movies are based off of works they didn't come up with. They turned around and said that those movies they stole are now locked up for 100+ years.\n\nUb Iwerks made steamboat Willie in 1928 when he was 27. He lived for another 50 years, and when he died, people were still not free to use his work. It's been 94 years and the copyright still has not expired. Why?\n\nHow does Disney still have a sole right to profit or even distribute a work from 1928? Why shouldn't copyright last forever at this point? So Ub Iwerks' skeleton can make as much money as possible?\n\nFuck Disney. They are a company that spits in the face of creativity, and artist integrity.",

Technically if they copied it, it would be perfectly within the law.

In your bottom paragraph hypothesis, you're not mentioning \"copying\" or heavily basing the paintings off of preexisting art. If you were to make something wholly original then DC or Disney selling that fan art would be way more malicious.\n\nHowever, with this particular piece, he's imitated the likeness of something preexisting but with a few changes here and there. If he however made something heavily inspired by the original, that'd be a different story.",

Which in turn will just make them focus on the issue more. And to uphold their reputation, they most likely will sue for defimation alongside plagerism.",

An artist creates something, (yes, that includes copyrighted work, shocking right?) Then could present it as fan art, or in many cases present it to the company as work for them to sell. In this case, this was just fan art. He's stated he's sold works to Disney in the past too.\n\nBut since HE created this exact model of a Disney asset, (even is fairly close to the original thing) he is the artist that created this model. In the second video he made, he shows another artists claimed they made this model on the bottom. He isn't even credited for his work on this thing.",

Submit some designs to me for my signature series.\u201d and gets a bunch of designs for them.\n\n\n\n-\tSome junior designer sees this 3D file, doesn\u2019t understand the details of the creative common release and submits it to Costa.\n\n\n\n-\tIt gets approved.\n\n\n\n-\tLater, some junior on the legal team sees the reference used and also doesn\u2019t understand the details of this particular Creative Commons and signs off on it.\n\n\n\n-\tIt goes to production and they\u2019re in violation of the Creative Commons.\n\nWhy do I think this? Because I\u2019ve done freelance work for big companies like this in the past (Lucasfilms\u2026now owned by Disney). They DO make you submit references you\u2019ve used in an art piece so they can approve it. So either someone misinterpreted the Creative Commons or they decided using this piece was somehow not in violation of copyright (you\u2019ll need some lawyers involved to get down to the actual facts on that there). \n\nRegardless, I think it was a mistake on Disney\u2019s part but probably not intentional.",

They can say \"Hey, nice drawing. We will create a new one using your design\", but they cannot trace my drawing and say it's original.\n\nYes, he created a model based on Disney's model, HOWEVER Disney is literally taking his recreation and selling it. They didn't create a new piece using his design, they are directly selling his piece.\n\nThe lack of respect for artists, and the shilling of a megacorp is hideous.\n\n----------\n\nEdit: I am not a lawyer.\n\nFrom what I understand, there's copyright and then there's derivative work. Disney has the rights to the original work, and in essence any derivative work can be ceased by Disney and their lawyers. However, the person making derivative work also has the rights to the derivate work since he made it, and so that person cannot make profit off of it. Meaning, what Disney should do is first and foremost send their lawyers to the guy who created that model, tell him he cannot do that, and end the case, then recreated using his work and simply stated this is derivative based off his derivative, which they original owned.\n\nImagine I do a remake of Castlevania. Konami cannot simply get up and sell that remake for profits. Konami can however send me C&D that I cannot host the remake anywhere because they planned to remake it themselves and it's their intellectual property. Then they can go ahead and do their remake, even if that remake is created by looking at my homework.\n\nDisney needed to have a talk with the one stealing their original work, and they also needed to have a talk with him if they plan on stealing his recreation. It is a two way street, and it's why a lot of remakes or remixes get C&D before they get released (or taken down soon after release).\n\nNo one wants to mess with the slippery slope of copyright / derivative. Will the remodeller have a case in court? Fuck no. Don't think he is even considered pursuing a billion dollar corporation. However, it's a common courtesy to send your lawyers and tell him that they've made a new asset using their existing asset, so now they have the right to recreate a new asset using the remake.\n\nAgain, I am not a lawyer, but I have seen quite a few takedowns by megacorps to protect their property, though when they decide to sell the remake, it's best to discuss and compensate (even if it's pennies), to avoid any legal recourse. I cannot sell my drawing of Mickey Mouse, I can give it away for free. However if Disney likes my drawing so much that they see $$$$, it's best to tell me \"Here's $1000, we own your drawing now, take it or leave it, else we are recreating a derivative by stealing yours.\"\n\nIf I do a faithful remix/cover of \"Hakuna Matata\", Disney cannot simply take that remix/cover and sell it in their store. They can however say \"You can't release this cover, it's our song, and because we plan to do a cover that sounds similar to, if not EXACTLY, as yours.\"\n\nAgain, I am not a lawyer.",

I think if there was let's say a canvas art piece with Mickey mouse and the entire background and scenery was original art came straight from the artist mind and created a completely original world nothing like Disney.

I think it has to have significant artist influence in the artwork and be and be majority or close to majority the focus of the artwork. In this case we are talking extremely minor artist influence. I mean where do you draw the line? If a artist takes a Mickey mouse painting and  draws a tiny line at the bottom does that mean the company can't use it?",

          "text": "A few people are supporting the guy who claims that Disney stole his artwork, in the defense of artist being allowed to create derivative fanart of work they respect. You made a very passionate plea for artists so I want to use your comment to explain what this guy did. He made a 3D scan of someone elses artwork, and perhaps touched it up a little and then forwarded it as his own work. Here is his store where he is selling them. https://www.artstation.com/marketplace/p/BR9a/tiki-drummer-support-the-artist Now, if you had created a beloved icon of art or culture and someone else stole it and started selling it, you'd be pissed. But, even if he was just giving this away he still doesn't own the original design. A Disney artist created this design originally in 1963 a guy named Rolly Crump who this guy gives no credit to. In 2006 Disney made a collectible statue of the Tiki drummer which this guy made a copy of using 3d software and now has the balls to claim the his artistic effort is being exploited. I hate to side with Disney on a trademark matter but this guy is a hippocrite, who took took someone else's work and changed it minutely and claims it as his own. He DID prove that Disney probably used his 3D scan to recreate their Tiki Drummer for the new statue. It's not something Disney should be proud of but I guess they searched for and found a pretty good 3D model of THEIR artwork and so they used it. All he really did was 3D scanned someone else's artwork and perhaps touched it up a little. It's not even fanart. It's art theft. I suspect the reason the two rings are linked is just an artifact of 3d scanning. The fact that he points this out as evidence and says that he couldn't \"be bothered' to fix that bit is pretty damning evidence that he just 3D scanned a model. There is a fair bit of evidence that this guy did not create an original 3D model that I suspect will come to light. Like you, I support artists and I believe that Fanart is a great expression and addition to work that fans and artists respect. And that so often creatives do not get the recognition or renumeration, that they deserve. This guy is out of line, I just hope to show you that.",

I understand your point morally on Disney side. But two questions... What artistic influence or originality did he actually impart on this art piece? Can you identify anything significant? Also 2nd question is just using your own ideology against you. Don't you think it is equally as wrong for the artist to completely take Disney artwork and only make extremely minor and really unartistic changes and then post to public as if something he created. I think that's pretty lame too and even worse he mad at Disney now.",

If this model wasn't sitting there for Disney to steal, they would have had to pay someone a bunch of money to make one.\n\nThe absolute minimum would have been to reach out to him and say \"hey, we totally want to use this thing - you want to have your name on the bottom?\"\n\nThis would have cost Disney $0, and could have been a fun little easter egg for everyone involved.\n\nInstead, Disney not only took it and used it without communicating what they were doing, but then misattributed a different artist (not the original sculptor from 1968, but the \"artist\" who literally just stole the model and had it printed).\n\nThat's really really really messed up, regardless of legality - because its literally an artist who didn't do work taking credit for multiple other people's work (the original sculptor from 1968 and this fan).\n\nI don't know if this is legal or not.\n\nMy guess is that its a grey area, and Disney knows that simply telling the fan artist they are going to use it exposes them to some level of liability (even if small), whereas if they just stole it and never told him, he'd probably never find out.\n\nThat doesn't mean his case would have merit btw - but if he could file a suit and Disney was obliged to spend $15,000 getting it dismissed, it's probably better to just not tell him and hope for the best.\n\nBut again, it's not about the law - it's about ethics. Stealing his model and using it without telling him is wrong, regardless of whether it is legal or not.\n\nOur line, as consumers, should never be whether what a company did was technically legal or not. Our line should be whether what they did was right or wrong. This is especially the case when you are talking about a company with a very messed up history in terms of how it treats its artists.",

Even if Disney got it 5th-hand, I would think they would put some effort into figuring out where it came from so they could credit. I'm assuming some level of basic integrity on the part of the artist who went and threw his name on there, claiming it as his own. Also, this artist literally faced a situation where they were like \"either we hire someone to convert this thing to a 3D file, or we use this random file we found\" - there is no ethical person that can have that conversation and not feel icky about just taking it and slapping their own name on it.\n\nMaybe this isn't a perfect analogy, but I think of it like this. Let's say your professor wants you to turn in a paper you previously submitted, but with a bunch of work done to rebuild the citations to comply with a particular format so it can be submitted to a journal or whatever.\n\nUnbeknownst to you, your paper has been shared around some other departments already (yay!) and somebody already reformatted it into a PDF with the new citation format.\n\nYou stumble upon this version of your paper, and go \"awesome - thanks for saving me the time\" and submit it as is to the professor.\n\nEven if you found that PDF on the most random place on the internet, you'd make some effort to communicate with the person who did that work for you, I would think.",

They could have just found it asked the person who posted it if they can use it and they said yes I'm the artist feel free and he'll could have gotten $20,000 for it. Or they could have just taken because legally they can and it is just 1 character of the 1,000s they are doing so I wouldn't expect a full investigation for every little thing with Disney especially when they have no legal right too.",

Coins are means of exchange just like fiat currencies, so I agree with everything you said there.\n\nBut tokens on the other hand.... They represent an actual ownership of something like digital or physical goods. So a company can now use crypto tokens instead of issuing shares. This simple fact changes everything. I was working with major tech companies and saw thousands of startups fail, simply because they couldn't raise funds and compete with the too big to fail bs corporations.\n\nNow you can use your tokens instead of shares, to give your loyal customers, who actually get voting rights and can make decisions in your company.\n\nSo if you are being a poo poo head like mister Zuckerberg and you only care about $ signs and don't give a fuck about your customers, they can, and will destroy you.\n\nCall it socialism, call it true democracy, call it capitalism with extra steps.... It doesn't matter. We call it Blockchain  ecosystems.",

You could launch your own token and make a game to have your own ecosystem within a month. If you tried to launch a company with shares....it'll take you a lot of time and a butt load of money.\n\nThis simply means that regular people can now have access to an easy way of raising funds for their projects.

But it doesn't really show anything different from your explanation then cash and stocks.. You say regular people can start a token and raise funding which is true but why would someone buy your coin? And if they are willing to buy your coin why wouldn't those same people buy shares in your stock.Anyone now can create a gofundme or multiple other avenues with nothing to their name and raise funds if people want to give them money. Wall Street has nothing to do with funding at all. Actually crypto literally has only made Walls Street bigger because all it is one big stock market. The point is if you want to prove how crypto is better you have to be able to explain the minor details and give the real life benefits that will make people want to change.",

That's how we can all learn together.\n\nSo the main difference between raising funds through fiat and crypto, is that fiat currencies are total bs. They have no real value. With crypto tokens, people have a % representation of ownership in the company/ecosystem. You actually own that, and you have voting rights.\n\nWhen you buy a share with a broker like robin hood, you don't actually own anything.",

They may own the character but they don't own that *specific* depiction.\n\nTechnically Disney could have sued him for distributing the STL file, but they cannot use the STL file without his permission.  And his permission was given via the creative commons license... but only for non-commercial purposes.",

Expect a settlement or make a move to collaborate. \n\nTeddy Fresh had a t-shirt they were about to release that was found to be an exact copy of a design in a 1990s knitting magazine \"created\" by an employee who no longer worked for them. They reached out to the designer of it to admit fault and make sure he was alright if they gave him a cut after it was released. They moved on to working with him now on several shirt designs and got him his rightful cut. \n\nDisney would probably not do this, but there is definitely a case to be made IMO.",

Big company then officially proclaims, \"This is our employee's fan art!\" and sells this item as their employee's fan art.\n\nAre there any legal repercussions for that employee specifically, regardless of big company & character? Are there legal precedents for an artist stealing someone else's fanart and having sold it in an official capacity? And if so, what would be the ramifications for the big company?

A fan (Pickett) made a guitar in the shape of the Symbol, hoping that Prince would buy it.  Prince declined, but had a similar guitar made by someone else.  Pickett sued Prince for copyright infringement for \"stealing\" his Symbol-themed guitar.  \n\n\nThe courts rightfully smacked Pickett's peepee.  The decision was that Pickett's guitar was an unauthorized derivative work, made without the permission of the copyright holder (Prince).  As such, Pickett had no enforceable rights in the guitar, and had no basis on which to sue Prince.  \n\n\nSame thing with this story - without permission from the copyright holder, the guy makes an unauthorized derivative work.  As a result, he has no copyright in the work to sell, license, give away, or sue over.",

This is an asset that takes the time to put a design into a certain medium, a creation of something from nothing. If Disney wanted a tiki commemorative statue, it stands reason that something would need to be created from scratch to fit the existing design into the medium of the statue. In this case Disney (or the artist, or the artist the artist hired) used an asset for profit that they did not detail compensation or legal terms for. It would be like if someone made a fanart poster of Frozen, and that gets put on a t-shirt and sold at Disney parks without the artist knowing, and someone else got credit. It's weird, and although it won't build a nest egg, I think he has some recourse.",

Under Section 106 of the Copyright Act, one of the exclusive rights owned by the copyright holder is the right \"to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work.\" (17 U.S.C \u00a7 106(2))  \n\n\nThe GITV created a derivative work based on the statue in the Tiki room, and he did it without permission of the copyright holder.  Therefore, he has \\*no\\* rights in his creation, and has nothing to sell, license, or release under a Creative Commons license.  He can't even donate his work for free to the public domain.  \n\n\nLook up \"*Pickett v. Prince*\", as it deals with the same issue.  A guitar maker (Pickett) made a guitar based on the musician Prince's famous (and copyrighted) \"Symbol,\" without Prince's permission.  Pickett then tried to sue Prince when Prince had another guitar made that was also based on the Symbol.  The court ruled that because Pickett created a derivative work without the copyright holder's permission, he had no rights in his creation and therefore couldn't sue Prince for \"copying\" his guitar.  \n\n\nThe difference in your song recording example is that in order to make a cover version of a song that someone else wrote, you first have to obtain a license to do so from the copyright holder.  So you're still making a \"derivative work,\" but you're doing it *with the copyright holder's permission* via the license you obtained.  Since it's now an authorized derivative work, you have rights in your version of the song and can copy/distribute/license it.",

You are literally working for free, handing them all your ideas and if you make a stink about it they will sue you for copyright infringement. Make your own work or don\u2019t share your fanart online if you don\u2019t want it used without your permission cuz it\u2019s literally their property. EDIT: Sorry to be course but every one gave me shit like I was the bad guy when I warned them this does and will happen.",
