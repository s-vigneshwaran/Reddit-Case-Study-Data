Hell, it\u2019s 2021 and Blacks in America still suffer bs notions that they feel pain less than Whites and study after study prove they are routinely under-prescribed meds, especially painkillers. These notions are legacies of the slave days and more recently the Jim Crow area. \n\nThat said, I can see how doctors could err on the side of caution and just be complete asses about it, unintentionally or otherwise. I can only say this because I had a guy who over the course of 3 marriages had a vasectomy, a reversal, then another vasectomy. I still remember him describing the physical pain as well as the emotional pain and him wishing he\u2019d left well enough alone. I think it\u2019s important to keep in mind, in this case, that doctors have professional experience and access to legitimate medical research looking at the causes and effects of tubals and reversals that inform their thinking. What they lack is training on how to not be asses about it. \n\nI think, though, attitudes suffered by OP and others will not be acceptable in 10-20 years.",

My fianc\u00e9 planned on coming to the surgery just as support and to bring me home afterwards. When my doctor spoke to him they made sure it was okay with him that it might affect fertility. At first he took it just as a heads up about the possibility and responded politely, but then the doctor actually said \u201care you sure you want to sign off on this?\u201d I could tell he was uncomfortable about the doc talking about it like I wasn\u2019t even there, but instead of calling him out directly he got very serious, and asked \u201cwhy would I want to risk her dying of cancer?\u201d Doctor started to answer about the fertility issue again, but he stopped him in the middle of the sentence and said \u201cI\u2019m marrying her because I want her to be my wife not because I want her to be my walking incubator.\u201d I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever loved him more than I did in that moment.

Don\u2019t continue if you haven\u2019t heard of her before and don\u2019t want to be outraged. \n\n\nShe and her husband were paramedics and were both against continuing life support in the event of brain death. She was 14 weeks pregnant when she suffered a pulmonary embolism. She was blue on the kitchen floor by the time her husband awoke to find her missing from bed. But because he started cpr immediately they were able to get her successfully put her on life support machines. But when was it was clear she was gone, he and her parents agreed that she would have wanted the machines turned off. The hospital refused because she hadn\u2019t specifically written down that she would want to discontinue life support even if pregnant. It was taken to court. The court agreed with the hospital that they should use her dead body as an incubator to see if they could grow the fetus until viable. Several months and several court dates later the husbands legal team got the hospital to do enough scans to show the fetus was not developing properly and would not be compatible with life(they really pushed back on having to do the scans that would prove this). \n\nAnyways the family was finally allowed to bury them, and the right wingers were outraged over the decision, something something jebus gods will yada yada. See the hospital said they couldn\u2019t determine sex(even though at that point they should have been able to) but the family decided to name the fetus Nicole(after his wife\u2019s middle name, very endearing I thought). If the fetus really was deformed so badly that sex couldn\u2019t be determined why did they name it after a girl???!? What if it had been boy?!? They must have been lying and everything was developing fine they just wanted to murder a perfectly healthy baby being grown in a dead woman. \n\nJust another reason for to never get pregnant in Texas.",

Because unusually enough the son has no children whereas both girls (my mom and aunt) had kids and made sure they had their family name. My cousin got both his parents last name while me and my brother don\u2019t have either fathers names since our mom randomly went the single mom route.\n\nShe has told me it was so weird having \u201cwell meaning\u201d people asking if kids just wasn\u2019t something she wanted, as she was still childless in her mid thirties. Naah, the guy she had for the last few years kept pushing it off and eventually she broke it off with him. A simple one night stand later she had a son on the way lol. Even more surprised was when she suddenly was pregnant again at almost 40 - that was definitely a last call to choose if she had one or two kids. If I ever have kids myself I plan to give them by last name, simply because I love it and they better take my name if I have to go through the horror of pregnancy and birth.",

We made the family we always desired. So, I went and got a vasectomy. Easy enough. Fast forward 6 months and I'm home for Christmas and the conversation just sorta comes up and I mention that we were done and that I got \"snipped.\" I had no (I repeat NO) idea that was going to turn into a huge argument between me and my dad. He was talking like I took the power away from God and that \"you never know because it isn't your plan, it's God's plan\". I was floored tbh. Like, here I am making an adult decision of family planning with my wife (who had a rough time carrying our 2nd kid). And my dad finds it to be a direct insult to God's will. I also didn't want to put 100% of the burden of birth control on my wife, so the next best thing is for me to go through a simple 10 minute procedure with a week recovery and not have to worry about any surprises in the next two decades or so. But holy shit, apparently that was some sort of satanic ritual I went through according to my dad. Fuck religion.",

Doctor wanted Catholic hospital and its NICU just in case, but choosing that hospital meant having two procedures, two rounds of anesthetic, more costs for the family and more risk!

I've heard (idk if it's true so don't come for me) that when people go for chronic pain enough times and the drs. Cant get a diagnosis they end up saying it's fibromyalgia (sp?).  That would annoy me even more.  Have you been accused of drug searching too?  That one pissed me off so much..  I want to know what is wrong.  I don't want them to prescribe something to make me believe like they're doing something....I want a diagnoses or a plan to find one.",

My psychiatrist keeps offering me adderall and I\u2019ve refused it ( though I am getting close to accepting lol. I want the focus some days) so I don\u2019t think they think I\u2019m drug seeking. \n\nBut the fact that they refuse to give me a better dx than patellofemoral pain syndrome which is basically like saying \u201cyou have knee paid and we don\u2019t feel like looking into it further because you\u2019re too young for a knee replacement.\u201d Like I\u2019ve offered to go for more expensive tests because I want to know what\u2019s wrong and why I\u2019m basically mobility impaired/disabled at 30. I used to be an professional dancer, like ballet en pointe, so it\u2019s not because I\u2019m lazy. They also refuse to give me any mobility aids beyond a cane and have told me to get a brace that works for me, but no off the shelf braces work because of the shape and size of my legs from dance. They also won\u2019t give me a disability placard because in their eyes, I\u2019m not disabled enough. Even though I\u2019m basically home bound because I can barely walk around my apartment. \n\nIve gained so much weight because I literally can barely walk 1/2 a block. I can\u2019t stand for more than 5 minutes without being in agony. My last doc dared suggest I lose weight to get rid of the pain when the weight gain is a symptom, not the cause of the pain. I didn\u2019t gain the weight until I was so incapacitated that I couldn\u2019t do any exercise due to the pain. I can\u2019t walk, ride a bike, swim, elliptical\u2026. All of it hurts and it gets worse every year when it gets cold.",

I've had an arthroscopic knee surgery and they cleaned up cartilage.  In the end it made it worse and I never went back for them to do my other knee.    Once I was out if the army I went to a civilian doctor.  The most they have given me to explain my knee pain is that my legs are basically crooked.  Which they are when you look at them straight on.  My kneecaps turn inwards and like face each other rather than face straight out.  As a kid it was always just called me \"knock kneed\"  I was skinny and had big looking knees.  I also didn't have pain then that I remeber.  I guess once I joined the army and got really active it actually did damage. Where most people's knees will bend up down mine bend at an angle which is essentially making my bones(joints?) Rub together.  I'm still a bit confused on all the terms they used to describe it and have forgotten others but they showed me with a skeleton and that actually made sense.  Like you, I was told there is nothing that can be done for it.  I'm too young for knee replacement and so basically I have to suffer.  It makes my knees throb and I have restless legs anytime I sit or lay down.  Cold and rain makes them flare-up.  I was a bartender/server for years and can't do that at all.  Now I'm a substitute teacher because it's a job that doesn't require me to sit all day or stand all day and I don't have to work when I'm having a flare up.  (I also receive  benefits from the military)",

Then again, we have really shitty genetics and won the injury lottery. We like to joke that he and I will be trying to see who gets permanently wheel-chaired first. Because it\u2019s sad funny. I think I\u2019m winning though. \n\nI have really bad patellar tracking which causes scraping. I\u2019ve had it as long as. I can remember my medical issues. The fact that I got to as high a level of dance capability and athleticism probably made everything worse. I forced myself to work through the pain instead of rest.",

Plus I'm already a bit touchy about physicians ignoring and neglecting patients in general considering two such neglectful and egotistical physicians cost me 8 months of my life, a chunk of my  duodenum, and nearly my life in 2019.  Another nearly killed my aunt last year due to laziness and not checking easily accessible records. There are so many systemic issues with healthcare in this nation I plan to make a career out of attempting to right these wrongs with better advocacy and public health policy analysis. Im sick and tired of my life being on the line because of egotistical physicians who think continuing education is optional as opposed to an obligation. Don't get me wrong I dont hate physicians I just refuse to accept mediocrity in any specialty ob/gyn, GI, or endo etc. In my own short life I have seen way too many close calls to give most physicians the benefit of the doubt especially when its damn near impossible to hold them accountable for egregious behavior that jeapodizes patients.",

You've swapped cause and effect. Religions have a very long, very well documented history of causing *mass fucking murder*.

It makes claims and predictions and expects people to live a certain way because it's right. When those claims and predictions don't come to pass people just don't fucking care. It's the same kind of cult behavior that Trumpettes demonstrate. That's why the overlap is so heavy between those two groups and why the same problems manifest.\n\nAdd in that most religions came about over a thousand years ago and that they have a shitton of antiquated, bigoted, regressive ideas that exist on as \"traditions\" just because. You confront them over it and they say it's their beliefs. They don't feel any need to justify them any more than that and that's fucking poisonous. No. I do not accept \"my religion\" as a good enough reason for you to vote for politicians that want to take away abortion rights and LGBTQ rights. Go fuck yourself and your religion.\n\nMoreover *anything* that elevates faith over evidence and reason is fucking toxic.",

Something tells me you love exercising your rights. \n\nReligion has done more than enough to warrant anger towards it. Even leaving out the *mass murder* how about all the racism, sexism, and homophobia that *persists to this day* primarily because of religion? \n\nReligion hasn't hurt me personally. I just despise anything that makes no fucking sense and has terrible repercussions for the species. Religion is the main offender. \n\n>I'll just reiterate that there is far more nuance than what you are applying.\n\nAnything \"good\" from religion exists outside it. But the bad? That's only religion. Like I said before other ideologies rooted in the real world have to put up or shut up eventually. Maybe it takes a few decades, maybe it takes a few centuries, but they have to eventually prove they work or they get abandoned. Religion has done that beautiful thing of moving itself outside the realm of having to prove itself so it can be wrong as fuck about everything and billions of people across the planet will still believe and just take its commandments as infallible despite the negative consequences. \n\nYou don't need religion to do good. But to do the kind of evil that we have seen out of religious folks for as long as they have been doing it, for that you absolutely do need religion. And that's the fucking difference.\n\nFuck religion and fuck anyone who defends it.",

I would also say that sterilization doesn\u2019t even take away the chance to become a parent, it takes away the chance to have biological offspring. There is of course a chance of regret. But my point is that we let 18 year olds get tattoos because we\u2019ve decided that although they may regret it, it is their right. It doesn\u2019t seem fair that people can put themselves into massive debt for college at a young age, join the military, get tattoos and piercings, but not be allowed to choose whether they want to pass on their biological material. I don\u2019t think regret is a valid argument because any amount of life choices are regrettable, but we still let people choose.",

They also turned the \"stay humble\" thing up to 11, to the point where they viewed suffering as a sort of \"cleansing\" thing, anything sexual was shunned enough to get a member cast out, and brutally repressed anyone who tried to go against the grain. They were like if the Amish were evil. Ironically, after fleeing due to religious persecution, they created heavy censorship laws, and in many of their communities, it was essentially illegal to be non-puritan. The persecuted became the persecutors. \n\nThe puritans are certainly partially responsible for the US's aversion to all things sexual. Many of our anatomy textbooks completely gloss over genitals and breasts, and many parents will nearly riot if a school dares try to introduce any sex-ed, let alone sex-ed more complicated than abstinence, aka telling people \"just don't do it\" despite the fact 99% of the human population will at some point, including the very parents trying to \"protect the children\" who are going to reach age of consent in 2 years. \n\nWhat people are leaving out is that the puritans were far from the only religious group to flee from the US to escape persecution. At the same time that puritans were burning \"witches,\" other communities were coming up with the laws and ideas that would later evolve into the constitution's freedoms of religion, speech, and the separation of church and state. \n\nWhat IS much more responsible for our weird censorship laws is the \"moral hygiene\" trends of the late 1800s and early 1900s. The epitome of this for film was the Hayes Code, which was blatant censorship of movies and shows. Aside from the nudity censors, it also censored things it saw as \"immoral\" or \"wrong.\" \n\nOne of these, notably, was homosexuality. You could not openly display homosexuality, nor could you display characters implied to be homosexual, although there was a loophole. You could have implied homosexual characters, however they had to be the bad guy, and couldn't be sympathetic. This was where the \"queer-coded villain trope\" came from, and it still persists to this day, especially in Disney villains.",

It also doesn't help that at least one religious institution (The Catholic Church) is responsible for slowing down if not halting the progression of science for several centuries.

Prior to large-scale charities like we have today, organized religions were often the closest thing you could find, doing things like feeding/clothing/housing people, caring for the sick or children, etc. Monks were also instrumental in preserving many historical accounts. Granted, these accounts were often wildly biased and inaccurate, but I'd rather have that than none at all.\n\nThey were also instrumental in the abolition of slavery, the civil rights movement, and many other progressive movements in the Americas (look up the Jesuits in South America, they were fighting slavery and mistreatment of natives as far back as the 1600s). As an alternative to Abrahamic religions, check out the Sikhs. They are pacifists, give out free food to anyone who needs it at their temples, don't try to convert you while doing so, and are just in general awesome. \n\nBad people will try to excuse their actions using whatever reason they can. It's much easier to say \"God told me to\" rather than \"I am holding them against their will, forcing them to work for me with no pay, all so that I can get rich off their labor.\" But there's also plenty of good people who do good things for their religion, and many religions still doing lots of good in impoverished areas. Painting such a broad stroke of \"RELIGION BAD\" removes all the nuance.",

My grandmother, who is ALIVE AND WELL saw a young man be lynched in my hometown. She saw \u201cwhite only\u201d and \u201cblack only\u201d signs her entire childhood. She saw black people dead in the streets be picked up by the same folks that pick up communal trash cans.  I just got off the phone with her, a person that\u2019s well and and *votes*. She\u2019s a wonderful person, and even after seeing all that, her republican family roots are too deep now for her to understand why she has to keep seeing this racism. She always wanted to see everyone live in harmony, but southern people aren\u2019t taught politics, they are taught us vs them.  The entire culture down south is us vs them. I\u2019m losing faith that things will change as of recent, but I forget just how recently black people were considered *people*. Truly mind boggling stuff but what seems foreign to me is someone else\u2019s entire life. I can\u2019t fathom segregation, and I hope my grandkids age generation says \u201cI can\u2019t fathom police brutality\u201d.",

It was so hard to deal with her menstruation and then the likelihood of Pregnancy due to rape or if not rape non consent as she had the mental capacity of a 2 year old. Doctors were fine with this of course. \n\nA full grown woman with all of their mental capabilities surely can\u2019t say yes to a tubal ligation though. /s\n\n\nEdit: Thank you all for your concern. \n\nMy cousin is in her late 50s now and yes this was awful. Care in these homes is generally bad the one she is in now is more like a nursing home with their own little areas so it\u2019s a little better. When she was younger (14-17) it was terrible because she was clearly mentally deficient but she was young and pretty and there were young boys there who also were mentally deficient but going through puberty as was she. There were also male caregivers. Not always the best combination. \n\nMy aunt was a polio survivor and couldn\u2019t keep her in her home due to her own physical disabilities. Without too much personal info it was a terrible situation all around. My cousin was victimized for quite a few years. We tried to place her with other family members but the 70s and 80s recession was very hard on our family. Im only a few years younger so it\u2019s still terribly difficult to think about.\n\nShe visits her daughter weekly and she is in good spirits and seems \u201chappy\u201d. She plays with her dolls and is living her best life for what it is. \n\nWhere there are people with weakness, stronger people will take advantage. It\u2019s an awful part of our society. \n\nThank you again for the messages it\u2019s very kind.",

Pts \"forget\" things all the time, say they weren't in a proper state of mind or under stress, or really don't remember what you said to them.\n\nI've had pts deny they had any previous surgeries, and yet when i go to listen to their heart, I encounter a giant mid line scar..\"oh, I forgot about that- the doctor had to re-attach some veins to my heart\".    People actually forget they had open heart, quadruple by-pass surgeries.\n\n\nSo yeah, performing elective sterilization procedures on young healthy women is a huge, huge risk, and not worth  $384 ( yeah, I looked up the cpt payment code medicaid rate) that the ObGyn gets for that procedure.   Especially when possibly faced with some woman on the witness stand 10 years later, crying on how the doctor sterilized her, and she didn't know it was permanent, etc and now she can't have kids.\n\nYeah, no thanks. No way in hell is it worth it.   The crazies ruin it for the normal sane people.\n\nThe average ObGyn malpractice premium is around $150,000.  It'll likely go up if they start doing elective tubal ligations on childless 25 year olds without medical problems.",

I went in to urgent care and the doctor told me he needed to lance / drain it.  I agreed and told him I am very bad with pain, he nodded before lazily wiping a local anesthetic on my finger and then proceeded to put me in the worst pain I have ever felt.  I sweat through a thick flannel for reference.  Fast forward a week and it is now a staph infection! Yay!  So I go back and this time got a different doctor. I told her exactly what I told the previous doctor but she actually listened and fully numbed my finger with a couple of shots (still sucked but was way better and not a traumatizing experience).  I almost didn't go back when the infection got worse because how bad the first experience was.  Oh, and here is the kicker, on the first doctors report he wrote that I \"handled the procedure well\".  The nurse that saw me both times confirmed that was a fucking lie.  \n\n\nFor me I had never experienced anything like this before.  It is crazy to think that doctors ignoring what you are telling them is the normal for a lot of women.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntldr - Male doctor ignored my stated pain tolerance which nearly lead to me not going back when the infection got worse.  Worse than that - it is my understanding that this is not uncommon for women to experience.",

I knew it was NOT normal to go 10 days on 10 days off and put out terrifying amounts of blood. She blew me off every time I came in and brought it up. The excuse she gave was \"I'm just getting to that time of life\". She finally rolled her eyes and reluctantly did a full blood test. And lookey here! I'm so anemic I almost need a transfusion. I had been out of breath and just so tired for months. So she sends me to the Women's Clinic and get an ultrasound. I didn't realize it would be so invasive. Yeesh. But the results were interesting. I was FULL of fibroid tumors. It explained everything that I was going through. So I saw a Gyn/surgeon and she said the only way to really take care if it would be a full hysterectomy. I was fine with that since I was closing in on 50 and childless and had no intention of changing that. It was bliss to never have another period ever again. They had been ruining my life for years and I was so glad to have all the broke parts just gone. But the surgeon felt bad for me for having gone through it for so many years.

Which is why it was so important for McConnell to block all the Democrat nominees for so many years, and why it was also so important to shove through as many far right wing nominees as possible under Trump. That was all done so that (1) the religious conservative voters would be placated with the choices and thus (2) keep electing Republicans who are extraordinarily soft on taxing the wealthy and concurrently lax on all manner of corporate taxation and environmental protections.\n\nThe 1% wins by rallying the religious zealots for votes and subsequently serving them regulation that supports their religious views. We've seen an incontrovertible example of this with regard to Texas' abortion ban. Roe v Wade and women's rights are on the firing line now, not because the Constitution has an opinion on female reproductive rights, but because it's important to the the religious Republican base.\n\nIf all you think they do is 'uphold the constitution' you're probably not prepared to understand the nuanced nature of this long slow slide into Christian-directed government policy, nor how conservative SCJ's can impact the lives of hundreds of millions of Americans in perpetuity.\n\nWe do not have a clear separation of church and state. We just don't.\n\nYour premise that all the justices do is 'uphold the constitution' makes it sound like you don't have a clue as to the power they weild, or the fact that what they're actually doing is having the final say in making interpretations about a flawed document that does not, by any means, cover everything. In fact, the Constitution is so implicitly flawed and incomplete that we have a system for \\*amending\\* it with Constitutional Amendments.\n\nThey don't \"uphold it\", they INTERPRET it according to their own persuasion.",

Because we all were born,  and we all were at the same place as all those fetuses that have been snuffed out of existence because they are inconvenient. They had no choice when they were created, but they also have no choice to live either...  freedom is a right that we the people have, if a person kills a pregnant woman,  that person is charged with killing both.  But the woman can kill it without charges? \n\nOur biology is the problem not lack of freedom!  Our biology is defined by our reproduction,  and the responsibility of us to respect.  If you don't want a baby growing in your body,  you know how one gets there. Don't do that one thing,  don't be surprised if you are pregnant if you did the deed to get yourself pregnant. \nThere can be a discussion about rape,  and incest but that a very small group in total abortions\n\nThe court has never granted full abortion access without restrictions,  and the full bans by states should be struck down,  but restrictions that are reasonable for the technology of the day. \n\nSo if we want to protect life by law, then we are arguing about when life begins.  And for most people that begins when you are still in the womb. Between 60 to 75% if you believe polls. \ud83e\udd14   \n\nI believe in legal but rare.

The ban prevents abortion during a period when there is no heartbeat, there are only the beginnings of cardiovascular cell formation. Ipso facto. It may as well ban condoms, male masturbation and birth control, on the premise that all those unborn eggs and sperm were otherwise headed to become life too, and birth control is killing that chance. Your party has historically fought against birth control too, on that basis. \n\nNevertheless, life does not exist just because certain tissue, which is merely an evolution of other existing tissue, has changed a bit. No heartbeat from a functioning heart muscle, no life. Period. \n\nAnd it is utterly laughable that the argument is 'about protecting human life' when the same people who want to ban a woman's right to choose do absolute fuck-all about protecting that life from the second it is actually born and legally becomes a life (with an SSN and a name). No paid leave for its mother. No healthcare for either the mother or the child. Nothing but substandard safety nets with child care and education. Our infant mortality rate is VASTLY higher than any other developed nation, as a direct result of Republican policy. Just blame the disadvantaged mother instead.  Bootstraps, little infant. Bootstraps. \n\nYou all can just get out of here with your 'wE'rE prOTEcTinG lIVeS' argument until you actually start fighting to protect actual lives by providing parents and children with some semblance of human dignity and a real safe basis to form a strong family and healthy, well-educated upbringing. \n\nInstead we have Matt Gaetz trafficking children like a low-rent Epstein, Trump hanging out with actual Epstein, 'blue lives matter' supporting systemic racism in our police departments, gun nuts objecting to even reasonable background checks and limitations on gun ownership for even psychologically unstable people while we have the highest number of mass shootings (and school shootings) anywhere on the planet. \n\nAnd you want us to believe abortion is about saving lives, when your whole party of rugged capitalist, racist child-sex-traffickers is doing nothing to protect the safety of our children in school, whether it be masks or gun laws, nothing to improve the basic education, health and welfare support of poor families, and nothing to improve access to healthcare for all of our citizens. Instead you're pushing coat hanger abortions on the poor who can not afford to travel to marginally more evolved States where they can safely get an abortion during a reasonable period of time. \n\nAnd ironically, your arguments are all shouted by poseurs on pulpits who couldn't act less like men and women of God if they tried. The Texas abortion ban is brutally hypocritical religious pandering and has no place in US law without scientific basis, because separation of church and state is still supposed to be a 'thing' according to our US Constitution, irrespective of the ignorant religious zealots now populating the US Supreme Court.",

Or a full hysterectomy? \n\nThe only 'moral' arguments to be made against that are either predicated on the idea that women don't have bodily autonomy and are just incubators for babies.

One day I slipped and the handle decided to enter my scrotum, just miss my testicle by shoving it out the way and in to my abdomen. Because of this my nerve endings within my scrotum are so damaged/bundled up that unless I have multiple injections in multiple locations it just dosnt penetrate that bundle of nerves and do its job.  \n  \nThe skin was numb but everything inside was alive and kicking. I could feel the little electric cutting/quartirizer sorta flick my tubes which while was somewhat painful it was more like if you're at the doctors having them check the tubes by hand. Uncomfortable and sensitive but NOT painful.  \n  \nIt's a tiny hole they go in with and while it healed it felt like a small scratch I had done with my own nail while scratching or something of the like. The most pain was at home the nextday where it felt just like a firm grip holding them secure. Lasted a day the rest of the 3 days wasn't too bad at all.  \n  \nSo yeah... that is why I felt it all and my personal experience to which I would 100% support any man getting it done. So long as you remember the cost of reversal is like \u00a33,000-\u00a36,000 and has practically zero recovery time where as a women is in hospital on a table and requires much more time to recover.",

I believe someone asking for a surgery while not sure about it, is in that grey area. However I have no problem with anyone getting sterilized if they are sure about it, as long as they do it following state of art procedures.\n\nAnd yes, I'm surprised because I count at least 3 kids in 9 years and a marriage. The average woman in developed country have around 2 and they both don't want kid, so likely contraceptive usage.

For your lasik example, the doctor can be reasonably sure you won't ask for a reversal because little to no people express regret after the successful operation. This is not true for birth control.\n\nAs for your nexplanon. First every sources I found requires general anesthesia for tubal ligation. Then the operation is in a place with a lot of important organs, making more risky. Finally it doesn't have a really good reversal rate and require another surgery for it. On the contrary, nexplanon is simpler done in a place with way lower risk. Also it has a really high reversal rate as it even have a time limit. It is literally made for woman that want an easy temporary birth control.\n\nOverall I stand by my previous statement: Every doctors should be confident the patient has a full understanding of the risks and consequences of the operation. If not, they should refuse.",

There was no r/childfree to refer to, no websites you could search, and no Yelp reviews. I had to call each and every OB/GYN in the phone book to book an appointment just to discuss having a tubal with no guarantee that they would perform one or refer me to someone who would. Which I did, at great expense over the 9 years it took for me to find another doctor who would perform the procedure when I was in my late 20's.",

The Dr. should just be able to do it without the consent of your spouse.

It was fucked up.  And he was trying to argue with us abt going to the ER, I just called 911 when we couldn\u2019t  move him to a truck without screams.   An hr after he left his dad called to say they were removing his testicle  and it was fully necrotic already    That was around 6pm if memory serves. He started bitching abt being sore around 6:30-7 am. So pretty damn fast all things considered.  \nI\u2019ve busted my back, been in bad car wrecks, had a really bad rock climbing fall, been impaled,   In other words im an adrenaline junkie idiot that\u2019s experienced more pain than most, on a few occasions.  and no pain I\u2019ve experienced even lightly resembled what that kid was going through.

Utilitarianism would hold their blindness causes more unhappiness on others than granting it gives happiness to them.

He said the doc always gives his patients at least 6 mo to sleep on it since it's life altering and irreversible. He gave my bro a year because their boy was just a newborn. Gave them time to make sure the kids was healthy. You never know what curve balls life is going to throw you. OP absolutely could meet there man of her dreams and be crushed that she can't have kids. I understand how condensing the doc in OP's post sounds. But the argument is sound, just presented in a horrible way. I think docs do this pushback as a litmus test to makes sure the patient is truly serious in their conviction to ***never*** have children. If you really want to, you'll come back.\n\nThe whole \"you might meet a man\" argument is terrible, though. Her body, her choice. Nothing wrong with saying, \"ok, come see me in 6mo - a year. Sleep on it until then because there's no turning back. I'll do it then if you still feel that way.\"",

There\u2019s still some (albeit relatively minor) risk to the procedure, and reversing it has very long odds. So they do have some ethical obligation if they know a lot of patients later change their minds, as it\u2019s really a one-way street. \n\nAs a side note, vasectomies are *way* safer and less complicated than tubal ligation. I don\u2019t mean in any way to diminish a woman\u2019s authority over her own body and reproductive choices, but many committed couples choose tubal ligation because the guy is a chickenshit and/or has some bogus macho issues about his sperm cells. Vasectomy is safer and cheaper, so grow the fuck up and take one for the team.",

I was sure I didn't want kids. He simply refused and told me that he didn't know any doctors who could ethically justify performing a vasectomy on an unmarried male without kids in his early 20's.\n\nI remember being so mad coming out of that meeting, not having my will and my wishes respected. But now, after having found a life partner with whom it is a joy to spend my days, we have two beautiful boys of our own and I am thankful every time I think of it for the wisdom of that doctor. I mean, thank god he said no. At the time I thought I knew what I wanted, but what the hell did I really know? I was maybe three years out of high school and hardly knew what was what in the world.\n\nOther people's experiences will be different, I'm sure, and this story isn't given to settle anything.

Young adults, in the primacy of fertile years may feel much differently than someone in their 30s and 40s. Basically the surgery will permanently effect the patients next 20 some years. If the patient does change their mind, the likely hood of reversing the process successfully is not even close to the likelihood of conceiving had the patient not had the surgery. \n\nThere are other, less permanent, but just as effective means of achieving the same outcome. Ethically, unless required for health/safety, I\u2019m not certain why any doctor would perform the surgery on anyone patient younger than 30. \n\nThe spousal consent though, that\u2019s probably just to protect the doctor from a scorned spouse. Obviously this doesn\u2019t apply to the doctor who was more considerate of a future, possible husband. Again, absurd.\n\nEdit: typos",

It didn't change from my teenage years, into my twenties and until I was 31 and interviewed with my fourth doctor who finally agreed to do the surgery. You don't understand that there is legitimate fear in birth control methods failing, as none of them are 100%. How many times I took pregnancy tests just in case. And you don't understand how I didn't want to keep putting hormones into my body, hormones that mess with my cycle, my skin, my emotions, among other things. The costs and fears of this for years, when if I could get a doctor to agree I could stop all of it. Finally I found a wonderful female surgeon who agreed. And it was all covered at the time. And now I'll never worry again, and no more chemicals, hormones, stress and fear. It's been 7 years and I've never regretted it. And for the what if your future spouse wants kids? That's a topic you bring up early on in dating isn't it? And if you and that person are clearly on opposing sides well then it ends. I mean you don't even date. So it's not like you get married and then it's brought up out of no where. If you are online dating that's on your profile if you want kids. If not bring that up. It's not hard. This is about my life and my body. Not about if you understand or if that doctor gets it or of some person I've never met gets it. No harm was done to me.",

I had my uterus two years ago (thanks, cancer!) and there\u2019s a lot of similarities in how they get to that area of the body. You have to cut through the abdominal muscle with four slices, assuming laparoscopic, which is so much better than before that was an option. But if the docs find anything while they\u2019re in there, that\u2019s more cutting and it can get medieval. I have the four laparoscopic scars plus the big c-section scar because there were some unexpected things once they got in. But even just with the laparoscopic procedure, you\u2019re looking at 6-8 weeks for *total* recovery. Doctors are pretty unwilling to perform major surgery without there being a medical need. It is also not accurate to say that someone who decides at 20 or 22 never to have kids won\u2019t have a different perspective in 10 years. You really are a different person at 20 than you are at 30. The whole \u201cyour future husband\u201d crap is crap but there are also hormones contained in the ovaries that cannot truly be replaced by drugs. Take out those hormones and you get jacked right into menopause, regardless of your age and that brings a whole new spectrum of issues to the female body. I was 44 for my hysterectomy and despite having zero need for my ovaries, my surgeon left them in (they\u2019re just kinda floating around, releasing eggs into my void that get reabsorbed) precisely because of the hormones. It is an entirely different procedure from a vasectomy.",

This is bilateral salpingectomy (cutting out the tubes.)\n\nOption 4: Option 3 is great, however in the most dystopian of scenarios where some people just really want the world to burn, someone can use aircraft to get into the facility and release zombies (insert a lab-grown fetus into the uterus.)

Use that autonomy. I know quite a few doctors who were horrible high school students, think in the teens on the ACTs, and they ended up being amazing surgeons/doctors at the end of the day. It's incredibly difficult, but it's possible for anyone if they put in the insane amount of effort needed.",

                                          "text": "I'll respond to your points in order. Number one - yes, it is condescending to be constantly told that I'm going to change my mind about having children, particularly because it happens to me much more often than it happens to my male peers. It implies that I'm just a silly little girl who doesn't know her own mind and can't make her own decisions. I have heard this comment since I first said I didn't want children during my teenage years. Again and again and again, and now you're here doing it. It is condescending, and as the person who is doing it, you have no right to tell me that it isn't.\n\nSure, people change. But many people also don't. Again, my partner of 4 years and I are completely sure that we do not want children. To be repeatedly told that we will change our minds is incredibly frustrating, particularly when no one does it the other way round. You never hear of anyone saying \"well you don't know that you want children, you might change your mind\".\n\nThird: yes, you are infantilising young people. It might not be your intention, but that is what you are doing. You are saying that doctors should never perform sterilisations for young people except in cases of medical necessity, which is ageist and tells me that you think grown adults are not capable of making medical decisions for themselves because they are not mature enough. That is infantilisation.\n\nNumber four - sterilisation is a medical procedure like any other, and no one is forcing doctors to do it. People above the age of 18 are not 'kids', they are adults who need to be able to have say over their bodies, especially in the US where women's right to choose is being threatened. There you go with the condescension again. You're creating hypothetical issues because you personally don't like the idea of sterilisation, hence why you say it's wrong and dumb without giving an actual reason. Your reaction is entirely emotional.\n\nFinally, your small edit is frankly ridiculous. Your solution is that I go to medical school and then somehow singlehandedly change the system? Full offense intended, that's dumb as fuck. You're treating me like I'm twelve years old. I am a fully qualified teacher with a first class honours bachelors and a masters degree. The fact that you're assuming I was a bad high school student just further proves that you like to condescend young people when you know nothing about them. Firstly, I'm not from the US. Secondly, I was the top of my class throughout school and university, being the only person to graduate from my course because of how difficult it was. Thirdly, if I *were* from the US, that's an even more stupid suggestion because of how much your education costs.\n\nI've got a small edit for you: since you seem to feel strongly about this, don't get sterilised. Keep your nose out of other people's medical decisions and stop being such a condescending twat.",

We wanted kids so bad. Tried, had 2 miscarriages back to back. We don't want the trauma of a 3rd as the second one almost resulted in a whole slew of things. And doctors refuse to run even the most basic tests to find out why we can't carry to term, but also refuse my wife the decisions impacting *her body.* Between that and the current health crisis, we are exhausted and done. \n\nWe are 100% adamant on NO kids now. So I guess you're right, people do change. \n\n>I hate how people my age are constantly infantilised when it suits you, but then told that we're adults who need to accept the consequences of our own actions if we ever fuck up.

Which is 20 year olds, hell let's be real here and just admit there's a whole hell of a lot of teenagers cosplaying as adults, wanting to force any doctor to potentially sterilize them for no reason. \n\nIf you would have read my post more thoroughly, you'd see that I do agree when it's medically necessary.

It's extremely easy to sit there and not have to make the decision yourself. You're not the one doing the procedures. Even if it was 99% accurate, as in 99% of people are perfectly happy with being sterile, you'd still have 1% of people who aren't. How many people are you OK with telling that they can't have kids because of a procedure you performed on them when they were 20?\n\nSince you seem to feel so strongly about it, you can do it yourself. Like I told that other young lady, go to med school. You won't care about the repercussions, you're totally fine with the decision even if they're 18 to the day. They're adults with autonomy! So go get that medical degree, then you can lecture other doctors and how wrong they are. \n\nUntil you do, might want to cool it on this one my friend. This is outside your scope.",

People don't need any medical training to know that they don't want children and would like permanent contraception.\n\nYup because it's clear I'm talking to people who have absolutely no experience in the field, and don't know any doctors personally. \n\nSure, people can want a lot of things, doesn't mean you get to force a doctor to do a medically unnecessary procedure. This isn't something like getting your ears pierced... It's often irreversible. It's a lot more complicated than you make it out to be, which is where the disconnect is. You don't see the doctor as a person, you don't see the decision for what it is. You don't understand. Instead of admitting that and maybe asking more questions, you're doubling down on that ignorance. \n\nI'll take the discussions I've had with actual medical professionals who have actually done the procedure, who have actually had legal issues from them over your random 20-something year old ass any day.\n\n>You're also continually moving the goalposts - no one is saying that people should be able to get sterilised at the drop of a hat.\n\nNope, that was my original point I made. The original post is still up, I'll quote it for you. \n\n\"*In those cases, where a woman's health or life is in danger and there's an actual medical reason (Possible death due to pregnancy, for example) then yes it would be a no brainer for that to happen. Now in those cases, I'd be 100% in support of something like a hysterectomy if needed.*\n\n*But some 20 year old kid walking into a clinic demanding a vasectomy/tubal ligation because, \"They just KNOW they don't want children! I'll sue you if you don't!\" Yeah nah, fuck all that noise. Forcing a doctor to potentially sterilize you is insanely wrong and dumb.*\"\n\nThe goalposts have stayed consistent the entire time. \n\n>Of course they should have a consultation with their doctor, discuss their options, sign the paperwork, and perhaps there should even be a waiting period where you can declare your intent to get sterilised, and then if you still want it in 6 months it can be done.\n\nThe original point is that some doctors don't want to risk something like this. You're not going to convince a lot of doctors that this is an acceptable procedure to be done. Morally, legally, etc. Having arbitrary standards isn't going to help.\n\n>What people are saying is that doctors should not simply refuse the request on the grounds that a person has not had children, or that their hypothetical spouse might want children. It's a catch 22 - if I can only get sterilised after having 'enough' children, but I don't want children, then I can never get sterilised.\n\nYes, a lot of doctor's have an issue with this... And? Go be a doctor yourself. Seriously. The reasoning will stay the same no matter what you throw at it. Some doctors don't want to sterilize people, and that should be ok. \"Do no harm\" means a whole hell of a lot, and it's clear you've never had someone else's health in your hands. Because if you did you'd understand why there's such an aversion to this practice. \n\n>If you come out here with your dumbass opinions trying to interfere with other people's medical decision, expect people to react negatively. You're not being used as a punching bag, this is just the consequence of your actions.\n\nUh... Nah I don't think some sob story about someone's wife is really the place for this discussion. It literally had nothing to do with my post. They clearly want to talk about it to someone about it and instead of doing that they're going to come at me and get rid of some of that aggression/sadness instead of dealing with it in a healthy way. \n\nThey need therapy, not to strawman argument people on the internet.",

You're not using any sort of logic, you just keep saying that it must be traumatising for doctors to sterilise people. Why? You need to give an actual reason, not just say its against their morals when you cannot possibly speak for the morals of every doctor and morality is completely subjective.\n\nFor the third time, no doctor is being forced to do this, hence why young people are so often refused sterilisation. All I am saying is that there needs to be some sort of standardisation, rather than people being refused just because the doctor doesn't feel like it. If the rule is that you need to be over 25 and have declared intent and waited for a year, that's fine. But once you meet the criteria it should be allowed, rather than being arbitrary.\n\nIt is impossible to reason with someone whose argument is not based in logic. I cannot convince you, because you are just going to keep responding that sterilisation is wrong and traumatising to doctors (again, as if they don't have to do many worse procedures, and as if they all have the same moral hangups as you).\n\nI think you, as the person trying to ban a voluntary medical procedure just because you don't like it, are the narcissist here. It's as simple as this: I do not want children. If I get pregnant, I will abort it. To avoid this circumstance, I would like to be permanently sterilised. Your being uncomfortable with this is not my problem. Grow up.\n\nETA: just found your response to my other comment. So your argument is that if 1% of people regret the procedure, everyone should be refused? Again, really stupid argument. We don't do this for any other procedure. And again, you've failed to provide any other reasoning than that sterilisation makes you feel uncomfortable.\n\nYou say that I should be asking you because you're oh so knowledgeable about the topic, while simultaneously ignoring the experiences of every childfree person. And you're saying that it's adult to say \"I don't know\" while refusing to say the same. You're a hypocrite.\n\nFinally, telling me to go to medical school is really fucking dumb. It's not a case of me expecting others to sort this issue out, it's a case of it being entirely impossible. Should I do this for every problem I face? If I need a lawyer but can't afford one should I just go get a law degree? If I need to fix my car shall I just go train as a mechanic? No, dumbass, that's not how life works. You're condescending and ignorant, unable to provide any argument beyond \"I don't like it\", and refuse to listen to anyone else's experiences.

You're not using any sort of logic, you just keep saying that it must be traumatising for doctors to sterilise people. Why? You need to give an actual reason, not just say its against their morals when you cannot possibly speak for the morals of every doctor and morality is completely subjective.\n\nOk I will go slower. \n\nStupid. Teenagers. Shouldn't. Be. Able. To. Force. Doctors. To. Sterilize. Them. \n\nThis goes against everything doctor's stand and work for. Do no harm. It's oh so easy to sit there and make the decision with no skin in the game. \n\nThis. Causes. Issues. Later. On. \n\nYou keep refusing to ask, but I'll tell you out of the goodness of my heart. \n\nThat one doctor you ignored? The one with the legal troubles? It was due to a tubal ligation that ended up permanent. Yes, they can sign all the papers you can throw at them. You still have to get a lawyer, go to court, get all the records in order, and fight against the lawsuit. Ended up going away, sure. Didn't even cost too much monetarily. But mentally it was a huge ordeal for around 16 months or so? Somewhere around that number. \n\nIf you want more stories you'll have to ask. \n\n>For the third time, no doctor is being forced to do this, hence why young people are so often refused sterilisation. All I am saying is that there needs to be some sort of standardisation, rather than people being refused just because the doctor doesn't feel like it. If the rule is that you need to be over 25 and have declared intent and waited for a year, that's fine. But once you meet the criteria it should be allowed, rather than being arbitrary.\n\nAnd for the first, second, third, fourth and every damn time I've commented, the overall comments disagree. Read my original fucking post. It's literally right there. \n\nThere were other, heavily upvoted comments calling for people to report them to the board, to sue them for \"failing to act in a medical emergency\" or some other such nonsense. \n\nRead my original post. You know, the one you can't seem to comprehend. I've quoted it about three times to you now? That's my issue is when people treat doctors like servants and that they have to do every single thing a patient wants (Hint, patients are fucking stupid, 99% of the time they have no idea what they're doing... Which is why you go to experts who specialize in these things) If a doc isn't comfortable with it, then go do it yourself since it's so easy of a procedure to do. That's why I keep bringing up doing it yourself... You can't stand that someone doesn't want to sterilize a teenager. That's the hill you're dying on and will throw every single doctor under the bus to get your way. \n\n>It is impossible to reason with someone whose argument is not based in logic. I cannot convince you, because you are just going to keep responding that sterilisation is wrong and traumatising to doctors (again, as if they don't have to do many worse procedures, and as if they all have the same moral hangups as you).\n\nIt. Literally. Is. Based. On. Logic. \n\nThe numbers don't lie. Even if you somehow got it down to 99% of people being completely happy with the decision, you're still talking about thousands of people being infertile because of an entirely voluntary procedure. \n\n(Hint, the true number is about 5% of people who got sterilized under 30 regret it)\n\nThere's no emotion with numbers bud. \n\nAlso really love the whole, \"I know about procedures doctors perform! There's so many worse ones!\" Really talking out of your ass here. \n\nDo. No. Fucking. Harm. How is this three letter sentence impossible for you to understand?\n\nGo try and get a doctor to remove your pinky. Please, go ask a surgeon to remove it. For no reason. Let me know how that goes. \n\n>I think you, as the person trying to ban a voluntary medical procedure just because you don't like it, are the narcissist here. It's as simple as this: I do not want children. If I get pregnant, I will abort it. To avoid this circumstance, I would like to be permanently sterilised. Your being uncomfortable with this is not my problem. Grow up.\n\nI honestly don't care what you do. Go on Google and make a drug cocktail that sterilizes you, go blind, grab a scalpel yourself and slice up your insides, whatever go nuts! \n\nYou're talking about forcing *others* to do it for you. That's the issue. You want to be able to force others to do this entirely voluntary procedure because... You are the center of the universe and the main character! We're all just side characters to your story! \n\nMan I love this projection you keep pulling off. It is really, really telling about your true feelings. \n\n>ETA: just found your response to my other comment. So your argument is that if 1% of people regret the procedure, everyone should be refused? Again, really stupid argument. We don't do this for any other procedure. And again, you've failed to provide any other reasoning than that sterilisation makes you feel uncomfortable.\n\nAh ok so you just completely lack empathy here. \n\nWell, doctors are a special bunch. They spend a decade or more of their lives learning how to care for people, to make them healthy, to extend quality life. It's beaten into their skulls over and over and over again, to always help and never hurt. \n\nSo, if a doctor messes up a surgery and someone ends up losing a leg, they feel that pain and burden. If they have a 50/50 shot of saving someone and they make the wrong call, they feel that pain and burden. If someone 10 years down the line, let's say they've been their patient for 20 years total, says to them, \"Hey, remember when I got my tubes tied? Yeah I really want kids now... Is there any way to reverse it?\" and they have to tell them no and that there's nothing they can do now, the doctor feels that pain and burden. \n\nThank the old gods and the new that you don't want kids... You literally could never see their POV. You wouldn't care if they got hurt, or how your decisions effect them. You're making the right call to never be a mother. \n\n>You say that I should be asking you because you're oh so knowledgeable about the topic, while simultaneously ignoring the experiences of every childfree person. And you're saying that it's adult to say \"I don't know\" while refusing to say the same. You're a hypocrite.\n\nI'm not ignoring childfree people? I know those people. I was one of those people. College was crazy, my late 20's were crazy, and now things are settling down. Dozens of them have pulled total 180's and are family folks now. You legitimately wouldn't think these people were the same guys and gals a decade ago. \n\nLook up the studies. There are plenty, and about 5% of people regret it later in life. \n\nI do know the childfree people. I do know they changed. I do know plenty of doctors and the hang ups they have with the procedure. \n\nWhat exactly do **you** know? You've never met a single person, in your entire life, that changed their minds about kids? Ever? Not a single person?\n\nYeah I'm sure that's the case. Mmhmm, definitely not going to lie about that one. \n\n>Finally, telling me to go to medical school is really fucking dumb. It's not a case of me expecting others to sort this issue out, it's a case of it being entirely impossible. Should I do this for every problem I face? If I need a lawyer but can't afford one should I just go get a law degree? If I need to fix my car shall I just go train as a mechanic? No, dumbass, that's not how life works.\n\nHaha really still harping on that one thing huh? \n\nIf your only solution is to force everyone to cater exclusively to your needs, then yes. You should. If you want to tell the mechanic that you want 30 inch rims that won't fit on your car, and the mechanic says no, you aren't allowed to force them to do it. You'd have to do it yourself. If you want a chef to cook with gasoline and motor oil, you don't get to force them to do it. You can do it yourself. \n\n>You're condescending and ignorant, unable to provide any argument beyond \"I don't like it\", and refuse to listen to anyone else's experiences. If this is the \"maturity\" I can expect as I get older, I think I'll stay as I am thanks.\n\nMy guy, look up the studies. Read something for fuck's sake that's not your own personal opinion. Here, I'll even help. I'm 110% sure you wont' read the studies, or that you'll even understand them, but let's put to rest that I'm just talking with my own voice and not the voices of many thousands of people. \n\n[Scary numbers!

USE SOME SOURCES. For the love of all in this world. You are *not a medical professional*. You do not *work in medicine*. You giving any sort of medical advice or medical policy would be insanely stupid to follow.  \n\nHell I could have had the entire argument with myself because of the reading I've done on the topic, both for and against. You seem to think that your word carries any weight whatsoever. *It doesn't*.\n\n>Masters degree teacher who is mocking you because you want to remove reproductive rights from people.\n\nNah, you still don't seem to understand my main point here... It's been there literally since the beginning. You don't comprehend anything about what I'm saying because you're projecting some weird argument that doesn't exist here. \n\nIt's that you shouldn't be able to force doctors through legal threats/threats to report them to the board to perform unnecessary, 100% voluntary procedures on healthy individuals. 20 year old walks in and wants their ears cut off? Yeah nah, sorry bud not gonna happen. \n\nWith your logic that should be allowed and supported. That's what I'm arguing against. \n\n>There is no point in trying to reason you out of a stance you didn't reason yourself into.\n\nExcept for the studies and data that I posted, but you didn't bother reading any of that so. I guess you can just repeat this statement when it's verifiably wrong. Like the comments are public. Maybe try reading? \n\n>Health care should never be based on what the doctor does or doesn't feel is appropriate.\n\nYes it absolutely should, in cases of completely healthy individuals wanting unnecessary procedures. Previous example of ears cut off. The person wants it, right? They think it's a good idea, right?\n\nDoctors shouldn't refuse any cares in cases where there's risk, but this is a 100% voluntary procedure performed on people with no risks. Doctors should absolutely be able to and do refuse those types of things. They are not your servants to command.  \n\n>Same way I can't just change the curriculum because I disagree with it or think it's morally not right.\n\nThis isn't comparable at all, and it really shows how out of depth you are with the current topic. This is out of your wheelhouse. You have no clue what you're saying here. \n\nIt'd be more akin to me saying, \"Hey, give all your students this handout on why the world is run by lizard people! C'mon, no one will get hurt! It can be extra credit!\"\n\nYou're telling me you'd do that? Really? Just because I command it you follow without question?",

I asked my doctor when I went to see him for some other unrelated injury. He didn't say no, but told me to really think about it and said how it would definitely have an impact on future relationships and he just really tried to talk me out of it. And told me about how it can be difficult to reverse if needed. He was against the idea, without saying outright no. But then my injury got better, and I was just too lazy to go back to the doctor, and then I met the woman of my dreams and I do want kids with her. So maybe it was a good thing I was dissuaded. \n\nBut again it's very different than a Doctor outright saying no to women, also I was obviously being a bit impulsive / ridiculous, maybe my doctor saw that? I want to emphasize no one said they wouldn't do it because I wasn't in a committed relationship. I'm just sharing the story of a doctor putting their thumb on the scale a bit, that's all. Also, this is just one anecdote, not evidence of a systematic trend and may not align with data from the bureau of vasectomies or whatever.",

Not even religious fanatics can be this dumb.\n\nbtw I don't need to ask a doctor, I know why they are doing it. It's you coming here and panicking when asked a simple question.",

I should be allowed to make my decision permanent without others telling me that they know my mind better than I do.  You sign paperwork for this stuff so if you do regret it, tough shit.  Medical gatekeeping is a huge issue.\n\n>Maybe there needs to be a better middle ground though, like birth control\u2026\n\nBirth control isn't viable for everyone and in fact, a lot of the people I know that go for things like getting their tubes tied are doing it because they can't go on birth control.  Synthetic hormones are powerful and not everyone's bodies can handle them. \n\nPeople need to stop denying medical treatment to people just because you don't agree with it or don't like it or whatever.  If I didn't like sterilisation procedures, I just wouldn't get one.  It doesn't affect me whether the 23-year-old lady down the street doesn't want to have kids.  \n\nThere needs to come a point where we just let people deal with the consequences of their actions.  If they make a mistake, that's just part of life.  We can't just keep babying people forever because they might regret something later.  More likely they'll end up regretting not getting the procedure when they end up with kids they don't want who end up neglected or abused.",

If someone who has no other options, sure, but that\u2019s just not the case. \n\n\nWhat detrimental scenario is there where contraceptives are not viable, but getting your tubes tied is?\n\n\nI\u2019m glad doctors run through other temporary options before allowing anyone to make a permanent change to their life. That is a holistic view, thinking of all the actions that 1 procedure can effect in their patient\u2019s lives. Is it necessary?\n\n\nI can agree there should be a point where we just let people deal with the consequences of their choices, but you can\u2019t convince me that 18-30 is that point. Maybe 30+ I could get on board when that stat dramatically drops, but to ignore that is irresponsible of medical healthcare. \n\n\nIn general I disagree with your general mindset of, \u201cwe just let people deal with the consequences of their actions,\u201d especially in terms of the medical field. There are countless examples of that being a bad idea. \n\n\nJust one is, someone younger than 30 has intense shoulder/neck pain and is requesting surgery that could weaken their muscles. There are several alternatives through physical therapy or medication to try long before that option should be visited. The world of doctors just letting us deal with the consequences of our actions just doesn\u2019t make sense to me. \n\n\nPeople ending up with kids they don\u2019t want is the consequences of their own actions. I still don\u2019t want people in that situation. \n\n\nThere are plenty of options to prevent people from having kids, even abortion, and even if your state doesn\u2019t allow it you can drive/fly to one that does. That will definitely be cheaper than getting your tubes tied, or it\u2019ll generally be cheaper than having a child. \n\n\nHumans aren\u2019t perfect or logical all the time. There are plenty of things we all do and enjoy now that we would never consider 10 or 20 years ago. Doctors accounting for that is absolutely important to caring for patients. \n\n\nI\u2019m sure most doctors can walk through options and make a good decision on when this procedure is lower risk, but barriers to have it done should definitely exist. A doctor does not want to deal with someone coming back to them majorly depressed because of something they could have easily prevented.",

The thing is, the military is a career choice and a reversible one. 18 year olds make career choices like that all the time, going to college being one of them.

Healthcare is so bloody expensive theyd make more off of it to offset any of that even if it was a thing. \n \nThe real reason is that most hospitals, at least in the US have religious affiliation.

No doubt about it. It's just the state governments bad way of suggesting this is something that both people have to agree on. Also not talking about if there is a medical reason. If there is a real risk of death or injury during pregnancy this \"talking to your SO\" law should be completely disregarded.\n\nUltimately it is the woman's body so what she does with it shouldn't be an issue because the issue of one person wanting kids and the other not wanting them should have been talked about long before marriage is even considered.",

I called my psychiatrist, as one should. I told him how I was feeling, and he asked only a couple of intake-y questions before he asked \"Do you and your husband want children someday?\" I said yes, but since I was borderline suicidal at that moment, I wasn't exactly thinking about that.\n\nHe spent the next 30 minutes lecturing me on how important it was that I focus on getting my body into tip-top shape... so I can become a mother. My body is \"a vessel\" (actual words), and it's important that I start taking care of myself with good eating and exercise because, and I quote, \"It's not your body anymore.\"\n\nSo I shouldn't feel suicidal because my body belongs to a hypothetical baby that I'm not even sure I want anymore? \n\nRead the fucking room, Doc.",

But again. I have the diagnoses on my files. \n\nI don't need tablets to deal with inflammation because it's all in my head. But when they take me off them my pain spikes that much I'm bed bound. They do some tests and realise it isn't all in my head.\n\nSee where I'm going with this.  That was before I had my second son who was\n\nJust needi g to nurse because my gestational diabetes (completely controlled by diet alone) meant he needed to eat\n\nNo you're not a midwife there is nothing wrong with him having a chest depression like that - even though my first so had the same issue and it put him in NICU so I knew what I was seeing\n\nNo he's just being lazy, dont feed him through the ng tube, even though the Dr's today found his muscle weakness in his neck that had him under speech therapy until he was 3.\n\nHe's fine to go home today, except, we'll the cardiologist needs to see him for a congenital defect that we forgot to tell you about.\n\nAll those things up there about my Son. They are the reason I didn't have the energy to advocate for myself. I was too busy being who he needed me to be so arseholes who hadn't read his paperwork and didn't know his case didn't make a wrong decision that could have caused issues further down the line.\n\nSo no, I won't apologise for not reporting that Dr to whomever you think I should.

That\u2019s reality, logical reality.\n\nThe concept of people who don\u2019t speak up are complicit works in this scenario.\n\nWe all know that in cases of abusers, all the people who surround the abusers but do nothing to stop the abuse or speak out against it, are complicit in the abuse. Even in instances when they themselves are abused, like the mother being abused as well. We see this semantic all the time in child abuse and domestic abuse cases. \n\nThis situation is no different. An injustice is happening, and every single person who doesn\u2019t speak up against is complicit in the injustice continuing to exploit people.\n\nThe biggest lie you people have been fed is that doing nothing is a form of self care. Doing nothing allows for more people to be exploited and benefits only the people doing the exploiting, point blank. \n\nYou can do nothing after you\u2019ve done your part in making sure your experience won\u2019t be shared by others. Doing anything else is selfish and self serving.",

That\u2019s something, and my semantic doesn\u2019t entirely apply to her, even though I think a person should do anything in their power to end an abusive cycle once and for all.\n\nAs an abuse victim myself, I hold every single person who could have said spoken up and done something about my abuser, but didn\u2019t, responsible in part for the abuse against me. \n\nThat environment allowed my abuser to feel comfortable and confident to abuse me in and continue my abuse.\n\nI in turn have made it a goal that when I encounter situations like that which only happen because of a cycle of silence, I say and do something. Similar to what I\u2019m doing now despite people like you defending silence and status quo.\n\n>\tGet off your high horse, let people live, and mind your own business.\n\nThe hilariously on point thing about your sentence, and about your entire comment, is that it\u2019s exactly what abusers say to anyone who speaks out against their abuse. Like you almost pulled every single word out of an abusers playbook.\n\nIt\u2019s the exact kind of thing the assholes I\u2019m talking about say to get people to back off from their abuse and get people to stay silent about the abuse.\n\nGood lord you didn\u2019t even realize that, did you?",

Personally, I had to tell my doctor that if my future husband decides he wants kids, i\u2019ll get a divorce because we clearly shouldn\u2019t have gotten married in the first place.\n\n2) doctors can\u2019t be sued because someone regrets getting their tubes tied. I had to sign several forms stating that i knew it was irreversible, the only side effect of not getting the surgery was the potential of pregnancy, and that i accepted the standard risks of surgery. Only possibility of a lawsuit would be if they didn\u2019t complete the surgery properly, left an instrument inside, general malpractice issues.\n\n3) yes, there are less permanent forms of birth control, but those are an alternative not a replacement. I was offered an iud and turned it down in favor of surgery because i\u2019ve heard iud horror stories and knew i\u2019d have to pay again to get it replaced in X years. Surgery was a one-time deal, and i\u2019m done.\n\n4) a doctor\u2019s personal opinion should *never* be a factor in someone\u2019s medical care. My doctor had gone through hell with ivf to have a baby and still tied my tubes. There was no excessive medical risk, so there was no medical reason to deny it.\n\n5) \u201cjust go to another doctor\u201d isn\u2019t always easy when you have to make appointments months in advance and pay a co-pay, when there\u2019s a strong chance that it\u2019ll just be you sitting there while a doctor talks down to you. People can spend years and thousands of dollars on doctor visits in an attempt to find someone who won\u2019t dismiss them and their concerns about their own body.",

After 30, the rate of regret plummets.\n\nA lot of doctors don't believe it to be ethical to perform a procedure on a patient when data show that a sizeable minority of patients end up regretting it.\n\nOutside of age, there isn't yet a standardized way to identify women who are more likely to regret.  Some doctors use patriarchy to get around this problem (does your husband approve?).  That doesn't seem right at all.  Some require the patient to show a desire for the procedure over a period of years.  Some won't do the procedure on women under 30.  Others treat the procedure like a tattoo parlor and will perform it on any who has the cash.  Outside of the patriarchy approach, I can't really fault any doctor's decision here.  I think it's fine for a doctor to be ok with performing this on nearly anyone just as I think it's fine for a doctor to require the patient to display years of certainty of wanting this procedure.\n\nThis is quite a bit different than abortion as with abortion, there are high levels of regret among women who are forced to carry to term.  The decision to terminate a pregnancy is a life-altering choice with significant levels of regret either way.\n\nFor people who are (in almost all cases temporarily) denied vasectomies and tubal ligation, the denial typically results only in the inconvenience of using contraceptives.",

Not one doctor will ask the woman if she\u2019s ready or tell her hey what if her future husband doesn\u2019t want to raise kids that aren\u2019t his own. It\u2019s the double standard that kills me.

People see doctors as people who dispense services that they want and screening as an impediment to obtaining the service.  That's just not what healthcare should be.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\"Not one doctor will ask the woman if she\u2019s ready..\"\n\nThat's exactly what two different doctors asked my wife.  This is not just to open the discussion for abortion, but plenty of other services that a woman may benefit from if she chooses to bring the pregnancy to term.  In my mind, it would be negligent for a doctor to fail to ask questions to determine if abortion or adoption is a good path.  It would be negligent to not screen for post-partum depression or a need for therapy during pregnancy.  It would be negligent to not screen for a need for social support and welfare.  A lot of people who need it will either not know they need it or not know how to get it.\n\nI'm not arguing that there isn't a double standard.  There is.  It is real and it's unacceptable. That's not what I'm talking about here.\n\nThere's a challenge that people have in thinking in populations.  You may be certain for life.  The data show that there is a sizable minority that does experience regret.  This might not describe you, so the screening wouldn't be necessary for you.  It doesn't mean that a deep screening shouldn't be done for anyone.\n\nGood healthcare can feel invasive because proper screening will always result in questions being asked that simply aren't applicable or relevant to you but will be to other people.",

They just asked him about his medical background and if he had discussed it (not gained approval) with his partner. They didn\u2019t check if he already had kids or tell him he might dump me and his future wife would disapprove. Yes men have trouble getting vasectomies too depending on the area but generally, it\u2019s way harder for women to get sterilized because we\u2019re supposed to be NuRtUrInG or whatever",

They instantly think Appendicitis because of where the pain was, but I wasn\u2019t running a fever so they were confused. \n\nEnded up going in for exploratory surgery and that\u2019s when they found it. About the size of a small cantelope. Ruined the fallopian and it couldn\u2019t be saved, so the right side received tubal ligation. \n\nAgain, I was 12 at the time so of COURSE they told me \u201cyou could want kids in the future\u201d when I asked why they didn\u2019t just take the other one too if I\u2019m apparently prone to this\u2026.\n\n13 years later I ask my \u201cDoctor\u201d (Nurse practitioner in a rural clinic) if I could request tubal ligation for the left tube and she gave me the exact speech. I could meet a guy who wants kids\u2026. It wasn\u2019t that *I* could want kids this time. It was who ever \u201cHe\u201d is\u2026\n\nSo I dumped her ass, went to the ACTUAL female MD on staff and asked her for the TL. She asked if I was really really sure, and when I confirmed that I\u2019ve wanted this since I was *12* she went ahead and gave me the form to fill out. I had the consultation and then was told I couldn\u2019t have the procedure because I was too young to decide I don\u2019t want kids. \n\nSo, I get this a lot\u2026.",

She survived and is okay, but I was told that I'd never be able to carry a fetus to full term. I asked THEN to be \"fixed\" and it was still denied. I tried manual methods, (rubbers, vaginal caps, contraceptive films) but I conceived again. I WAS able to carry to full term with a little more progressive of an effort and some progestin shots, but I still can't get the ONLY HOSPITAL THAT TAKES MY INSURANCE IN MY TOWN TO PREFORM A DESIRED AND NECESSARY MEDICAL PROCEDURE.

The doctor would rather you be mad about it rather than do the procedure only to have some litigious spouse come in and sue for malpractice. Or they would rather you not have the vasectomy until you've had a couple kids, to mitigate someone getting mad that the reversal wasn't successful.\n\nIt's similar to doctors forcing women to take preg. tests before doing anything medical. A) A lot of medical procedures as well as prescriptions go really poorly if the patient is pregnant, so doctors need to be absolutely sure. And seeing as how you can be a few weeks/months pregnant without knowing (as well as patients in general lie their asses off), doctors are going to order a test, and B) even if the patient explains that, to the best of their knowledge they aren't pregnant, if the doctor does something that kills a fetus that the person didn't know about, that's grounds for malpractice.\n\nThis doesn't make it right, but it's at least understandable.\n\nThere is also a sexist aspect to tubal ligation, more so than vasectomies. The idea that the future husband might want kids (as though that's not something you should be talking about with someone in a serious relationship), so the doctor won't do it, is pretty shitty.",

If a doctor commits malpractice in some way, there is no form in existence that will protect them. _Informed_ consent is the cornerstone of medical treatment in the US, and is basically an acknowledgement of the risks, consequences, and alternatives to the treatment you are choosing. Signing the form indicates that you know and accept these things. While I have not personally seen a form for it, I'm quite sure that _any_ woman in the US who voluntarily has a tubal ligation signs a form that discusses such things as alternative methods of contraception, possible complications (e.g. risk of ectopic pregnancy, while rare), and the _choice_ of becoming sterilized. I don't know the relevant case law, but I find it unlikely that a woman would have success in suing a doctor by claiming they, \"changed their mind,\" because the form would include language preventing such a lawsuit.\n\nThey're not doing it to cover their asses.

He asked about her mental health history (she has depression and PTSD, has been in treatment for years, counselors, medication) and wanted her to get her psychiatrists ok that she was of sound mind, but he agreed to send over the surgical clearance. When my wife called her psychiatrist (a woman), she went off on how that is outside of his scope, she's never heard of this, wants his name, the works. She sends over the clearance. Two days before the surgery, the clinic calls and said they never got the doctor clearance. \n\nTwo days of calling the Drs office leaving messages. We go to the surgery not knowing if the doctor faxed it over. When my wife goes back for pre-op, her gyno (also a woman) asks her again if she understands what she's doing and it's permanent all that. Wife says yes. Her gyno says \"I know you know this, we've talked, but your doctor sent over his fax and did not recommend you. He suggested you get further counseling before you proceed. But I am going to ignore his recommendation and proceeded if that is what you want.\" \n\nMy wife got the operation, and is never going to that doctor again. One of the reasons why she wanted to get it done was because she and her family have a long history with mental disorders, and she doesn't want to put anyone through that. But she's relatively young so who cares if she's crazy, she would have very cute babies, right? All I kept think about was thankfully she had a woman gyno and psychiatrist who she has been seeing for years and had her back.",

I\u2019m still in therapy unpacking those memories 10 years after divorce, and I probably always will be. \n\nI was terrified of getting pregnant because I didn\u2019t have resources to get out of the relationship; he tried to control my access to all medications including birth control, and I knew he\u2019d be as cruel to the child as he was to me. I also knew that having a kid would make it more difficult to leave, and that the child would always tie me to my abuser. \n\nI went to my doctor and begged them to tie my tubes.  Rather than agreeing to do as I asked, the doctor called my husband to set up an appointment for both of us to come in to see him. The doctor asked me if I wanted children. I firmly said \u201cno.\u201d  The doctor asked my husband the same question, and he said, \u201cprobably some day.\u201d  The doctor turned to me and said, \u201cyou\u2019re still young. You wait and see, you\u2019re going to want to give this young man children some day.\u201d  I started to say something, anything. I couldn\u2019t. I was shocked. The doctor mistook my fear and rage for I don\u2019t know what\u2026.ignorance? Submissiveness?  Shyness? Agreement?  Then said, \u201cand don\u2019t you worry, when the time is right, I\u2019ll help make sure you get pregnant.\u201d  WTF?  \n\nLong story short- I didn\u2019t get my tubes tide because it was forbidden by my husband, and I had nowhere else to go for medical support and safety. It took me 4 more years to get out of that relationship. I had nightmares about getting pregnant every night and I nearly killed myself. \n\nThe patriarchy can bite me. I have a step daughter now who I love dearly, and I am doing everything I can to let that girl know she has support and an advocate for any reason at any time. I\u2019d take her anywhere in the world at a moment\u2019s notice so she could access the health care and autonomy she deserves.",

She was married, and had three kids, and both pregnancies had been horrific health wise, she had multiple instances of pre-term labour which had to be stopped at the hospital, nearly had a miscarriage with pregnancy 2, and we nearly lost her and the babies both times during labour. Her husband walked out on the second pregnancy, but she ended up having to drag him in to the doctor's just so he could \"consent\" to her having her tubes tied.\n\nThe doctor's argument for not doing it ranged from \"you're young and you might change your mind about having more\" to \"what if your kids all die? Then you'll want to have more kids\". \n\nWe're not even in the U.S either. This is a world wide problem for women. I haven't been able to get one even though I'm in my late 30's, I have a genetic hereditary condition and this condition has already killed several of my cousin's during childbirth. I'm still given the \"you or your future partner may change your minds\"... Yep, I might decide that maybe I want a baby which could kill me. Or you know not, considering I'm in my late 30's and have never wanted kids.",

Most cancer treatments are quite harmful.  All sorts of cosmetic surgeries are harmful and have huge risks, but they still happen.  A kidney transplant from a healthy patient to a sick one is nothing but harmful to the healthy patient.  Having tonsils removed is harmful, and is usually done as a preventative measure during a period that the patient is not sick, which is almost exactly the same situation as sterilization, except tonsil removal has a higher chance of causing long-term issues.  I could go on and on with these.",

Maybe at twenty you don't want children, maybe at thirty you feel differently. It's not really a bias issue to me. It's more of an insurance policy in case you change your mind; in reality, the only one who benefits is you. If you can't sue the doctor, what difference does it make in their lives if a decade later you have regret? The truth is, people often change their minds over time. That's why they have laser removal for tattoos. But, in this particular situation, doctors can't just 'laser' your womb back together. If you did change your mind, you'd have to live with that regret for several decades instead of the one decade to wait to do something permanent. Honestly, you're right though...let people live with the risk of their own repercussions, just don't blame it on anyone else if you change your mind after the fact.

I don't even think you should need to think about it beforehand you should be able to walk in and get it done cause it's a free country.  Be that as it may there is a reason that it is difficult for women to get their tubes tied and that reason isn't mustache twirling sexist doctors it's that doctors don't want to get sued by women who regret getting the procedure done. The reason that men don't have to deal with the same difficulties getting a physical therapy performed is because it can be reversed. This really is simple to understand and the fact that you can't wrap your head around it makes me feel like you're being wilfully ignorant",

It\u2019s not \u201cfeel\u201d I know I don\u2019t have these rights. Do you \u201cfeel\u201d like your missing a right in Texas at the moment?\n2. The whole \u201cthat wouldn\u2019t be taken from me\u201d it\u2019s weird how this is something I see whenever there\u2019s a discussion about issues that affect men. What\u2019s that France? You put a law in place with the support of women that means men can\u2019t use a DNA test to prove the child isn\u2019t his in a court of law. What rights are you missing that wouldn\u2019t be taken away from me and given to you?\n\nBut really, many right and protective laws or laws in general don\u2019t cover men.\n\nFemale circumcision is banned worldwide, even in the most remotest parts of the world your reproductive rights are protected so much that a father asking if a doctor can do the procedure can land him in jail for years.\n\nMeanwhile, you can get male circumcision throughout the world and in most places you only need the mothers permission for the procedure to take place. You know, people making decisions about reproductive organs they don\u2019t have. Like I bet women would be fine with men making decisions on their reproductive system. (Sees post) oh, wait.\n\nA man gets a woman pregnant and doesn\u2019t want the baby but the woman does? Tough luck for the guy. Should have used contraceptive or not have sex at all if you didn\u2019t want it.\nOh a woman doesn\u2019t want a baby even though she used none of the dozen of contraceptives available to women before, during or after sex? It doesn\u2019t matter she shouldn\u2019t take responsibility for not taking responsibility in the preventative stages. \n\nI could go on with other issues, like female teachers grading girls 10-20% better than boys for the same answer, the disposability of men in greater society, rape laws being gendered to only mean men can be rapists and women cannot, positions being given to women or exclusively advertising them for women only. \n\nMany more issues but I\u2019ll leave it there.",

                          "text": "You make very valid points. \n\nI agree with you on most. \n\nTexas is fucked. We agree. \n\nIf France is doing that, it\u2019s also fucked. I does not make sense to not use the science available to you to get the right scientific answer. \n\nI also agree that I\u2019m not really sure why circumcision was ever widely accepted on anyone. I\u2019ve heard the classic its cleaner but I do not know why male circumcision became the norm in a lot of places. And I don\u2019t have a penis but I can understand growing up and feeling like like happened to you and you didn\u2019t get a say. I guess the only thing I could argue is that if the father isn\u2019t there the mother shouldn\u2019t have to chase them down to get permission if she was planning on having a circumcision. But again idk why that\u2019s considered normal. \n\nAs far as if someone gets prego.. I get that it came be frustrating to not have the final say on a baby that you 50% created. But, in my opinion you have to understand that as the body getting pregnant I do feel that I should have the ultimate say above the person who contributed to the pregnancy. \n\nBecause even though they may, it is not guaranteed that the partner will contribute after the fact the way you thought or they said. \n\nHowever, I think ultimately this one falls on you (people in general) because it depends on how you behave. Because if you\u2019re banging someone that you haven\u2019t had all these conversations with. And you and that person get pregnant. And then that woman decides she doesn\u2019t want a baby with you, she has that right. She never agreed that she was going to give you a baby.\n\nBirth control- I\u2019m also going to have to say birth control is rough for us. And it\u2019s not a burden guys have to bear. It messes with your body bad, makes you gain weight, bleed, and feel completely different. That the pill. Others involve surgery and having stuff put up inside of you, it\u2019s not safe. So it\u2019s really not fair to just expect that we want or should be on it. \n\nI\u2019m just not sure on the classroom grading seems a meh and broad but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong to try and give girls opportunities in the classroom, they are still behind in a lot of areas. But no ultimately boys and girls should all be learning everything that they want to learn. Period. \n\nAnd lastly rape.. it\u2019s a special kind of fucked on both sides. It\u2019s takes a pieces of absolute crap to rape and to lie about someone doing it is equally as damaging. Dudes do get raped, but I would also argue that it\u2019s probably not something that most guys worry about happening on a regular basis.. while we are. So yeah that\u2019s a big cluster as well. \n\nThanks for the chat \ud83d\ude0c",

If someone is impulsive enough to get a surgery so they can't procreate only to regret it later, they probably shouldn't be parents. And if someone is sure they don't want to have kids, there's no reason to tell them they can't get the surgery.\nIt's all based on the stupid idea that we all have to make babies because someone said their god told them to or something something white race is dying.",

He added that he might have been more accommodating if I\u2019d been older, had fathered several children and was in a committed relationship. Also, while he didn\u2019t explicitly state that he was objecting on religious grounds, we went to the same church, and it was well-known he was an ultra-conservative Catholic.\n\n> Two years later, I decided to try again. By that point, I\u2019d transferred to a private college on the Eastern Shore. I made an appointment with a urologist at a hospital close to Baltimore. This time, I made sure to clarify over the phone what the appointment was about and had the receptionist confirm that yes, the doctor would be willing to give a vasectomy to a 20-year-old. Alas, after driving an hour and a half to the hospital, he told me I\u2019d been misinformed, as he couldn\u2019t possibly perform the operation on someone so young.\n\n> A few years after graduation, I moved to Italy. Once I\u2019d established residence in Rome, I decided to make yet another attempt at getting an Ides of March performed on my balls. Unfortunately, I was informed by my GP that as an elective procedure, vasectomies were not covered under the national health service. And, of course, both he and the nurse on duty asked me why on earth I would want to do something like that, especially being so young. By then, I was almost 30.\n\n[(*ahem*)](https://www.chicagotribune.com/sns-health-men-choosing-vasectomies-story.html?outputType=amp)\n\n> Doctors tread carefully in such cases. While any man older than 18 can legally get a vasectomy, doctors can turn men down if they don't believe them to be mature or sure enough of their future plans.\n\n> \"I received a call from an 18-year-old high schooler, and that was a no-no,\" said Dr. Arif Agha, owner of the Vasectomy and Reversal Center of Chicago, in Oak Brook, Ill.\n\n> Dr. Kiu Mostowfi, owner of Vasectomy Clinics of Chicago, said that when a 24-year-old man approached him about a vasectomy, he told him he was too young and suggested he come back in a year after he'd thought about it. When the man returned a year later and was still committed, Mostowfi agreed to perform the vasectomy.\n\n> Another of Mostowfi's patients, Justin Holt, 27, said the doctor grilled him with \"what-if\" questions for 40 minutes before agreeing to perform his vasectomy last month. Holt, who lives in Chicago's Logan Square, said he's sure he never wants children.\n\n[Oh, and the ACA doesn't cover vasecomies.](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/vasectomy/how-do-i-get-vasectomy#:~:text=Under%20the%20Affordable%20Care%20Act,the%20cost%20of%20vasectomies%20anyway.&text=Planned%20Parenthood%20can%20also%20help%20you%20get%20health%20insurance.)

You have no idea what the rest of your life is going to look like before 35, this is peak fertility. I'm not saying your opinion of not wanting a child is invalid, but my training is centered around doing the least amount of harm, and I'm not going to turn my back on it now because of an emotionally charged patient demanding a surgically invasive procedure for little benefit over something that could be done much less intrusively (combined methods of contraception). \n\nLong story short, yall need to quit with the anti-doctor rhetoric and chill tf out.

I take issue with physicians who chose to deny permanent sterilization to young childfree women. It is not a waste of surgical supplies to offer women permanent sterilization. In fact when I discussed this with my surgeon over ny reproductive lifetime I will have likely reduced my waste in doing so. It is a short and minimally invasive procedure which provides life long pregnancy protection. Interesting enough the CREST study actually showed that the childfree cohort under 30 is one of the least likely to regret sterilization but overall (like stated below) the vast majority of women do not regret it.\n\nOf course this is purely political. With the state of reproductive rights more women than ever are seeking more permanent and reliable methods. As someone who also works in Healthcare I see why respecting womens decisions in regards to their own fertility is essential. \n\nI didn't realize I had to take time to read every subthread to have this discussion. \"My inability to engage\" in later subthreads  is my tiredness as I worked an extra long shift in infectious disease.",

I have yet to meet a physician at my hospital that would let a med student independently perform a surgery. Additionally I cross confirmed this with a family member who is an attending physician and professor. It's quite sad that you practice in a place that is so anti autonomy. I personally now help young childfree women navigate the health care system in order to receive permanent sterilization from physicians who are reproductive rights advocates. \n\nEliminating the risk of regret by limiting patient autonomy generally is considered by ethics committees to be worse than allowing a patient to make a possibly erroneous choice. It is impossible to eliminate regret, as the very fact of being a fully autonomous human being with decisional capacity carries with it the risk of decisional regret.\u00a0",

Catholics (who believe in women's automomy) refuse to practice or even train in tubal ligation as it violates their religion. Under your world view they would be forced and socially pressured into doing these procedures or risk losing their jobs and training. All the while after they graduate they can just refer. But you don't take the autonomy of the physician into account at all. You think that a physician refusing to do something is violating your rights, which is patently ridiculous and made evident by your answer to the abortion question.\n\nAgain, not moving the goal posts, just dunking on this ridiculous opinion. \n\nAnd I just talked to my colleges, attending, and chair about this issue, literally everyone agreed that concensus is that a long term IUD is infinently more preferable to early childless tubal ligation, and that it would be border malpractice to perform one. Who performed your might I ask? I would like to talk to them and get their opinion.",

I would also deny this surgery myself simply because I have too many low income c-sections to supply for to even think about this surgery. \n\nAnd this still didn't adress my other point regarding safety. voluntary surgeries should have a really good reason behind them and should be avoided if there are easier and equally as efficacious methods available to achieve the same effect.",

Sooo many women have dealt with intense long term pain only to be dismissed with, \"it's just your period\" \"it's nothing/ normal/ imagination\". Sometimes these issues are easy fixes once they have a doctor that actually listens. Sometimes it turns into something terminal because no one was willing to look.\n\nThis is a well documented and very serious issue for women seeking any medical care. It is largely a gendered issue.\n\nhttps://www.medmalfirm.com/news-and-updates/misdiagnosis-epidemic-among-women/\n\n\"Research done in 2016 found that women have a much\u00a0greater chance of being misdiagnosed\u00a0than their male counterparts.\u00a0 Some women spend years shuttling between doctors searching for answers only to find that the disorders other doctors missed or misdiagnosed were potentially life-threatening.\"",

For women it is a given that you will be asked, sometimes denied, based on the consent of people you don't even know.\n\nYour anecdote doesn't prove it's not a gendered issue; women are notoriously infantilized and ignored in healthcare.",

I have never heard of a man being denied a vasectomy.\n\nEdit: [here](https://healthcare.utah.edu/the-scope/shows.php?shows=0_r14awktv) is an interesting interview with a doctor who explains his thoughts and experiences with vasectomies and tubal ligation. He clearly explains that a vasectomy, while still could have risks and pain during recovery, is absolutely the better choice for a cis couple looking for permanent birth control. It explains the differences and the risks. \n\nA procedure being minor \u2260 not being a \u2018big deal\u2019 for the individual - I understand that personally from my own issues. But ultimately, it\u2019s a much bigger deal for a women to get her tubes tied. It\u2019s also a very commonly known issue where women are denied health care until their husband or boyfriend is involved - it\u2019s not as well known for a man to experience the same. And if a man DOES experience that, you shouldn\u2019t be saying \u201csee? It happened to me too!\u201d You should be saying \u201cfuck this sucks. We, as a people, need to fix this for both men and women!\u201d\n\nEdit 2: [There\u2019s a common misconception that if a man had his vasectomy years ago, a reversal won\u2019t succeed. \u201cThat\u2019s generally not true,\u201d Dr. Vij says. \u201cSuccess rates depend primarily on the time since vasectomy.\u201d Success rates can be as high as 95 percent if the vasectomy was done within the last 10 years. They start to decline when a man has had his vasectomy 15 years ago.](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/vasectomy-reversal-5-facts-men-need-to-know-2/amp/)\n\n[5-10% of men who've had a vasectomy decide to have it reversed.  Significant advances result in success rates approaching 95% when a direct vas to vas reconnection is possible.](https://www.vasectomyreversals.ca/?gclid=CjwKCAiA-9uNBhBTEiwAN3IlNBN6kDu3_Z97UJ0ZfcRAjem053AX01eZ0X0tZHXXX_fto79Q4NfOHBoCmR0QAvD_BwE)\n\n[First, the good news. If you had your vasectomy less than 10 years ago, success rates in your being able to produce sperm in your ejaculate again are 95% or higher after a vasectomy reversal. If your vasectomy was more than 15 years ago, the success rate is lower. Actual pregnancy rates vary widely \u2014 usually from 30 to more than 70%.   ](https://www.arizona-urology.com/blog/what-is-the-success-rate-for-a-vasectomy-reversal)",

Because it is harming himself. This obviously is an extreme example, but you get the point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you don't have a tubal ligation and don't want kids, there are contraceptives.

See for example, restaurants refusing to serve black people food. \n\n>\tShe 100% has the right to get her tubes tied and is free to come to an agreement with a doctor to get that done\n\nAgreed. Which is why it\u2019s sexist as fuck to see this story and immediately come to defend doctors rights instead of the rights of the woman. No one is disputing doctor\u2019s rights and this story isn\u2019t about that either. It\u2019s about women\u2019s rights.\n\nBut you see people here bringing up the doctors rights because those people are sexist. It\u2019s their choice to defend doctors when doctors aren\u2019t the ones under attack, that reveals their heart. They may not even be aware they are sexist, but that doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t actually being sexist. \n\nThat\u2019s all.",

Apparently this kind of stuff really messes with your mental state. If you really really are sure about it, go to a different doctor. Besides, if a doctor is really uncomfortable with doing that kind of thing, would you really want them to be the ones to do it? If you think your doctor doesn't know you best, they find another one who does. It is your body and your choice but it is the doctors decision to perform an operation. I can imagine some people may compare it to assisted suicide, many doctors will flat out refuse. \n\n\n\nTL;DR, doctors who do this stuff are tired of hearing that people regret it later on, so they have personal policies about it. If your doctor refuses to do it, and you are really sure, find another doctor.",

My Dr didn't exactly refuse but I've known him for a decade so I knew he was basically kinda beating around the \"are you really sure\" bush. \n\nI said \"Look doc, I'm not exactly beating them off with a stick but I'm staying off that plantation.\" And that was all it took.\n\nI think these stories hide the context. I don't know how old this woman is but if she's young and hasn't had kids, everyone knows the chances she will want them is VERY high, she just doesn't want them now and doesn't think she will want them but she probably will. ALSO, if she does meet a man that she wants but he wants kids, I think she'd be pretty devastated if he was like \"well, you can't have kids so BYE\" and she' probably be on the internet screaming that the doctor shouldn't have done it at such a young age and that the potential husband is a piece of shit and he could adopt, blah blah blah.  \n\nYa know what my doc told me when he approved it? \"Don't tell anyone!\"\n\nHe fucking knew that there could still be a couple women, late to the game, that might just want my seed and resources and if she knew I couldn't have kids she'd bail. So yeah. I'm keeping it a secret. As I said, I'm not exactly beating them off with a stick, but that doesn't mean I couldn't be taken advantage of by a predatory female that sees an opportunity. I'm not exactly wealthy but I have a decent job and a late 30's failed woman might just consider that 'good enough'.\n\nI think if these women had a decent thought-out argument they might make better progress. I suspect the \"I never want kids\" isn't quite good enough to satisfy the doc. And the Dr. doesn't have to do anything he/she doesn't want to. This doc didn't want to do anything to her body. Usually they're yelling about men wanting to do stuff to/with their body. Just seems like, if she's willing to have surgery, might be a bit easier to get an IUD - it's cheap, quick, non-permanent and apparently only a bit uncomfortable for a short while. Sounds better than cutting her body open.",

A good enough lawyer can and WILL argue literally any point they can. You can spend years in a civil suit, and it costs at minimum 5k in retainer plus 100+ dollars an hour to represent your case, ignoring the fact that if you're suing a wealthy doctor they'll have to pay a lot more because of the legal team you'd go with.

Let me explain.\n\nFirst off, I would like to say that it's my opinion that its the patient (woman) and the consulted doctor that should make this decision. The opinion of actual or possibly even future family members is highly irrelevant. It baffles me that you would even consider asking for the husbands approval is some countries. I suspect Conservative values and religion play a part in this but I digress..\n\nWith that said, I would also highly question why a patient would want this procedure done, especially when there are other safer and more EFFECTIVE options. Yes effective, you did read that correctly. I will explain shortly.\n\nThe general population often seems to think that surgery is some kind of quick fix. It's most often not. Opening the abdomen or pelvis, even if laparoscopicly, carries short and long term risks. They are numerous, too many to state here. Surgery should never be undertaken lightly. It should be a well balanced decision. Sometimes surgery is vital, sometimes it's unnecessary. A doctor can weigh these risks and potential benefits better than patients. It's literally a part of the job.\n\nIn terms of efficiency, or efficacy - I would suggest you look up something called \"pearl index\". This is basically numbers based rating system of anticonceptive modalities, ranging from condoms, interrupted sex, hormonal drugs, spirals, hormonal shots, sterilisation etc.. There are values both for optimal use and real world actually use of methods, which is kind of neat. \nIn short, spirals and hormonal progesterone- like implants (subcutaneously in your upper arm), are significantly more effective contraception than female serilisation. Yeah.. let that sink in. \n\nAfter female sterilisation there is a 0.5% risk of pregnancy per year. This compares to about 0.15% after male sterilazation and about 0.25% with a hormonal spiral (IUD). Besides, A vasectomy is reversible and it is a much more superficial procedure with less risks involved. Apples and oranges people.\n\n\n\n\nTldr: Actual MD clearing up some confusion like a good reddit samarithan. It's enough misinformation being spread by self-proclaimed social media experts.",

There is the real chance that a woman doesn't want children, in which case I'd recommend others types of birth control like IUDs, condoms, spermicides, whatever.

In that case, hormonal birth control would actually be the better option to prevent pregnancy and help with extreme periods at the same time.\n\nAbout contraception failing, yeah nothing is 100%, not even tubal ligation. IUDs give similar success without being as invasive. My personal suggestion would be to combine contraceptive measures for a multiplied effect to prevent pregnancy. At the end of the day, if a patient insisted, I'd probably point them in the direction of a Dr. who would be happy to help, though. \n\nAbout the doctors handing the problem to someone else... that's what I've been suggesting the whole time, so I guess we're in agreement in that respect. I just don't want a doctor to be forced to do an elective surgery if they somehow disagree with it. So then we come full circle back to the initial problem- doctors are handing these patients around and they never get the care they want.\n\nPerhaps the bigger problem is, why isn't this transparency made clearer for which doctors are okay to help?",

That did not go over well with any doctor I approached - in fact, my mother's ob/gyn dropped her as a patient because she was insistent that they at least talk to me about it. I started actively looking again at 21, but still got a hugely cold reception. I didn't have good health insurance at the time, so I tabled it again. But every two years or so I'd start calling around looking for a doctor who would consider the operation. I got used to being hung up on. \n\nIt wasn't until I was 28 that I finally met a doctor who could help - but he wasn't an ob/gyn. He was the generalist that I'd been sent to for my first prescription for an antidepressant. We got talking and it came up that his long-term girlfriend had eventually been able to get a tubal as she got older, despite being childless and technically unmarried, because he played golf with an ob/gyn who agreed to do it. If I wanted, he offered, he would talk to his friend on my behalf. I was *incredibly* lucky to have met this doctor and to have him advocate for me. \n\nIt was still a close thing. The ob/gyn was still questioning me to make sure I was certain as the general anesthetic took hold (much to the anesthesiologist's disgust). But I woke up with my tubes tied! I was so happy to finally have that taken care of. \n\nIt was an outpatient procedure. My boyfriend at the time, now husband, had driven me to the surgical center and waited to drive me home afterwards. At first he says the nurses and staff were very supportive, but when they found out I was there for a tubal they assumed he was pressuring me into it. They became so hostile that he had to wait outside; he spent the time while I was in surgery and recovery sitting on a bench on the sidewalk in front of the surgical center - in Florida, in the summer, in 90F heat. But it was better than the overt hatred coming from the staff. \n\nI heard a lot of bullshit about how I would meet a man who wanted children and then I would too. The basic assumption that woman = wife = mother is so fundamental to our culture that many people just can't see past it. They thought they were helping me avoid a mistake when all they were really doing was telling me that my deeply-held desires were invalid, that my autonomy was a myth, that other people could dictate what I did with my body. \n\n...\n\nAs an aside, this was my favorite (if rather ill-thought-out) exchange with one doctor I approached:\n\nDr.: What happens if you decide you want a child later?\n\nMe: I'll get one from the pound like a responsible pet owner. I mean, I'll adopt.",

That shouldn't happen, but a lot of organizations won't allow those who work for them to do things which would dramatically increase their liability.\n\nNow, if it is simply a lot of doctors individually making the decision that they don't want to do those sorts of surgeries for unmarried women even though no liability would fall on them if the woman later had regrets, then those doctors need to recognize that they aren't philosophers and not everyone is going to agree with their views all the time. They need to butt out of other people's personal lives and allow them to guard against unwanted pregnancy in any way they see fit.",

I have a friend who just published a book on infertility and the ultimate grief she suffered when the last treatment failed (after spending some serious cash) and being infertile. And another friend who just gave birth to her second son, but I haven\u2019t seen her in 4 years since she suffered a stillbirth of her daughter and a handful of other miscarriages in between then and her newborn son. At least she got to be a mom but that grief is real deep. Im the most pro-choice person, I don\u2019t WANT anyone to get an abortion because it\u2019s pretty gnarly. And anyone I know whose gotten one didn\u2019t have it on their top ten list for things to do that weekend. That said, that\u2019s why it\u2019s a choice to be done safely. Same as this. I guess I\u2019m just struck by the contrast of people who would pay a mortgage worth of money to be a mother and can\u2019t, and women (or hell, girls) who aren\u2019t ready to be a mom and aren\u2019t being allowed to make that choice for themselves with their doctors. It\u2019s infuriating on political and cosmic levels.\n\nOh ETA: I meant to say i think it\u2019s old-school doctors, or maybe they fear legal retribution as the laws change if they were to make a woman infertile and then the laws close in on them. All of a sudden they are guilty of a crime, or what if they botch it and there\u2019s a horrific unexpected pregnancy outcome because it wasn\u2019t done correctly. It might be more saving their ass down the line. Someone else can weigh in maybe.",

But in a lawsuit happy world, the fact is that the revenue generated by the surgeon doing elective procedure, is not worth the risk of a patient coming back later and suing, (yes even if they sign a waiver), due to not being able to have kids.\n\nThere just exist too many other options, i.e birth control, IUD, condoms, abstinence, etc, that a judge could point to as to why a surgeon did an elective procedure.\n\nI am in complete agreement that your body your choice. I'm just trying to give the perspective of the surgeon.\n\nNote, I am not a surgeon. And in case it wasn't painfully clear, I am in complete support that you should be able to make that decision and have a surgeon be willing to do it. \n\nWhen you're actually in the medicine world, you realize a ton of what we do is completely cover your ass.",

I think it's good for Doctors and patients to have that freedom of choice.\n\nHad a nurse friend that was following up with a patient while the physician was there. The doctor knew these patients for over 15 years and was close to them. The patients came in to request ivermectin because they were scared of the vaccine and scared of COVID. The doctor told them he would not. They got pissed and told the doc to go fuck himself and that they would never come to him again \ud83e\udd37\n\nObviously different than a woman trying to get tubes tied but same foundation. Person wants a doctor to do something for their body. Doctor says no. Patient can go to another doctor. (I don't know what doctor would prescribe ivermectin tho)",

She points to a 1999 study from Center for Disease Control (CDC) researchers that included 11,232 women aged 18-44 years who had tubal sterilizations between 1978 and 1987. Of the women under age 30, 20% regretted having the surgery. Gunter says that 20% is \u201chigh with surgery\u201d and points to the less than 1% regret rate for people who have had abortions as a comparison.\"",

We felt like three was enough but I wanted to keep the option open to have another (and hopefully it would have been another boy) if we changed our minds.

Year and a half later after our son was born, I was filing for divorce as I found out he had been cheating off and on for many years on me. I was still fairly young (only 27) and felt robbed of being able to have another child if I was lucky enough to end up with someone else who wanted children of their own too. Now I am 50, still regret having it done but at the same time also relieved because the next man I was in a serious relationship also wanted to have a child with me was also a cheater which I found out about 4 years into the relationship.",

Further still, in America the patient is paying *money* to be there (in one form or another) as well as the doctor themselves is receiving *money* to simply say \"no I don't think you have the capacity to make this decision about your own reproduction\". It seems almost unethical, strange, and quite honestly far from what I would expect from a true healthcare setting or even the reality of the way medical services are bought and sold in America (with money). When it comes to decisions about autonomy like this (as described) it feels like the situation devolves into some weird dynamic almost approximating a parent/child relationship in they way they just say \"you haven't thought it through...maybe this...maybe that\".",

If a man or woman wants a permanent method of birth control, they should be provided with it. Good people with medical licenses perform the procedures without outdated assumptions about a patient's choice to not procreate. \n\nThe 35 year old woman who got her tubal ligation in her 20s is still able to have a child either through a tubal reversal or IVF in her 30's. The eggs do not decay, they are just blocked from being inseminated. In addition to having the fallopian tubes cut and/or cauterized, the tubes can be simply tied off or even blocked, which increases the likelihood of successful reversal. \n\nNor is this just an issue for women. Men may not face as many arguments when they want to get a vasectomy, but many still have faced some as well. You will see the comments of men who wanted vasectomies and got pushback from their doctors about \"changing their mind later\". This is even dumber since banked sperm is viable longer than banked ova are and a vasectomy can successfully be reversed 80% of the time. \n\nYou can read through the comments and see many instances where the woman in question had a medically valid reason for not wanting kids of her own and was content with adopting or taking in foster children and the doctor still refused to perform or even suggest a reversible tubal blockage as a compromise. This is not the actions of a good person, it is the actions of a doctor who is enforcing their own views about procreation on their patients.",

A doctor can refuse for whatever reason, and since it\u2019s an elective procedure, a patient has no leverage if the doctor says no. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re leaving a cancerous tumor in the body, they\u2019re just refusing to do a surgery that is medically unnecessary. I don\u2019t think they *should* be able to refuse without a medically valid reason, but they won\u2019t take a hit for it so it\u2019s whatever. I was able to get my surgery done at 25 (or 26? Bad memory lol), but most aren\u2019t as lucky as i was.",

There was a time when this was required, how ever a woman doesn't actually need to get her husband's consent to get her tubes tied anymore.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat should be said is that they won't do the procedure because SHE may come to regret it later. Looking at her profile pic, she looks pretty young. If she had her tubes tied now, then later on in life she may decide she'd like to have kids but can't because of the decision she made when she was young.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's easy to think \"Oh yea, I'll never want kids\" when you're young. A lot of people think that way, and then as they get older they change their minds. Either a family member, or a friend has a kid, they interact with the kid and decide they want one too. By the time you're 30, you're going to be a completely different person than when were 20. You'll look back at how you were at 20 and think \"Wow... I was dumb\". There are a lot of women who got their tubes tied when they were young, and regret it now that they are older because they changed their minds and now want kids.",

Alternatively, just to insert a counterargument in here because I see all of the same opinions in the comments, I can imagine there is a substantial amount of regret from some people if they decide to get their tubes tied and then want children later. A quick google search tells me thatit's like 65-80% successful to reverse below age 40. After 40, apparently its 25%? \n\n&nbsp;\n\nGiven that, at least in the US, it's the doctor's right to not perform a surgery if they don't want to just as it is the right of someone to pay for an operation to make them unable to have children. It makes sense that someone might not want to perform those sorts of surgeries on young women. Also, plenty of women and men go into relationships not intending to have kids and then end up deciding to have kids. It can be hard to tell what you might want in the future.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe woman in the photo looks quite young. If I was a doctor, I can see a possibility of me wanting to avoid guilt if it couldn't be reversed in the future. Imagine someone coming back to you and blaming you because they can't have kids now--even if it was their decision. Idk...\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSeems less likely that it's about a woman's choice or a man's choice, but more about it being a decision someone can make when they are younger and regret later. Like a tattoo. All that being said, I disagree with her conclusion. I don't mind myself if she doesn't reproduce. The way she framed this is so defensive, as if \"evil men\" are out to get her. More power to her if we have less of that cancerous narrative around.",
