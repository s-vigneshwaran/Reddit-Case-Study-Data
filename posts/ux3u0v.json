              "text": "As an American, through my experiences, those that are so adamant about guns, is for protection reasons primarily. This is backed up with their distrust in \"the government\" and want to be able to control and defend, if need be, their property and family.  There are those that also enjoy the hobby of collecting and shooting guns for sport. You would find, for the most part, that these points of view would be found in more rural areas, where the properties are more vast, where your closest neighbor might be a 5-10 walk down the road. The access to police usually entails a town of maybe 4 police cars where the response time might be a little critical. For them, having a tool like a gun is an important item to have accessible. \n\nThen you have those that want to make sure that they are protected when they go out in more crowded areas. To them, having a gun is not looked at through the lens of becoming a danger to the public, but being prepared of the unknown. And for the most part, I do think that most fit in that group of people. \n\nFor the two groups I've mentioned, it boils down to being prepared. They want to have the ability, to react to a situation where if danger arrives they can respond to it quickly. Where response time is critical in these sort of settings, like the mass shootings, waiting for the police to arrive vs responding to said shooter immediately, could be the matter of losing a small amount of lives vs a large amount of lives. It's a very reactive sort of way to handle a situation. But there are those in these groups that believe that the knowledge of the public having guns will deter people from following through, as they are fed inaccurate information because the media that supports their side, tells them that the shooter targeted the area BECAUSE it's a gun-free zone. \n\nThen there is the gun-reform control crowd that is looking at these sort of situations in a proactive sort of way, where they don't want to give people the sort of tools necessary to enact the type of violence we see. They want to deal with the steps that lead up to the person physically getting the gun to shoot people. They don't want the person that is not mentally stable to have the access to a gun because they believe if you don't have access to a tool, you can't harm people. Which is ridiculous, because there are more impactful \"tools\" one can use to harm others. \n\nThen insert the political parties in this country, as well as the media that benefit from the divide of Americans on the topic. It's next to impossible to come to a compromised solution because of the fear mongering going on. You have those that don't want anything to regulate guns, and you have the other loud voice that are placing blame on the guns. When you have such polar opposites, with the media pushing fear at people, you're not going to get anywhere\n\nFrom my perspective, I would love to see some push from the pro-gun crowd to push for something other than \"make sure you have your gun\" type of solutions, and I think we can get there if the gun-reform crowd would stop pushing the \"guns are the problem\" narrative. \n\nI think if we can tackle the systematic issues that lead to the motivation to turn to using guns on fellow citizens, that we can turn down the violence that we witness in this country. It would benefit both groups in this country. If Systemic Racism would be agreed to exist and were worked out to be eradicated, if Income Inequality gaps were shrunk, if Social Media and MSM outlets were held accountable, and benefitted from being truthful and responsible with their reporting and what they allowed on their platforms instead of profiting off of outrage and pushing fear mongering under the guise \"free speech\", we might just be able to lower the tensions citizens have towards one another, and maybe we would just be able to have confidence in our communities that compromising, and working on coping through problems in a non-violent manner, might help. Hell, the pro-gun crowd might just get their wish of being able to open-carry so they can be prepared, without fear of their guns being targeted by those on the left. \n\nIn short, America needs to change their culture and systems within, and in doing so, may be able to accomplish their wishes of more freedoms.",

No one batted an eye. These children are dead because of the negligence of adults. The negligence of the gun store owners, the negligence of the shooter's parents/guardians, and the negligence of the Texas and Federal Gov't. The blood of the thousands of shooting victims are on their fucking hands. They were 1st-3rd graders, man. They don't deserve this, no one does.\nEdit: After reading the comments about the gun laws, it seems I was wrong. His parents probably bought the guns for him. If you see on the shooters instagram page he posted two heavy assault rifles. Apparently he took a handgun and an assault rifle into the school. He could have very easily lied on the \"psychological background check\" (questionaire). Guns are so easily accessible to murderers. I ask all the pro-gun people that argue that; \"There's always a good guy with a gun.\" Where is your good guy now?",

However, the background check form is _extremely_ easy to lie on. It's mostly checkboxes, with a few things to verify your identity (citizenship and felony status, etc). \n\nHere in Wisconsin you just check one box \"yes\" and the rest of them \"no\" and put your name, date of birth, ssn, etc. and it goes through a mostly automated system. Sometimes there's a phone verification needed but I've only had that once and I think that was because I was buying a gun on Sunday. It's like, ridiculously easy to pass the background checks. I'm surprised Wisconsin hasn't had more shootings to be honest, but I guess most kids go through hunters safety and they're used to being around guns. Idk.\n\nSorry, my reply got a bit longer than I anricipated\n\nEdit: I'm not a conservative, I'm a liberal gun owner. I think there is a lot of room for improvement in our gun laws bot at the state and federal level. And we need to start properly funding mental health support and research to help the people who feel like committing these tragedies.",

                  "text": "So that's the federal background check we currently have which basically says you can't be a felon or convicted of specific violent misdemeanors. It's automated and relies on states to send conviction data to the feds. Edit: it also says you can't be an addict or have a mental health issue, but you can lie about that because no one checks because there's no way to check. So, the common advice is \"just answer yes here, and no to the rest\" -- most FFLs will not have you read the single page you fill out some info and check a couple of boxes on and then sign. Seriously one page with 9 questions and some basic info that gets scanned and run though an automated DB, a form on which you can lie about two of the questions, that is all that stands in the way of basically anyone reading this and so many other people from owning a gun in the next hour.\n\nMost people don't get how easy it is. If there's a 24h pawn shop near you, you can own an AR-15, an AA12, a couple of Glocks, and a nice bolt action .308 with a heavy magnification scope for around $2000 (depending on location and actual model of the stock) within the hour, this hour right now, it takes the amount of time to drive there plus like 5 minutes of filling out a page of basic info and checking some boxes. \n\n\nHere's the thing though. That's a crazy lax standard for background checks. Even the laws for a CHL in fucking Texas are more restrictive. Well were more restrictive. You don't need a CHL in Texas anymore, if you can own the gun you can carry it concealed. \n\nThere may be a background check, but it's not checking for so fucking many things it should be. And if it weren't federally mandated, most states wouldn't have one. \n\nAlso, if you buy a gun from a private citizen who's not a FFL then there's no background check. So, Tom who isn't a felon can buy a gun on Monday, decide he doesn't want it and sell it to Bob, who is a felon, on craigslist on Tuesday and that's a legal sale. Bob is breaking the law by possessing the gun, but it wasn't a regulated or illegal sale. The sale having the same effect as selling a felon a firearm. \n\nThese sales are not regulated so no receipt or transfer of ownership paperwork or anything like that exists. There is no paper trail linking Bob to the gun unless Tom goes out of his way and goes through the hassle of creating one. Nevermind the fact that Tom has no power to verify any information Bob gives him. \n\nSource: FFL holder and outspoken far left Marxist",

Just last week my dad had a rummage sale and one of his customers was talking to him about guns and asked if dad had any for sale. My dad sold this total stranger a 12 gauge shotgun for $60 at a rummage sale. And that sale was perfectly legal. No laws were broken, there is no way to track the sale, no background checks were performed, and if the gun is used in a crime there's no way to track it down to anyone because my dad got it from a different private party in a similar fashion. It's stupid how easy it is to get a gun in this country. I'm pro 2A but something has to change because this is absurd.",
