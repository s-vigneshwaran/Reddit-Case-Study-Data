  "text": "TIFU by accidentally teaching my roommate's parrot to sing CBAT. My roommate doesn't know yet.\n**Bird audio hyperlinked at the very end**\n\nI am so dead. My roommate is out of town camping until the end of the weekend and he's going to kill me when he finds out.\n\nOk, so we all know the story with [CBAT](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/x35iu6/tifu_my_20f_girlfriend_of_two_years_told_me_the/), no need to go into that. My roommate is out of town for a week, and I have the whole apartment to myself. Four days ago, I (29m) asked my gf (29f) if she would like to enjoy some delicious fun time while blasting CBAT. Her and I are both super weird, and are open to doing this kind of dumb stuff. To no surprise, she laughed and said yes. I just thought it would be funny to experience. To my surprise, it really wasn't as weird as I thought it would be. It might be that the love I have for her is so powerful, that it left only about 5% of my brain power focusing on the dolphin sounds in the background.\n\nThe next day we decided to go at it again, only this time CBAT was a surprise for her. After a few minutes of kissing, I turned on the music and we both started laughing hysterically before getting it on. I even lasted longer than the day before, which I now regret.\n\nHere's the problem which I stupidly did not even take a second to consider. While my roommate is out of town, I'm taking care of his parrot who dwells in our living room, which shares a very thin door with my bedroom. This is no ordinary parrot. This is a chattering lory (same bird as that red one on youtube who goes \"wuewuewue\"). This bird does not shut up. He makes so much noise that I've naturally learned to ignore him after a year of living with it.\n\nAnyway, somehow it never even crossed my mind that these parrots learn words and sounds and mimic them surprisingly accurately. Before leaving for work yesterday morning, I made some coffee and sat down in the living room for a bit just relaxing and closing my eyes. All of a sudden, I hear the first few notes of CBAT in perfect pitch and rhythm. I opened my eyes and this little dude is staring me dead in the face. 5-10 seconds pass, and I hear it again. I just grabbed my things and left for work immediately. I had to escape, figuring I'd just find a way to fix this or explain this later. But the more I think about it, the more I realize that I'm just dead. My roommate isn't weird like me and he hates when I say silly things to the bird. When he comes back this weekend, I'm worried he's gonna give a notice and leave.\n\nAny advice on how to go about this would be greatly appreciated. I'm sweating as I'm writing this.\n\nAnd no, for privacy reasons, I will not be posting a video of the bird.\n\nTL;DR I tried intercourse with my gf twice while blasting CBAT just for the experience, and my roommate's parrot learned the song. My roommate doesn't know about this yet.\n\nEDIT: When I get back home from work today, I will sit by the bird and record audio.\n\nEDIT 2: Hyperlinked CBAT above for those who haven't read the story.\n\nEDIT 3: [Here\u2019s the audio you skeptics](https://voca.ro/16NdnZIFs0d4). Enjoy CBIRD. God help me.",

Not just the words but the tone and pitch of them. With some species like African Greys they can mimic a man saying cow then a woman saying cow and go back and forth between the two voices saying the same words. One of my birds takes whatever he\u2019s learned to say and combines it with his screaming and suddenly he\u2019s screaming KKKEEEEEYYYYY WIIIIII! saying his mates name kiwi when I\u2019ve never said it like that.",

It\u2019s kinda abominable to nature because the bird thinks they can mate with you and gets frustrated, but it really is a bond that can\u2019t be replicated by any other animals imo. Just because they are biologically programmed for monogamous relationships and they require social interaction from their loved ones. So to them if they bond to you, you\u2019re their whole world basically. Which to me is probably a relationship that can\u2019t be replicated even with other humans because we so often fail to trust our partners. Now the only problem is their birds and birds can annoy the shit out of you just being who they are sometimes. I understand the reasoning and psychology behind why they do the things they do but my Caiques screaming at me every time I walk out of the room still annoys the shit out of me and there is nothing I can do about it because birds be birds lol.",

Parrots in general will only bond to one creature, that can be you or it could be another bird. If you want a creature that will devoted specifically to you and only you then you get one. If you get two their gonna bond to each other and depending on the species it\u2019s possible they become aggressive towards you. There are species that are flock birds that welcome others in close to their relationship but not all species work that way. Myself I have a pair of caiques and caiques are one such species that allows me to be the 3rd wheel and they not be aggressive. Birds like macaws, pionus, conures, and poicephalus tend to bond to another bird and can be aggressive. I\u2019m not gonna say this is always the case because I\u2019ve seen way weirder things. I\u2019ve seen people who have entire flocks of birds 10+ of all out in the house together living harmoniously, with extremely aggressive species and their owners can still manage them. Although I feel like those kind of people are okay with some of their birds being just handleable to the minimum necessary extent. Personally my caiques stay away from everything else because they are extremely aggressive towards other species and will kill any bird their size or smaller.",

It\u2019s honestly in my best interest to be knowledgeable on how to care for them properly and understand the psychology behind why they do the things they do. Many folks buy parrots, stuff them in a cage and get upset when it starts screaming and biting then get rid of them. Which is pretty horrible to think about considering how wide of an emotional spectrum they possess. To properly care for them, honestly they shouldn\u2019t be seen as pets. It\u2019s far easier to see them as companions than pets because they are wild animals. They will never be submissive like a dog, they will never just want to do something that is not in their best interest. So it\u2019s honestly just better to build a relationship on trust with the bird than it is to try and make it bend to you like people do with dogs. Parrots that are well cared for and happy have amazing bonds with their care takers which translate to an easier life as an owner. Unhappy parrots equal unhappy owners, because nobody wants to coexist with a little screaming demon not giving you a moment of silence and chasing you around the house trying to send you to the ER for stitches. I\u2019ve read about every book I can get my hands on for avian psychology and training at this point and I\u2019m still constantly overcoming problems and frustrations with parrots. Their such difficult animals to keep that you just have to try and make the most of it. Plus who doesn\u2019t want to show off their parrot riding a little bicycle around the kitchen to their friends lol",

I call them 3 year olds with knives and some have a pneumatic vice too for fun. We are also incredibly inept in reading their slight feather shifts to indicate mood changes so they seem far more aggressive than they actually are as they gave ample warning that we just didn't pick up on. There is of course also the odd sadist that has been inadvertently trained into biting is fun",

I had one of my caiques bite my index finger while I was trying to dislodge him from being stuck. He bit down full force square across my finger with it entirely in his mouth and it left a purple ring around my finger without breaking the skin. Which to me just shows how powerful their bites can be to instantly bruise a ring. A macaw would just break my finger. \n\nIn parrot training there is a philosophy concept of permission based training and it alleviates a lot of the misreading of body language. It basically involves never forcing the bird to do something it doesn\u2019t want to, but instead asking the bird if it wants to. It prevents situations where the bird feels like it has to bite or be forced to do something it doesn\u2019t want to because that\u2019s what\u2019s happened in the past. So if I come up to a bird and say Kiwi can you step up? and she can make the choice to step up or not. If no then maybe with some  bribery she will.",

We took in a cocktail that no one wanted and we didn\u2019t know anything about birds. As someone that likes to think myself as well educated in parrots now it makes me really really sad to think of what that little guy went though psychologically. I\u2019ve always liked observing birds as they as fascinating marvels of the animal kingdom, but I never really put much though into do they act with reason. \n\nNow with an abundance of books read and parrots of my own I can tell you they have HUGE personalities when cared for properly. My Caiques I don\u2019t even know how a little thing can have such personality, they are larger than life sometimes. It\u2019s like watching a cracked out toddler that can fly, walk upside down hanging, and mimic the sounds of my phone notifications exactly for attention. They have absolutely no regard for how small they are and if they don\u2019t like someone they will make no hesitation to hunt them down. I mean literally\u2026 they dgaf. They will get on the floor and start running as fast as their little penguin walking legs can take them then stalk someone to try and bite their toes or something. All my birds know their names and recall on command, they know what they shouldn\u2019t do in the house, and they can do basically everything a dog can do. The Caiques will lay on their backs and wrestle with my hand. The blue and gold macaw will lay in my arms like a baby on her back and play with my hand as I tickle her. The caiques will play fetch with me as I throw little cat toy balls. So needless to say they can make great companions for the right person. Now with that said that\u2019s all the good and none of the bad or mention of how much work it took to build those relationships and tame/train them to that point. Training even the most difficult dogs is child\u2019s play sometimes compared to dealing with birds. Sometimes it\u2019s literally a battle of willpower and patience and if you run out it\u2019s probably gonna cause behavior problems with the bird afterwards. I\u2019m talking months or years sometimes daily to train a behavior. I spend a minimum of 15-30 minutes a day first thing when I get home on each bird for just keeping them tame/trained. Usually it ends up being more like an hour sometimes more depending on what I\u2019m doing for the session. A lot of their personalities really shine when you work with them and bring out their little individual quirks. But it really is a long term project for each bird that requires slow steady patent effort that not many people can achieve.",

Parrots REQUIRE a special kind of person to coexist harmoniously. I would consider parrots an experienced bird owners pet and birds in general an experienced animal owners species. Anything outside a budgie parakeet to be an extremely difficult animal to care for properly. I would imagine 90/100 people would not be able to provide the care required to keep parrots happy and still stay sane. Finches, canary\u2019s, and budgies are rather easy birds to care for and you just basically feed them and give them some toys. But, any true parrot is like owning a two year old toddler that never grows up for 25-80 years. It can get very very tiring no matter how much you understand the psychology and reasoning behind why they do what they do. Don\u2019t get my wrong I love my birds but holy shit sometimes you just want to be left alone and hear silence. I can\u2019t go on vacation, I can\u2019t leave them alone for very long and I have to get back home asap to let them out and keep them happy. If I\u2019m away for a couple days they will act like i\u2019m a stranger and kick me out of the flock. Like even to this day after the tens of thousands I\u2019ve spent on my birds and the countless hours educating myself I can\u2019t say for certain I would make the choice to get parrots again.

I\u2019ve seen parrots make an anger display towards an owner bobbing it\u2019s head, the owner bows and mimics him mocking the weird behavior.

I would highly recommend getting just a hand fed budgie from a breeder (not a pet store!) and learning as much as you can about training parrots. If you can make that budgie lay on its back and recall to you and after a couple years of care I would say true parrots might be right for you if you still wanted one. I recommend a budgie because for one as sad as it is, their cheap and abundant. Hand fed true parrot species are expensive. Often in the thousands and can sometimes be difficult to find the right one from a breeder. The other reason is they are generally far far easier to take care of and they don\u2019t live as long. After budgies I usually recommend cockatiels, parrotlets and lovebirds, due to their availability, size, requirements, and noise level. After those basically every other species can be very difficult and all consuming. Cockatiels in particular are very sweet in nature and make great family pets when cared for properly and hand fed from a breeder. All of these second choice birds can live 20-30 years. I once had a cockatiel live around 25 years, he was a tough SOB. Just some stuff to keep in mind",

So needless to say we didn\u2019t know how to properly take care of his needs. Which is a shame, I now look back knowing what I know now and wish I\u2019d at least done some research on what they need. My family had that tough old SOB for 20 some years and I think he could have been part of the family if we\u2019d known more about it. He survived so much shit that we didn\u2019t know would kill him. We didn\u2019t understand how intelligent they are and that they aren\u2019t just some mindless bird that eats, sleeps, screams, and shits. I know now what hand fed well raised cockatiels are really like and they are very intelligent sweet birds with very cheerful personalities. I\u2019m just ashamed that I didn\u2019t know any better which is why I don\u2019t own cockatiels now. I kinda feel like I don\u2019t deserve to have them after that. But yeah like you said he knew how to say pretty bird for the whole 20 some years we had him and we never made an attempt to teach him anything.",

Observe their eyes and if they pin (get small) they are excited. If they are screaming and carrying on having fun it\u2019s highly likely they will retain information and mimic during this time. Idk about your birds but mine love when I open the curtains so they can sit there and look outside. I\u2019ll watch them and if it looks like they are excited I\u2019ll start saying something repeatedly. I\u2019ll sit in the room or walk around carrying a clicker ready to click and hit it when I hear one of them attempt to say something remotely close and reward. They\u2019ll see one got rewarded and it becomes a competition for them to get food. After awhile they will get the idea and making them say new things becomes a little easier.",

It\u2019s an innately flawed reasoning because all that\u2019s going to do is associate you as a bad thing as well as piss the bird off. We are talking about creatures you are going to need to live with for 30-70 years here. You have a vested interest to keep the thing happy and make it like you otherwise you\u2019ll be spending the rest of your life dealing with a little demon in your home terrorizing you until you inevitably get rid of it to someone that actually cares enough to treat it right. At that point why even get a parrot? Adversives hardly work well on dogs which are domesticated let alone wild birds. OP said it was a lory, I sure as hell wouldn\u2019t want to deal with a lory screaming his head off every day and biting the shit out of you every chance it gets. Not to mention lorys cost thousands of dollars sometimes not including the thousands in equipment to keep them. Last thing you want is your prized bird being traumatized and being ruined.",

Could have been worse though, the parrot could have picked up in the intercourse insetad I suppose. If anything - is the tune that popular?",

Then, when it makes a noise/displays a behavior that is favorable, shower it with attention. in a bird's brain, the louder, more agitated you get, the more they think they are doing a good thing.\n\nI know it's counterintuitive, but this really is the best way to teach a bird - ignore bad behavior, reward good behavior.",

But I am in *tears* that the parrot was like \"aite, new serenade material, LFG.\" \n\nMy advice is teach him something better. Parrots really love the Totoro song, Saria's Song from LOZ OOT, September by Earth Wind & Fire, the Addam's Family theme song -- anything in a higher register and up-beat key. I saw a video of a cockatiel beautifully performing the aria from Mozart's The Magic Flute. Pick a song and play it a LOT, and hopefully he'll latch onto that instead.",

While my roommate is out of town, I'm taking care of his parrot who dwells in our living room, which shares a very thin door with my bedroom. This is no ordinary parrot. This is a chattering lory (same bird as that red one on youtube who goes \"wuewuewue\"). This bird does not shut up. He makes so much noise that I've naturally learned to ignore him after a year of living with it.\n> \n> \n> \n> Anyway, somehow it never even crossed my mind that these parrots learn words and sounds and mimic them surprisingly accurately. Before leaving for work yesterday morning, I made some coffee and sat down in the living room for a bit just relaxing and closing my eyes. All of a sudden, I hear the first few notes of CBAT in perfect pitch and rhythm. I opened my eyes and this little dude is starting me dead in the face. 5-10 seconds pass, and I hear it again. I just grabbed my things and left for work immediately. I had to escape, figuring I'd just find a way to fix this or explain this later. But the more I think about it, the more I realize that I'm just dead. My roommate isn't weird like me and he hates when I say silly things to the bird. When he comes back this weekend, I'm worried he's gonna give a notice and leave.\n> \n> \n> \n> Any advice on how to go about this would be greatly appreciated. I'm sweating as I'm writing this. \n\nwho/what are these? i'm extremely familiar with cbat but not either of those and i can't google right now, but if they're AT ALL similar i want to know.",

Also DO NOT ATTEMPT to encourage to make more pleasing sounds immediately subsequent to an emission of CBAT. Because you could accidentally reinforce to see bad behavior by having the parrot engage in a sound or behavior that it enjoys and that could act as a reinforcing stimulus to the cbat\n\nJust do your best to ignore it and not offer reinforcing stimulus near when it is contemplating or making cbat sounds. \n\nDon't play the song anymore at a volume that the parrot can hear if you don't want it to make those sounds. The parrot probably likes those sounds because they are closer to a pure wave pattern then human vocalizations and therefore are less complex and easier to make and potentially more pleasing to the parrot so it may be difficult to dissuade directly",

He was amazing at it, but I haven't played the song in my house in a few years and he doesn't sing it anymore unless I whistle the end part. \n\nSo yeah don't reinforce it, the bird will forget in time.",

Make sure it's a long version or put it on loop and play it non-stop over the weekend, the next step is very important. Pray to whatever higher power you belive in that the bird mimics the sounds.\n\nAgain sorry but that's kinda funny, best of luck.",
