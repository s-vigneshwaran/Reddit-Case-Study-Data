This is convenient. Evolution loves reusing shit that works.\n\nOr alternatively, in some ancient ancestor, females DID have functional orgasms which would explain all the coordinated contractions and stuff, but in our species it's become vestigial because we're so damn patriarchal LOL\n\nAnyway in the case of the male, the pleasure loop has become very efficiently tied in to orgasm, which is quick and easy and results in kids and therefore sons with similar genes. Women have orgasms because they basically have similar parts so the wiring is all there, but it never really needed to be optimised. So it's all over the fucking shop. Some women cum easily, some take forever and you have to walk a fucking tightrope to make it happen, some can do it multiple times, some get too sensitive, some never get an O at all. It's a total scattergun luck of the draw thing and way more varied than with men..",

For the glans penis, circumcised men reported decreased sexual pleasure and lower orgasm intensity. They also stated more effort was required to achieve orgasm, and a higher percentage of them experienced unusual sensations (burning, prickling, itching, or tingling and numbness of the glans penis). For the penile shaft a higher percentage of circumcised men described discomfort and pain, numbness and unusual sensations. In comparison to men circumcised before puberty, men circumcised during adolescence or later indicated less sexual pleasure at the glans penis, and a higher percentage of them reported discomfort or pain and unusual sensations at the penile shaft.\"",
