But genus homo is not comprised EXCLUSIVELY of their sex, nor is their sex the sum total of their being. Being that humans are complex creatures, to 'essentialise' a person's being exclusively through sex alone, and to debate over the 'validity' of various iterations of human identity is not only blatantly reductionist / sexist, but it is an excellent exercise at bigotry disguising itself as 'concern' or 'rationality'. 100 years ago, the same argument was held for whether or not non-Caucasoid humans were 'human'. Nowadays, the sights are turned to whether or not 'transgenders' are 'human', 'real' or 'sound of mind'. If their lives don't interfere with your capacity to go about your day unimpeded, and if they do not infringe on your own rights and privileges, why should you give so many fucks about what they are, aren't, or should be?",

Why don't you just say what you really mean and quit all of the bollocks? You're plain as day. \n\nCurrent medical science CAN and DOES have the capacity to change one's physical appearance to better conform to one's psychological sense of personhood. Medical science has been doing that since the early 1950s. What you are insisting upon is that for a trans person to be 'real' or 'valid' they must likewise be able to change their BIOLOGICAL SEX, and are further insinuating that they (trans people) are somehow 'deluded' or are 'in denial' of the REALITY of biological sex. The first imposition is preposterous and currently medically impossible (like you said), and the second is an outright fallacy (because they are very well aware of the reality of biological sex. If that shit were not in any way 'real', their attempts to transition OUT of that sex and its associated aspects wouldn't even manifest itself). Why don't you say what you really mean? 'The only time I will ever consider trans people to be 'real' is when they are nothing short of the biological sex they 'claim' to be'? They can be all sorts of 'unreal' to you because of arbitrary parameters YOU yourself set up. But you are neither judge, jury, nor executioner to have the last say on their lives or their 'realness'. You're like a pet owner playing at being a licensed veterinarian.\n\nAs for 'muddying the waters', I cannot expect any less of an interpretation from someone who is obviously not in any way capable of understanding the complexities of gender-identity / gender-presentation / sociological manifestations of gender identity because they're nothing more than a bigoted sophist masquerading as a 'logician'. \n\nFor the record, I am not transgender, so you identifying me as belonging to that minority group is a grave assumption. What I AM is an anthropologist and a long-time volunteer / aid in one of the few clinics in my part of Southeast Asia which specialises in gender / gender transition; so between your reductionist opinions that you're trying to pass off as 'logic' and my experience, I most certainly DO KNOW what the bloody hell I am talking about because I deal with this minority group on a regular basis, along with individuals with credentials, exposure, expertise and work-experience that even I would be in awe of.

You clearly don't understand informed consent in medical contexts. Human identities have correlative relations with sex/gender, however Being a Man or being a Woman says nothing about who you are or what you should be. It only describes your Genus and Sex Role. A man can be \"feminine\" and a woman can be \"masculine\" and as long as they do so in constructive ethical ways there's nothing wrong with that. Body modification is a choice people can make that they have the right to and should continue to do so, however your deluded if you believe that that changes your sex. That's a problem we've yet to solve, that likely requires gene therapy. You have no Idea of just how sexist your being believing that it's rational to judge one based on their born characteristics. Not realizing that this same rationality justifies racism, ableism and many other -isms.",
