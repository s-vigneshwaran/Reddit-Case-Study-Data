I get what you\u2019re saying and I\u2019ve absolutely been to some depressing meetings.  Thing is, for me, the meetings with the lowest \u201cbottoms\u201d (in addiction) resonate the most for me.  Seeing people go from selling their bodies, or homeless, to just being active, stable, and contributing members of society is amazing to see.  I have been to the fancy Beverly Hills AA meetings where you see celebrities and meet doctors and attorneys.  I prefer the dank NA meeting where the guy did a buncha prison time, got out, got a regular job and raised a family and is happy.  That speaks to me far more than a buncha people going to a meeting to show off their new $600 shoes.  \n\nI hate to do this, but there was ONE TIME that I did hear somebody that was a celeb and inspiring.  Let\u2019s just say he \u201cate his liver with fav beans and Chiante.\u201d  THAT individual could share, was incredibly humble and gracious.

It specifically mentions \u201cwe have no dues to to collect or pledges to sign.\u201d  There ABSOLUTELY shouldn\u2019t be any pledges or dues.  A basket\u2019s passed and it usually is heavier from court cards or loose pocket change than actual dollar bills.  All donations are completely optional.  In my 10 years clean and 15 around 12 step I have NEVER witnessed anybody forced into giving money, or signing a pledge.\n\nMay I ask what area you witnessed this?  The regional committee (all volunteer unpaid positions) should look into something like that where people are signing pledges.  It completely goes against the traditions.\n\nEdit:\n\nThere is a program in Los Angeles referred to as PG or the Pacific Group.  People that are \u201caccepted\u201d into PG (anybody can attend, but to become a part of the clique) people do wear suit and ties to their meetings, and as far as I understand are instructed to stop taking psychotropic medications.  I\u2019m not talking addictive or even strong mind/mood altering substances.  I mean people with severe depression being told not to take lexapro, or somebody actively psychotic being told they can\u2019t take Zyprexa, risperidone etc.  this was a long time ago when I heard about it, and I never attended a meeting.  Supposedly the people in that AA group have insane amounts of time \u201csober\u201d (I prefer to use the term clean, it\u2019s far more reaching than sober which reads like it only applies to alcohol for me, hence why I never really attended AA), but it\u2019s the closest thing to a brain-washing you\u2019re describing.\n\nI only ask that you visit a couple of other meetings (try NA) just to see what really happens.  What you\u2019re describing is very worrying and shouldn\u2019t be occurring.  However, I will admit, people don\u2019t end up in 12 step for no reason.  There\u2019s A LOT of shitty people that do shitty things.  50 year old men with 30 years sponsoring and then sleeping with (extremely vulnerable) 25 year old women with 30 days, people running off with a meeting\u2019s treasury, people starting fights and disrespecting the landlords despite the fact landlords are VERY KIND to 12 step and charge a pittance considering they\u2019re opening up their property to a bunch of people with sordid pasts.  It\u2019s the people that twist 12 step around, kinda the same as religion.  That\u2019s why \u201cprinciples before personalities\u201d is something that\u2019s repeated so frequently it starts to drive you crazy.",

Or is no longer using a specific drug or choice, but continuing drinking or smoking marijuana considered success?  From my anecdotal experience, every doctor, and treatment center I\u2019ve worked with (combined it\u2019s literally hundreds) suggest 12 step recovery in conjunction with exercise, getting a job, possibly therapy and medication management depending on the diagnosis of an individual.  Outside of Passages treatment center, EVERY other treatment center I know of encourages and utilizes 12 step recovery as a part of their program.  Do they do that just because they\u2019ve been indoctrinated to do so?  I don\u2019t know, but they all do.  Similarly, every psychiatrist, and physician I\u2019ve worked with suggests 12 step to their patients that have addiction issues.  Again, this is anecdotal, but it\u2019s a very large sample size as I worked in the field for nearly 5 years.  I still work in healthcare but a different aspect of the industry.  \n\nWhat would you define as success when it pertains to addiction?  That\u2019s the first thing we\u2019d need to agree on to see if it\u2019s effective.  Even then the success rate is low as very few people get clean and stay clean the first time.  Relapse is a part of nearly every addict\u2019s story (not all, but probably 95% that I\u2019ve encountered) but if they get clean again and stay clean the rest of their lives are they successful?  Or did that relapse automatically make them a failure?  I don\u2019t really know.  I just know doctors and treatment centers almost unanimously suggest participating in it.\n\nEdit:\n\nI should add, outside of Passages and Faith based programs, but I don\u2019t have any exposure whatsoever to Christian based programs.  I do have some exposure to Jewish based programs in SoCal and they encourage 12 step.  Not sure about the Christian TCs so I can\u2019t say 99% of programs and doctors suggest it.  Probably closer to 90%.",

Everything in that was taken from AA literature, outside of the 12 steps where NA just substitutes \u201calcohol\u201d with much more encompassing \u201caddiction\u201d which I identify with.  I\u2019m not jamming it down anybody\u2019s throat, but abstinence from mind or mood altering substances has saved my life and given me some semblance of happiness.  And honestly.. my brain needed some \u201cwashing.\u201d  Do I buy into everytbing about it, or all the nonsense said by people in there?  No.\n\nAm I powerless over my addiction (when in active addiction)?  Absolutely.  Does my life become unmanageable?  Eventually, absolutely.\n\nYou do you buddy.  But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to just state it\u2019s a cult when the only time people show up at your house is because they\u2019re concerned about you and they walk into a house where their friend is either overdosing or has a gun to their head.  They definitely don\u2019t drag somebody to a compound and have them put on white slippers and drink some purple drink while a comet flies by.  They hopefully get you to detox, and to some meetings.  Just like it\u2019s hyperbolic to say 12 step is the only answer, it\u2019s just as hyperbolic to paint it with a brush of \u201ca dangerous cult.\u201d  In the experience of hundreds of thousands it saved their lives.

They can be found at the beginning of the chapter \u201cHow It Works.\u201d Essays on the Steps can be read in the book Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions.\n\nPDF version >\n\nThe Twelve Traditions >\n1. We admitted we were powerless over alcohol \u2014 that our lives had become unmanageable.\n\n2. Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.\n\n3. Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood Him.\n\n4. Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.\n\n5. Admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.\n\n6. Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character.\n\n7. Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.\n\n8. Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them all.\n\n9. Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others.\n\n10. Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it.\n\n11. Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out.\n\n12. Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these Steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics, and to practice these principles in all our affairs.",

You did some messed up shit so it makes sense that some people would have a bad interaction.  But the NA literature itself (especially in NA, I\u2019m not a fan of the Big Book of AA, it was written by some yuppies in Manhattan in the 30s\u2026 that doesn\u2019t apply to a junkie in the 90s-00s, I didn\u2019t go home and slap my wife after having too many cocktails) is pretty damn good and infallible.  Yes, it mentions god but it nearly ALWAYS says \u201cof our understanding\u201d meaning one\u2019s understanding.  Not Jesus, buddha, Hashem, Allah etc.  people use gravity or the ocean as their higher power.  I used the love my mom and dad had for me.  Regardless of all the awful shit I did they kept loving me despite how little I deserved it.  \n\nPeople mess up religion and 12 step, that\u2019s my opinion at least.

They are unable to process they are not special among their peers, but now they have found an \"upper hand\", a secret that the so-called smart, successful people are too dumb to realize. They are now the enlightened. Just look at their conventions. It's all a circlejerk on how much smarter and enlightened they are to the smart masses. It's no coincidence the ones they targeted are the scientific community. It's NASA behind it, but not the billionaires or the banks or the energy industry, etc. It's quite a serotonin boost when you are surrounded by people who think you are special and significant when you're been lacking that most of your adult life.

You can also use something with a level to level a camera and point it straight at the horizon, the center of the camera will always be above the horizon because the Earth curves away from you. You can get a tool on your phone that does this, and there's a tool that surveyors use that does it. I can't remember what it's called right now.\n\nOne my dad taught me, that's a little less common, is to go to the last cell tower before you enter an unpopulated area, and as you get out of range of the tower, if you increase your elevation, you will be back in range of the tower. That's because the radio waves from the tower goes straight out, and the Earth curves away from them.",

Later versions use the phrase \u201cwild ox.\u201d The original Hebrew word basically means \u201cbeast with a horn.\u201d One possible interpretation is the rhinoceros. But since the Hebrew tow\u2019apaha in Numbers 23:22 refers to more than one horn, it\u2019s likely the translators of the Septuagint used creative license to infer a wild and powerful, but recognizable animal for their versions.\n\nThe re\u2019em is believed to refer to aurochs or urus, large cattle which roamed Europe and Asia in ancient times. Aurochs stood over six feet tall and were the ancestors of domestic cattle. They became extinct in the 1600s. In the Bible, the \u201cwild ox\u201d usually refers to someone with great power.\n\nWhether the re\u2019em refers to a rhinocerous, or an auroch, or some other horned animal, the image is the same\u2014that of an untamable, ferocious, powerful, wild animal. What we do know is that the Bible is not referring to the mythological \u201cunicorn,\u201d the horse-with-a-horn creature of fairy tales and fantasy literature. It is highly unlikely that the KJV translators believed in the mythological unicorn. Rather, they simply used the Latin term that described a \u201cbeast with a horn.\u201d",

Don\u2019t assume things \nAnd for your question, here is what I found after a little research: \n\nThe importance of the parting of the Red Sea is that this one event is the final act in God\u2019s delivering His people from slavery in Egypt. The exodus from Egypt and the parting of the Red Sea is the single greatest act of salvation in the Old Testament, and it is continually recalled to represent God\u2019s saving power. The events of the exodus, including the parting and crossing of the Red Sea, are immortalized in the Psalms as Israel brings to remembrance God\u2019s saving works in their worship (e.g., Psalm 66:6; 78:13; 106:9; 136:13).\n\nGod prophesied to Abraham that his descendants would become slaves in a foreign nation for 400 years, but God promised to deliver them: \u201cBut I will bring judgment on the nation that they serve, and afterward they shall come out with great possessions\u201d (Genesis 15:14). The prophecy came to fulfillment when, many years after the death of Joseph, a Pharaoh came to power in Egypt who afflicted the people of Israel and enslaved them (Exodus 1:8\u201311). It wasn\u2019t until after the birth of Moses that we read God \u201cheard\u201d the cries of His people and prepared to deliver them (Exodus 2:23\u201325).\n\nwe may be tempted to think God parting the Red Sea is a wonderful story of God\u2019s miraculous saving power on display, and leave it at that. However, we would be missing the bigger picture in the story of redemption. The Old Testament prepares the way for the New Testament, and all of God\u2019s promises find their \u201cyes\u201d and \u201camen\u201d in Christ (2 Corinthians 1:20). The exodus from Egypt, though a real, historical event, prefigures the saving work of Christ for His people. What God did through Moses was to provide physical salvation from physical slavery. What God does through Christ is provide spiritual salvation from a spiritual slavery. However, our slavery isn\u2019t like that of the Israelites in Egypt. The Israelites were slaves in Egypt, but we are all slaves to sin. As Jesus said to the Pharisees, \u201cTruly, truly, I say to you, everyone who commits sin is a slave to sin. So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed\u201d (John 8:34, 36).\n\nThe passing through the Red Sea is used as a symbol of the believer\u2019s identification with the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The apostle Paul says, \u201cFor I want you to know, brothers, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea, and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea, and all ate the same spiritual food, and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank from the spiritual Rock that followed them, and the Rock was Christ\u201d (1 Corinthians 10:1\u20134). Paul is giving the exodus from Egypt a Christological reading; he is making the connection between the exodus from Egypt and salvation in Christ. Notice how Paul says \u201call were baptized into Moses.\u201d Just as the Israelites were \u201cbaptized into Moses,\u201d so too are Christians baptized into Christ: \u201cWe were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life\u201d (Romans 6:4).\n\nSo the parting of the Red Sea not only finalized God\u2019s redemption of His people from slavery in Egypt, but it also prefigured the greater spiritual reality of God\u2019s redemption of His people from slavery to sin through the work of Christ.",

Which, it it weren\u2019t so stupid, is almost romantic (for science). In the same way we think of the apple falling on Newtons head, or Ben Franklin in a lightning storm. The passion for learning and discovering is really admirable. But, the difference between the great science legends and this dumbass is the outright refusal,  and/or the belligerent ignorance, of the foundational sciences laid out before them. Literally anyone who paid attention in science class could formulate, at the very least, the concepts by which to disprove flat earth theory if not refute the points outright. BUT, it\u2019s much easier to contain educated thought than uneducated. Uneducated thought can roam free, grow and multiply because it has no bounds, no definition, and answers to no methodology. It\u2019s easy to see why in many uneducated clusters, learning and schooling seems like mind control.",

When he returned to the starting point he was surprised that some poles looked higher than each other despite them being made the same. Ultimately he concluded that evaporated water was changing the refraction index and bending the light slightly (You can do these sorts of experiments with glasses of water at home, look up refraction experiments).",

Even if there are minor perturbations of the surface of the water, the experiment is still valid as long as the perturbations on average are much smaller than the expected resulting difference in height. It is actually very easy to drop a board in shallow water and then measure the surface of the still water to the hole in the board. Maybe not millimeters accurate but again that's not necessary for the experiment they were doing.\n\nOf course with proper high precision surveying equipment they could do the same thing with more accuracy, but high precision survey equipment is expensive and requires training to use. Their experiment was still valid",

You'd have to make sure you're basically at the same relative height on both sides. You'd also have to make sure your equipment is perfectly level.\n\nThis is a much more complicated and delicate experiment than it seems so it would be good if the video went into detail about how it was setup.\n\nUltimately it's also pointless - you just need to climb a tall enough structure and observe the horizon. People in antiquity knew there was a curve because ships would eventually dip over the horizon. Probably for that reason many flat earthers believe there's a curve to the earth but it's still not a sphere - which is what thinkers in antiquity thought as well.\n\nNow, given that we have actual pictures from space, and about a thousand different data points, we know the earth is spherical, so they're still wrong.",

The main takeaway being that it is basically just a fandom and really, it's unclear how much these people *really* believe it so much as they have situated themselves within this community and made all these 'friends' who will shut them out if they don't. (That is to say, they all necessarily have to make a show of believing it, and it's clear that this is a source of ~~happiness~~ something for these people, but the wider point seems to be more about the stuff surrounding it)\n\nIt is pathetic and a bit sad. They are mostly just lonely misfit types who have a hard time with life and relationships. There are a few who seem more like outright grifters but for the most part, it's people who don't have a lot going on in their lives, discover a 'thing' that excites them and proceed down a rabbit hole to chase the feelings of purpose and community it fosters. \n\nWhich shouldn't read as an endorsement. The whole thing is dumb. It is mostly harmless taken on its own, but it dovetails with other crank 'ideologies' that are less so.",

Basically idiots all sort of congregate together and so if you get a couple beers in them they're gonna start talking about the Jewish space lazers.\n\nMoreso I think flat earthers and all of these conspiracy theory nutters have a common thread of 'I found the truth and that makes me special.' you're taking losers who can't accomplish anything in their lives and suddenly telling them they've stumbled upon this truth that nobody else believes? Suddenly they can really do a deep dive into it and make it become their identity and it doesn't really cost anything. They get to do nothing but feel like they finally did something. That's why things like flat earth and 9/11 truthers and anti Vax people all absolutely refuse to accept anything but their chosen delusion. If you suddenly were to get them to believe it's all a lie, they're back to being a nobody. And they can't face that. So they simply don't.\n\nThe problem is that whereas a few people here or there were making money off these fools. Now it's a mainstream billion dollar industry. Qanon and trump easily roped a bunch of chumps into literally committing treason. They died for Facebook memes. There's big money made in controlling these sorts and that's only going to get worse. If you think qanon was the end its not. There just needs to be someone else who can make money or sway political discourse for the next iteration to present.\n\nWe won't come full circle until birds aren't real becomes an actual belief and not a satirical one.",

However, science itself, the artificial discourse edifice, not nature or reality, could be considered a belief system, except it's purpose is to describe the real ever more accurately and isn't afraid to rewrite itself",

As part of the launch sequence, there was a system to detect if the rocket was falling over sideways, and if so, to trigger the emergency escape system to pull the manned capsule off the top of the rocket.  The launch was aborted and everyone sat on the pad for a while.  But the gyro that was meant to sense wether the rocket was tipping over was still running.  As the earth rotated, it eventually tipped the gyro to the trigger point, the capsule was blasted off the top of the rocket, and the rocket exhaust led to the rest of the fully fueled rocket to explode on the pad.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_7K-OK_No.1",

It\u2019s similar to the situation where people throw about \u201csociopath\u201d, but are referring to antisocial behavior that does not necessarily demonstrate a relevant disorder, to say nothing of the abuse of \u2018psychopath\u2019 (not in use for a while clinically to my knowledge in current classes) or \u2018insane\u2019 (which is a strictly legal term emphasizing if someone is in touch with reality and rational enough to understand a trial/court proceedings/control their own actions). \n\nPart of the problem lies: there are so *many* incomprehensibly selfish people out there, and so many offspring of said people, that with no words to describe the situation adequately, people reach for psychiatric terminology. Perhaps in part to cope: it\u2019s hard to believe such people are just part of normal baseline human tendencies, at times.

There\u2019s no need to reach any farther and we don\u2019t need to dig into the DSM V to start explaining away behaviors that we don\u2019t personally like or agree with.\n\nThe problem with tossing terms like \u201cbipolar\u201d, \u201csociopath\u201d, \u201cpsychopath\u201d, \u201cnarcissistic\u201d, \u201cschizo\u201d, etc. around casually is that it just perpetuates the stigma surrounding mental health in general. It makes it seem as if you must be \u201ccrazy\u201d to display any sort of negative behaviors. There must be something *wrong* with you because it isn\u2019t possible that a *normal* human could act this way. That sort of labeling isn\u2019t helpful, and it\u2019s especially damaging for individuals that are struggling with legitimate mental illnesses because it gives a negative connotation to diagnoses that are often necessary for proper treatment. You tell somebody that they\u2019re a \u201cschizo\u201d and it\u2019s like you\u2019re telling them that they are subhuman, so what does that mean for someone who is genuinely struggling with a mild case of paranoid schizophrenia, or BPD with delusions?",

(or religion for that matter, it's a damned cult) They seem to assign different definitions to words and often capitalize them like 'Belief 'and 'Truth'  and the new one is 'Facts'. Their version of the truth is set in stone That's how we end up with adults legitimately trying to do these experiments, but if they encounter objective reality like this they treat it like a test of faith instead of a reason to change their mind about something. (Except for that Mike Hughes guy, he dead.) That's why they so often double down. It's a horribly fucked up reverse version of 'teach them not what to think, but how to think'.  If they were taught 'religion logic' from a young age they will probably think like this forever. The result of this type of educational warping (at least in America) seems to turn out flat earthers, creationists and far right conservatives.",

Think about it this way, you don't understand the world you live in, you have not accomplished much in life, you're constantly downplayed by people who are better off than you in some way or another (Socially, financially, professionally, you name it), how do you manage to keep on living knowing the fact that you're a deeply flawed human being without any kind of external support? \n\nYou create a convoluted conspiracy theory, and suddenly all of the world's faults are the doing of hidden cospirators, you know this and as such are intellectually superior to your peers, it can be used to explain anything you don't really understand, gives you a life purpose to \"uncover the truth\", and anyone and everyone who has accomplished something you couldn't must have bought into the conspiracy. \n\nIt basically is a way to forget you're a failure.",

It is a *survival mechanism.* They have to believe that they are worth enough to justify staying alive - to justify *not killing themselves.* They feel worthless. But this gives them the boost they need to stop from overdosing on oxy or acetaminophen or pulling the trigger. This gives them the boost that keeps them above water. They are warriors in a community of like-minded warriors fighting the Great Evil, trying to free humankind from eternal enslavement. If that's not a reason to live, nothing is... Literally. *If that stops being their reason to live, there's nothing left to replace it.* That's it. This conspiracy is their life support system, and if you pull the plug on it, they - their ego, their self-worth, their identity - will die. It is a survival mechanism. It is unconscious. It has roots that cannot be pulled out without destroying the entire system. If this idea goes, so goes the person.",

It's blocked by fog. And for smaller distances, you can see the other side. That's a reason why the experiment is flawed, not proof that no experiment was done.\n\nYou don't have to prove to me that the earth is round, I know that. My point is that flat-earthers are like inquisitive children in primary school who don't understand a rule (about nature) the teacher says so they make it their mission to prove that someone must have gotten it wrong. Not because they despise the teacher. \n\n*An example would be of a child learning in school that birds lay eggs, mammals give birth to live babies, and now are confused about the platypus. They're not necessarily dumb or trying to purposefully go against the whole class.*\n\nExcept they are now 40 years old, and have been sheltered (for one reason or another) from the rest of the world. And now that they're trying to find out more, everyone ridicules them. Of course they'll start hating the rest of the world.",

When the pandemic started I mentioned this to my gf and told her that this has to be one of the biggest factors to why there are so many no maskers. But many won't admit it and instead they'll start using other reasons to justify their no-mask position, and they started believing that this was truly the reason and they end up using all types of stupid and silly arguments to reinforce their position but now they're so invested they can't go back.\n\nBUT, from time to time they'll get a sniff out of their mouth (maybe their partners will tell them, maybe they get so close to a mirror and smell their own breath or something), and the facade will suddenly fall: \"oh yes this is how it all started, it's that smell\".\nYes they'll get a small reminder that this whole thing could have never been a reality, if only they had enough courage/means to go and consult a dentist etc.",

If they're a hassle and they recommend removal, I'd say go for it - I haven't had strep throat since they removed mine when I was 11, and I'm going on 36 now.

The smell of the strong garlic, etc. will even come out in your sweat and potentially even in your urine.  Garlic can take up to 2 days to metabolize out of your system.\n\nChanging your diet might help considering this.  Garlic has reported health benefits though so pick your poison.  \n\nI haven't confirmed it but I think you might be able to help to accelerate metabolizing the sulfur/sulfide out somewhat by doing intense cardio exercise, \"sweating it out\".\n\n[https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2014/06/21/323999613/science-of-stink-blame-sulfur-compounds-for-your-garlic-breath](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2014/06/21/323999613/science-of-stink-blame-sulfur-compounds-for-your-garlic-breath)\n\n>Garlic is delicious. But if you consume enough of it, its stench can repel not only vampires but any person within a 5-foot radius.  \n>  \n>What's behind garlic breath that makes it so offensive? In a video, the folks at the American Chemical Society and the chemistry blog Compound Interest lay out the chemicals responsible for the odor.  \n>  \n>Chopping or crushing garlic releases the compound allicin, which then breaks down into four other smelly compounds. The most mischievous of them is allyl methyl sulfide, which can linger in your body for a long time. It not only causes your breath to go rank, but as it seeps into your bloodstream, it also gets into your sweat and pee.  \n>  \n>It can be incredibly difficult to get rid of the stench once you've ingested this chemical. \"Humans and animals are exquisitely sensitive to the most tiny amounts of sulfur compounds,\" says Eric Block, a professor of chemistry at the State University of New York in Albany, and the author of Garlic and Other Alliums.  \n>  \n>It makes our mouth water, but it makes our breath stink. Flickr  \n>  \n>Once you metabolize these compounds, the smell goes away, Block tells The Salt. But that can take a while \u2014 up to two days, though it varies in each person.",

Completely clean mouth and no garlic breath for a little while.  Swallow garlic in a gel cap if you really want to science it.   You start digesting it and it passes into your lungs from you blood.  \n\nIf you eat a bunch of garlic before donating blood the recipient will get bad breath.  \n\nDehydration and your diet can affect breath.  The stink may be coming from bacteria in your gut.  Could be bacteria someplace where your immune system is fighting it.  If you drink more water you piss out chemicals that your liver rejected instead of circulating them around to your lungs.  More water is usually good for people so even if it has no effect on breath it is probably a good idea.",

All of scientists would do this. That's the point of science. That's how we advanced medical science, even as we accidentally killed so many people in the past with wrong treatments. Honest people would also do this. We are talking about rules they themselves made before hand. They just chucked out the result they got and denied it happened.",

For example, when somebody says that the CDC says that the vaccine isn't effective, you ask \"Is the CDC telling the truth?\" instead of \"OH, NOW YOU BELIEVE THE CDC WHEN IT CONFIRMS YOUR NARRATIVE!\" \n\nThough, that is frustrating and is evidence of cherry-picking on their part, it will only cause them to dig their heels in. They want to think they are smart, so asking them to explain to you the logic is something they are eager to do and, if they are to overcome the conspiracy theory, they want to think they did it via their own reasoning instead of somebody proving them wrong.\n\nI say \"they\" but we all have that desire to be seen as intelligent, eagerness to describe things we are passionate about, and instinct to be stubborn when somebody is mocking our beliefs.",

Obama's administration gave a hacker guy blanket immunity and an endless budget as long as Trump lost in 2020 and that Democrats could take over. The guy became Q and seemed to be attacking Dems but he actually channeled the hate of child sex trafficking to ensure no Republican would ever listen to what Dems would say. This meant that instead of secret or coded messages, Dems could speak out in the open with the knowledge that Republicans would do the opposite. This has worked out well by killing off Republican social media influencers and leaving more Dems available to vote. Dems don't care if Republicans get the vaccine but they know the more they keep talking about it, the more quickly the Republicans will die off.",

There are many religions in Christianity not all of them are the same but like everything else people generalized so it all becomes Christianity even though its not all the same.\n\nIn conclusion if your intentions are to discredit the Bible you will find it, if your intention are to truly understand it you will seek it.\n\nYou will always find what your looking for depending on the intentions you have of it.",

I'd encourage you to watch the whole thing even though it's rage inducing.\n\nThere is a scene where the main guy Mark Sergeant got some super expensive gyroscope.  I can't remember the details but basically if the world was flat, there wouldn't be drift but if it was round there would be a 15\u00b0 drift.\n\nTurns out (surprise) that there is a 15\u00b0 \"they can't account for.\". Anyway, the flat earthers are at a party and he's talking to some conference goer who asks him how things are going in the experiment. He says something along the lines of \"Oh we can't release these results.  People would be mad at us until we come up with an explanation.\" (Paraphrased)\n\nThe premise for every one of these people is that NASA, Neil deGrass Tyson, etc have all entered a conspiracy, and are so called hiding the truth.  They don't realize that they are doing the exact same thing to their followers.\n\nIt's ironic that they don't see their own hypocrisy.\n\nNo amount of data will be enough for them. I'm convinced that you could take Mark Sergeant up in a shuttle, show him that the world is round, the sun is millions of miles away.  He'll still say the world is flat because he's become their king and he has so much influence that it would be detrimental to him socially if he says that the world is round.",

One lady was feeling physically ill when a 5G relay was placed near her house. She didn't want to sell the house, so she borrowed 5G-repellant curtains from an organization looking to bring people information about electricity and 5G. The curtains were free to borrow but cost thousands to buy after you've had a free taste of them. \n\nThey interviewed the swiss company that made the curtains and the CEO was talking up a storm about the emerging market and people waking up to the truth. The documentary folks did bother testing the curtains, hoodies and other fabrics and at the very least they did do what they advertised, effectively blocking signals.",

They are smart enough to control for important variables, but then when they get results that disagree with their beliefs, they come up with any reason to justify why the data is wrong.

Of course it\u2019s true for any object even a baseball but it does affect a bullet enough to matter. Back to the airplane example though - pilots do in fact have to \u201cpush the nose down\u201d very slightly, or the auto pilot does , because they are following an isobar that is constant pressure curve which is approximately a level curved path. Also if they flew straight as in a tangent to the ground they would be climbing against gravity , burning more fuel and steadily gaining altitude. From that perspective they \u201ckeep the nose down\u201d by keeping throttle set. Gravity keeps the nose pulled Down for you",

The water tension \"pulls\" it into a \"bump.\"\n\nLiterally this is how they explain it, and how they approach the physical world.

They said that \"with God all things are possible\" This wasn't an argument so much as I was really just asking questions. I wasn't really trying to get a meaningful answer from many of them and I didn't.\n\nHonestly thought it has been kind of a underground joke this entire time but no, they believe. I can't talk with people that believe in their subject matter despite all evidence to the contrary. At that point I'm arguing faith which, of course cannot be argued with.\n\nThat's just bonkers IMHO.",

Mostly because of wrong socialisation, education and consuming wrong media. \n\nE.g. Fox news is a great source to learn that not every media is good media.

Typical scientific thinking goes like this:\n\n* I believe [something] might be true\n* Based on that, I should be able to predict things about the world if I do certain things\n* Therefore, I will conduct A B C experiments to measure whether that's true or not\n* And furthermore, if X Y Z happens, then it means my hypothesis can't be true.\n\nIt's that last part that they will not accept.  They won't even postulate the conditions, or the evidence, that will prove it wrong.  Instead, they invent explainations that you *cannot* prove aren't true (proving a negative).\n\nA *great* example of scientific thinking is the invention of the Periodic Table.  Based on the principles of atoms, protons, electrons, etc, it was hypothecized that there SHOULD be certain elements on the table that haven't been discovered yet, that would have such-and-such properties when discovered.  These were: gallium, scandium and germanium.\n\nThey were *dead right*.  Not only did those elements exist, but they had the correct properties, and their atomic number fit precisely in the gaps.  The theory had *predictive* value.  Whereas previous theories of matter (\"the four elements\" and stuff like that) had zero predictive value.  And, if that \"hole\" in the periodic table was never filled, or if that element had completely different properties than what was predicted, then the theory was probably incorrect (falsifyable).",

Or, alternatively, are they open to the idea that some piece of evidence could prove it wrong?\n\nFlat-Earth is one of those unfalsifyable things.  When you press it hard enough, they start to come up with explanations like \"you can't go to the edge of the earth because there's a giant ice wall that's patrolled by secret government agents that will kill anyone who sees it.\"  Or \"anyone who knows the secret is reprogrammed.\"  Or \"The Clockwork is in a different plane of reality that can never be observed.\" (all of these are actual paraphrased \"answers\" btw)\n\nSimply put, if you ask someone \"what evidence will you accept that will convince you that X isn't true?\"  And their response amounts to \"there is no evidence that can prove X isn't true,\" you're dealing with someone not rooted in rational thought.",

All you need is an A-frame ladder.  8 foot works best.\n\nWait until sunset, set up your ladder, and the moment the sun dips below the horizon, scramble up to the top of your ladder.  You'll see the sun again.\n\nThis works *literally anywhere on earth.*  And the only reason that's true is that the earth is round.\n\nEdit, I just wanna add in here that the way flat earthers view the sun/earth relationship is that the sun is a big \"spotlight\" in the sky, that is constantly circling above the earth in a circular pattern, but always at a fixed height.  Their explanation for why the sun \"goes down\" is that it's simply getting too far away to see!\n\nSo if THAT is true, then why is it that changing your Z-axis makes you able to see it again?\n\nOops.",

This implies, somehow, that there are light and dark \"bands\" of light emanating from the sun, and not a continuous, unbroken sphere as you can just... observe.\n\nFor another, if light worked in that way, then the experiment in the video *would have worked.*  It didn't, because light does not \"curve\" in that way, unless you start getting black holes involved.\n\nLiterally just watch the video that OP posted.  It's exactly what you're saying, and they proved it doesn't work.\n\nE:  another *very* simple way that you can observe this is not how light works:  The shadows cast from tall buildings.  They're straight, in all cases.  If light from the sun curved in that way, then the shadows of skyscrapers would have a noticeable \"fun-house mirror\" effect to them, and would be blurry even on sunny days.",

What you're saying is 100% true. There's an incredible amount of crossover between Flat Earthers and other conspiracy theorists. In fact I would go so far as to say that Flat Earth is the gateway conspiracy that leads to all this other stuff. I would be very confident in saying that if you took any random conspiracy and tried to trace the origins of it all the way back to the first influential person that started it, you would most likely find that they are a Flat Earther as well. \n\nThink about it, if you can allow yourself to be convinced that you've been lied to your entire life about something as basic and fundamental as the shape of the goddamned planet you live on, then it wouldn't be too difficult to let yourself be sucked into other crazy ideas.",

In this case only one of the two statements is correct at any given time for the same location\n\nThe better question would be: is anyone entitled to claim wrong facts? No, if its wrong its wrong, no amount of free speech will change that\n\nNice krieger pfp btw, hes just the best (thats an opinion again lmao)",

I think we all to some degree feel that way, but these people have been pushed for whatever their reasons, to the brink and they fell off.   \n\n\nFell off their 'flat earth' and it's kind of sad.",

But since they *knew* it was flat, they decided \"heaven energies\" must be affecting the gyro, and decided to put it in a \"zero gauss chamber\" (which failed) and then in a \"bismuth crystal chamber\" (don't know if they ever tried that one). You can't reason someone out of a position they didn't reason themselves into.\n\nBy the way, there's another really good video on this subject. It's [In Search of a Flat Earth](https://youtu.be/JTfhYyTuT44) by Dan Olson. Not only does it have footage of what may be the most beautiful proof of the curvature of the earth, it's a great examination of the flerffer mindset, and how the way they think makes them vulnerable to all sorts of nonsense.",

I flew for the Navy for a while and now fly for another government agency, and it's such a unique experience to see the curvature of the Earth. \n\nMaybe these people just can't comprehend the size of Earth, it's pretty amazing when you fly around it, it's fucking massive. \n\nThe oceans are even more amazing, I've flown pretty much everywhere in the world except for a few areas, and I think how vast the oceans are is what surprises me the most.\n\nYou'll fly and see nothing but water, and your brain is like, it'll show up at some point, but it's just crazy when you're out there and see nothing but water.\n\nI always imagined how insane it would have been to be on a ship a few hundred years ago, and just going in a direction for months, hoping you find land, must have been an amazing feeling when you finally see it.",

He pretty much says that his whole life is dedicated to the cause, so even if the earth is round he wouldn't tell his followers. Total disregard for science and only in it for money I guess.",

Not only does it repeatedly expose the leaders of this movement as 50IQ frauds, but there is a scene where they pool money together to buy a $20,000 Laser Gyroscope to prove that the earth is flat. Obviously, they prove it's a globe. ON camera they have a discussion about how they can't let anyone know, before going on stage and pretending that they proved it was flat with the Gyro, or  that the Gyro was faulty or something, despite it being highly accurate state-of-the-art equipment.\n\nIt's amazing that Flat Earthers even exist after that Documentary went online.",

Being in a secret club that knows the real truth gives them that. Same for anti vaxxers. They always claim that no one speaks about (insert national news story), or that they know the real truth that no one wants to talk about.\n\nThis conspiratorial thinking is a real problem as it prevents people from actually discerning the truth by invalidating something just because its what everyone else is saying. Not to say that something is inherantly true just because everyone thinks that way, I am just speaking about the disposition to dismiss stuff because it is the common thought on an issue.",

It was a very interesting watch, but not for the reasons I was expecting it to be.\nIt's not a documentary about science, well, not really. It's more about the people, the psychology and how people can come about to believing these kinds of things.\n\nIt shows that these people are not unintelligent at all, they're not stupid people make them out to be. They're actually surprisingly clever, and show clear interest and capability. This video kinda shows that, they devised a clever experiment to try and show their theory, in fact, they showed multiple in the documentary\n\nWhat they are, is they are clever, interested and capable people, that have been unfortunately been dogmatized, isolated, and compounded into this world of belief. It's very much like religion, or as it's put 'like a student who is told they are the ones who are wrong, instead of the teacher, when they fail to understand a subject'\n\nThey get few steps down the wrong path, and through everyone telling them they're an idiot and wrong, they continue to get pushed down the path further, and more isolated until they find like minded people they can connect with and relate to; other people of they belief. At that point, it's where they feel their life belongs, it's their home culture where they feel appreciated and people take them seriously.\n\nAt that point, losing belief mean losing family, friends, and identity. So they'll do all they can to contribute and ratify their belief. To them, there's nothing in it for them in losing belief, because nobody would care if they did. But people do care within their culture.\n\nThese people don't need insulting, they don't need to be told their stupid and to pushed further into the corner. They need real empathy. They need to see that there's still a world out for them outside to be accepted into, and need empathetic helpers to help with with them, not against them.",

Not knowing how this turns out, I hope he is able to realize what he has discovered. That would be some real understanding. If not then it is too bad that he can't be skeptical about his own bias. \"Thus the duty of the man who investigates the writings of scientists, if learning the truth is his goal, is to make himself an enemy of all that he reads, and, applying his mind to the core and margins of of its content, attack it from every side. he should also suspect himself as he performs his critical examination of it, so that he may avoid falling into either prejudice or leniency.\" Ibn al-Haytham",

Look at the shoreline on the opposite side of the water while standing up, then slowly get closer to the ground. You will see that the water will cover more and more of the shoreline. This is because the curve of the water (and the earth) is blocking the shore. If the earth was flat, it wouldn\u2019t matter what elevation you were at, you would see the shoreline just the same. In this experiment, the elevation of the land doesn\u2019t matter because the water is the thing that is proving the curve and water is always completely level.",

It's just second nature so we don't call them experiments because we aren't out to prove the world is round.\n\nAnyone who does astronomy can prove that the Earth most definitely is not flat. Anyone who has sailed, flown, or even used GPS are already unconsciously confirming that the Earth is round. You can't fly a plane using a flatearth map. Flatearth maps distort the actual real life longitude/latitude lines. Either time is being dilated, or the travel times between longitude/latitude lines are miscalculated. Either way, everything works fine on a round map.\n\nAnyone who has looked to the horizon knows that there is a curve. We know things sail/drive/fly beneath the horizon way sooner than they would if the Earth flat. Same thing goes for Everest. Tallest thing on Earth yet I can't see it, not even with my telescope or from my office building.\n\nEasiest way to prove the Earth is flat is actually simple and affordable. Get a powerful telescope, bring it to high location and see if you can see ANY mountains from the other side of the country. Someone on top of the Appalachians should be able to see the Rockies if Earth was flat and you had a powerful enough telescope. My telescope can see the rings of Saturn, the moons of Jupiter, etc. So you shouldn't need that powerful of a telescope to see something that's only ~1,500 miles away.\n\nAsk any commercial pilot if they believe the Earth is flat. They don't. Because they know their plane has to make certain adjustments for the curvature of the Earth. Same goes for so so so many other professions. Either every single one of those professions are in on it, AND all the equipments are making odd adjustments (like my telescope), or the Earth really is round like everything suggests.",

But on the other side you cannot just take something for granted. \nYou know that stars produce light but you ignore every little mechanism that is involved in that system. If someone says that stars don't produce light but they are just lens in the firmament and you try and prove them wrong you NEED to know how those little (big) bastards work. Saying \"someone else studied them so I just need to show you their work\" is not proving anything.\n\nI've seen countless arguments built up like this. None of them worked. I even tryied to reason in the same manner to no avail before I started my physics degree. \nThey are not dumb for not beliving something. They are just scared becouse they have a belif that the whole world is against. And when you, or other people try to \"convert\" them with your 150 IQ article, all you are doing is convincing them that they are right and you are part of the conspiracy.\n\nThat's right you don't need to prove yourself anything. But when you go out and try to reason with these individuals you absolutely NEED to know what you are talking about.",

When someone goes against what the majority assumes to be fact, the onus is not on the majority to prove that what they believe is correct. The dissident voices have the obligation to prove why they are choosing to believe something else. \n\nAs a physicist, you should know this as this is how scientific belief functions in every field and how facts and knowledge work in general. To use your earlier example, when people came along claiming babies actually *could* feel pain and believing that they couldn\u2019t was wrong, the people who believed babies didn\u2019t feel pain didn\u2019t have to prove their side of the argument because that was the commonly held belief, that was the assumed science at the time, so the new voices had to prove their beliefs that babies did feel pain was true and they did so, and then that became the scientifically held view on the subject. \n\nIf someone comes up to me and claims that the stars in the sky don\u2019t produce light, I am WELL within reason to point at peer reviewed scientific studies that prove that they do and say \u201cyou\u2019re wrong and this is why\u201d. I don\u2019t need to go and get an astronomy degree so I can come back to the argument and prove the other person wrong, not only is that fucking stupid, it would mean every time I disagreed with someone I\u2019d have to pause our argument to go and study some new random scientific field so I could prove my point to someone who wouldn\u2019t even understand what the fuck I was saying. The onus is not on me to prove that stars produce light, because we work on a system of trust in our society and we put that trust in scientists who work to objectively prove what things are fact and what are fiction. The onus is on the idiot who\u2019s just decided that stars don\u2019t produce light to prove how he came to that conclusion and what evidence he had to support that that somehow simultaneously proves him right and disproves the millions of hours of collective research done on the subject. If someone came in to your work and told you, \u201cnewton was wrong, I believe gravity actually pulls upwards\u201d it\u2019s their job to prove why they think that, not the other way around. \n\nIt is not the coffee makers job to know why we collectively agree the world is round and not flat, it was part of some scientists job to prove that long ago, and everyone looked at their proof and said \u201cwe\u2019ve looked at the thoroughness of your work and can\u2019t prove you wrong, so this is what we will believe to be true\u201d. \n\nNow the coffee maker, the mattress salesman, the fire fighter, the music teacher can all go \u201chere are the scientists of the past who proved the earth is round beyond any degree of doubt, they tested it over and over and they came to the conclusion the earth was round, look at their work if you want to know why they came to that conclusion, but I\u2019m going to trust they were not lying to everyone and will believe the earth is round too\u201d because it isn\u2019t their job to know why the earth is round so they can prove it to someone who doesn\u2019t believe them. \n\nThis doesn\u2019t even engage with the fact that flat earthers have proof contrary to their belief all around them so reasoning with them is a lost cause to begin with. If anyone with a flat earthers level of understanding of a topic tries to argue a point, they are already too intellectually bankrupt to even entertain the idea that they would be open to listen to sound reasoning.",

As well as claiming that if you want to prove something you need to understand the basics of the subject I suppose.\n\nNo! It isn't! But what we're not going to do is pretend like this is what you've been doing this whole time. The way you've been talking this whole thread, you've completely disregarded the purpose of scientists in a functioning society and have instead decided thatA). Scientific facts, laws and constants are somehow open to debate and anyone regardless of training or prior knowledge is allowed to call them false with impunity and no burden of proof\n\nand\n\nB). It's completely reasonable to expect the layman on the internet to know and be able to prove already proven and accepted scientific facts and in a way that \"convinces\" the dumbest section of our society; conspiracy theorists, that their beliefs are wrong.\n\n>All I want is for people to stop going agaist those flat earthers, spamming articles and formulas both party don't know anything about.\n\nThis is how the world works! How do you not see this! Neither of them have a deep understanding of it, so they both look to the ones who do; scientists, to prove it for them! And then you go with the side with more proof! So far globe earth has 1000's of years of research and evidence based proof backing it up, flat-earth has nothing. And yet you're still \"Both sides-ing\" this shit like there is any level of dignity in even entertaining conspiracy theories.\n\n>Every time the flat earther was more convinced than ever that he was right and the other person had accomplished nothing but enlarging his ego.\n\nYou're so fucking close to getting it... just carry the thought another 2 feet or so and realise what that means... If flat earthers can look at all the proof we have for earth being a globe, and can't produce a single piece of evidence to support their theories of earth being flat, does that make them people just trying to honestly and openly question the world we live in? Or does that make them ignorant, egotistical morons not worthy of acknowledgement or debate?\n\nHonestly, the way you completely ignore how science is supposed to work in a society is beyond mind blowing and you strike me more as a flat earther wearing the mask of a physicist than any kind of actual scientist. The way you demand people debate facts, \\*not opinions\\*, facts, is so anti-intellectual and intellectually dishonest that I don't know how you're so oblivious to it.\n\n>Am I wrong to want this to stop? Or am I obliviously steeping in anti-intellectualism?\n\nThis \"stops\" when people like you stop entertaining flat-earthers and stop pretending like theres a legitimate discussion to be had. Stop acknowledging their idiocy, don't reward them for trying to disprove a well known fact and stop pretending like it's anyone elses job to teach them how idiotic they are.\n\nThe way you think, debate, and forgive deliberate stupidity is what gave rise to things like the anti vaccine movement.
