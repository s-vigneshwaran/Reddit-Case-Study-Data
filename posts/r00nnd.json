All I know is that we pronounce it wrong in the UK, and then the yanks pronounce it in a way that's even more wrong, they call him \"van go\" like he's a van that can go very fast, or something\n  \nThe way we pronounce it in the UK is kinda like \"van gock\" but at the end of the \"gock\" you make a sound that's like coughing up a bunch of phlegm. And then kinda do an \"F\" sound at the end, but not really an \"F\" sound, just kinda close enough\n  \nAlthough some brits pronounce it like they pronounce the British surname \"Gough\" which is probably related to the Dutch name van Gogh I'd bet. Like there's a famous cricket player called Darren Gough. The way we pronounce his second name, that's how a lot of people pronounce Van Gogh. The surname \"Gough\" apparently came from Wales originally. So maybe the name van gogh also came from Wales? I dunno. There's a lot of names that exist in every European country, that all have their own unique twists on them\n  \nAnd the Welsh surname \"Gough\" comes from the word \"coch\" which means someone with red hair. Van Gogh had red hair. So it's probably actually quite likely that his ancestors came from Wales, if that's the case.",

It's like the kinda discussion you have at a party when everyone is drunk and/or high and is tired from dancing, so you all sit down, smoke a joint, and have discussions like this\n  \nI did find an article that claimed Van Gogh was born in Wales, but the article was written like an Onion article, so I don't think that's really true. \n  \nBut yeah. There's often some very strange examples of shared culture and language over different countries\n   \nLike there's an area of Spain that are all Celtic people. So they play the bagpipes, they wear kilts, they act like Celtic people, because they are. And they have their own dialect of Spanish. And of course there's parts of France that are Celtic or they're Britons because they're from Britanny. UK culture is a mixture of like 7 different foreign invasions from different countries where they took over the whole country for a century or so. Like germanic tribes invading, the Anglo-Saxons. And France invading a bunch of times. And vikings from Denmark also took over the country for ages, and we had a thing called the Danelaw which is the basis for our legal system or something like that.\n  \nAnd we share a lot of things with Denmark. Like the England football team (and the cricket team) wears the Danish coat of arms as the badge on the shirt. The famous \"three lions\". It's literally the Danish coat of arms. That's how intertwined we are with them\n  \nSeriously take a look: [Danish coat of arms](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-P4sJQgxMZfM/VhE3Kl2zoFI/AAAAAAAADJE/Tsl26Tv53rE/s1600/1000px-National_Coat_of_arms_of_Denmark.svg.png)\n     \n[And here's the England football team 3 lions badge](http://pictures-of-cats.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/England-football-badge-850x1012.png)\n   \nSo yeah it wouldn't even be surprising if he actually did live in Wales for a time. Because it seems like just about all of Europe has invaded or emigrated to the UK at some point in history. We're a big melting pot. But it's hard to know specifics about Van Gogh's life because he was so unknown when he was alive, so nobody wrote these sorts of things down \n   \nI could end up rambling about all this for hours, so I'll stop now lol",

They don't exactly drop the last syllable but they say it very quietly so it sounds like it's been dropped.\n\nThe most infuriating part of this made up \"capicola\" is that if it were an actual Italian word (which it isn't) it would be pronounced ca-PI-co-la, with emphasis on the \"pi\". It's even harder to get \"gabagool\" from that. The word \"capocollo\" comes from _capo_ (head or top) and _collo_ (neck), because that's what part of the pork's body the meat comes from, and it is why the emphasis is on the penultimate syllable",

I have worked for New York Italians in a pastry shoppe and the second-hand embarrassment/cringe was out of this world, especially this one day.\n\nI'm very far from Italian, I'm not even white-passing or Euro-passing at all, but I did learn some basic Italian as part of my uni requirements. I also took an Italian Diction course, too. So even though I barely passed the language course, I passed Diction with flying colors -- and I *definitely know* how to at least read and pronounce Italian.  \n\nOnce upon a time I worked part-time at a pretty well known Italian bakery from Staten Island. (It was not the original location, but another location they made). And one day an older gentleman comes into the store, admiring and ogling all the pastries and breads and such. He actually starts speaking in Italian, but me being very non-Italian-looking, he doesn't direct it at me, and I'm not confident enough to butt in and say anything to him. I'm simply a cashier, anyway. I just package the things he wants and ring up his order.  \n\nWell, the baker of the place -- a stereotypical New York Italian -- gets hailed over by the older Italian gentleman. The older Italian gentleman personally compliments him and the store saying that everything looks and smells great, beautiful, thanks for the pastries, etc.  \n\nWhat does the New York Italian baker say?  \n\n*What the fuck does the New York Italian baker say?*  \n\n***\"Gracias.\"***  \n\nI wanted to fucking die",

There's just so many subtle shots of different mundane events that show them to be terribly uncomfortable and just shows the utter disappointment they've developed for what was probably a fairy tale land to them in the US. A good scene I liked was the shot of the filthy bathroom in the restaurant they agreed to meet up with the Italians in. A far cry from anywhere they would've met on Mulberry Street, Artie's place, or really any white tablecloth Italian spot they would've eaten in New Jersey.",

For most countries, if a person wanted to make a reverse charge call (collect call) to their home country there was typically a free-phone number they could call. But for Italy, they had to do it through us for some reason.\n\nSo I'd say a good proportion of our international assistance calls were Italian reverse charge calls. You'd get an Italian come through, ask to make a reverse charge call, give you the number, then we'd call and when they answered (\"Pronto\"), we'd announce \"Good afternoon, this is the United Kingdom calling, will you accept the charges?\". At this point the person calling would usually talk over me saying (in Italian) \"hey mum, it's me, just say 'yes'\".\n\nAnyway, me being young and eager to please (and stupid) thought that \"Pronto\" must be the Italian word for hello. So on one fateful day I decided to go that extra step, give a real world class service. An Italian wanted to make a reverse charge call, I rang the number and when they picked up they said \"Pronto\", at which point I said \"Pronto, this is the United Kingdo...\"\n\nBoth my caller and the answerer started pissing themselves laughing.\n\nI still cringe about it to this day.",

She grew up on Seinfeld and friends and stuff, I never watched them but I guess that's why she liked it?\n\nAnyway I remember this like it was yesterday.  Out of the bodega right after she said that come these three disgusting New York Italian guys and one of them, in the dirtiest accent I could imagine, shouts \"Heyo, did you see that broad with the tits in there?  God I'd love to fuck her plump ass\" so I turned to her and said \"really? That's what you like?\" It was like straight out of a lame sitcom.",

I was guessing that when you wrote 'capisce' you were actually referring to the pronunciation 'capeesh', is that right? And it looked like you and the other poster were kind of talking around in circles because you accidentally stumbled upon the actual Italian word *capisce*.\n\nIf you were actually referring to the word pronounced 'capisheh', that would be surprising because I've never heard anyone use that form of the word to ask 'do you understand?', always 'capeesh'.\n\n>Also I don\u2019t mean to confuse you or anything but capisce has an e at the end which is feminine plural.\n\nThe 'e' on the end of *capisce* isn't feminine plural. It doesn't have a gender because it's a verb. It's the singular third person and can refer to he, she or it. If you're talking about multiple men, women or things it would be *capiscono*\n\n> Because I remember my professor said there were some words where the basic rules didn\u2019t apply and that some words were automatically masculine when referring to both genders.\n\nI think you're referring to a different grammatical concept entirely: plural **nouns** that involve both genders. For most grouped nouns, if they're all male you have an 'i' ending like *ragazzi*, if they're all female it's *ragazze*, but if they're males and females you just say *ragazzi.*",

What is considered \"Italian\" nowadays comes from the Florentine variant, which had already been populised 500 years earlier by poets such as Dante Alighieri (which shows how old our language actually is, as a student in school today can perfectly understand what Dante wrote 700 years ago without adaptation). There are many dialects in Italy that are recognised as official languages, but my what I'm trying to say is that any Italian will understand almost everything another Italian is saying while speaking his regional dialect; dialects from the south generally are more obscure than the ones in the north, and a person from the far north will have some issues if someone from the far south speaks in his dialect with a heavy accent, but in your specific example there may be some specific words I don't know but I'm fairly confident that I could understand 95% of your friend's Roman dialect without much trouble (I'm from the far north of Italy)",

Generations born after WWII speak this dialect almost exclusively, and there are very few people that speak in the way that \u201cNJ Italians\u201d do - except of course for the NJ Italians, who do not speak Italian but have passed down certain pronunciations and habits - like dropping a final vowel sound - and who now sound like no one left in Italy.\n\nEdit: I had my dates wrong! It is late 1800s. However after WWII, when education became widespread (not immediately directly after WWII obviously) is when it became more widespread.",

They made primary education free and compulsory back in the 1860s. Big war one was a push along the way because soldiers came from across the country and needed to communicate. Literacy (and therefore knowledge of standard Italian) was about 60% before the great war. Although there were still large disparities between the rich north and poor south.\n\nThe reason for the particular sound of Italian New Jersey accent was this sense of community. Most of the Italian immigrants in New Jersey came from southern (peninsular) Italy, and there are some similarities in these dialects. By speaking more dialect (home language) than standard (school language), it reduced the social distance and reinforced the ideas of community. But since they didn't all speak the same dialect, compromise is made and a new form emerges.\n\nAt the same time, there was a lot of stigma for speaking foreign languages so parents stopped teaching their kids Italian (of any kind) but words related to Italian food and culture stuck, since there wasn't an English equivalent. So you get this situation today of very particular pronunciation of certain words.",

Especially in school, consider that when a kid attempted to express themself in a dialect they were told it was wrong and were corrected, especially for a good chunk of the twentieth century. Dialects are still spoken, somewhere more than somewhere else, somewhere they're slowly dying out or they've evolved in a hybrid of the dialect it was spoken one hundred years ago and standard Italian (because they're languages and as all languages they do evolve and incorporate loans). Many younger people will claim they can understand it but cannot speak it. I think the revivalist wave of regional languages is stronger in other countries, more than in Italy, where most people fundamentally don't care.\n\nThe rest you wrote, simplified, but that's true.",

Like, if you're talking to a like-minded coworker about something that happened in your office earlier, and the conversation goes like:  \n  \nAlice:  \"So then Bob said that Jane lost the paperwork.\"  \nBob:  \"But...but Jane hadn't even been hired yet. How could she lose the paperwork?\"  \nAlice:  \"Yeah, I know. So I pointed that out to Bob, but he insisted. And then I even pulled up her hiring papers and showed that she wasn't working for us yet.\"  \nBob:  \"So then he realized his mistake, right?\"  \nAlice:  \"No, he just kept insisting. Even though we had the contracts, and the paperwork, and the records.\"  \nBob:  \"Man, what a weird hill to die on.\"  \n  \nSo, in this situation, would Alice think Bob was a weirdo for using the expression? Or does it just come across that when used confrontationally?",

I mean, this whole post is a perfect example: the video cuts off without any doubling-down. There *is* no dying on a hill here whatsoever, but everybody keeps talking about him dying on a hill. So I'm not really disagreeing with you, just trying to get a feel of how live usage is different than written usage.  \n  \n> For someone who claims to not be a native English speaker\n\nNo, you got me wrong. I ***am*** a native English speaker, it's just that I've been living overseas for the last 25 years or so. Thanks to movies, TV, the internet, YouTube, etc., it's not like my English has gotten rusty, but sometimes there are expressions people use in real life that are seldom used in print/movies/TV, and vice-versa.  \n  \nFor example, my wife got into American Idol a few years back, and everybody was saying \"blessed\" \"blessed\" \"blessed\" all the time. [Use of that term has just exploded over the last 20 years](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=I%27m+blessed&year_start=1950&year_end=2019&corpus=26&smoothing=3), but until seeing American Idol, I had no idea, because it's almost never used in books/articles/movies/TV shows, it's only in conversation and social media, and I don't read much social media. Those new evolutions and shifts in language fascinate me.   \n  \nAnyway, thanks for your insight, it's appreciated.",

And lets not even start with the oo being an u.\n\n I actually found someone saying it with an italian accent here at the start, and you can clearly hear the difference between it and how it was said in the Sopranos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SNoryubiwU",

The list goes on.\n\n Yeah, whatever your manual says, i can assure you, as a native speaker of one of those languages, that we would be able to tell the difference in the g as we'd say it, and how the Sopranos do, even if it's not that big.\n\n> Perhaps you mean to say the double o spelling isn't particularly romance?

These speakers most certainly have an American English accent when they say these words. However, their accent does not explain the more noticeable differences between [gabagul] (avoiding the double Os, because in IPA its a [u]) and [kapocollo]. \n\nFor instance, no English speaker is going to see the word \"capo\", and pronounce it [gapo], or [gap], cutting off the last vowel. However, [k] > [g] is a common change in Romance languages. For a prominent example, look at how Latin \"cattus\" became \"gatto\" in Italian, or \"gato\" in Portuguese/Galician/Spanish (weirdly enough, in these cases, it became [\u0283] in French, see the word \"chat\", but we don't like to talk about French). This [k] > [g] change happened in some Napolitan words but not for some Florentine words. Also, we see this tendency to end words with a consonant in Napolitan, quite different from standard Italian, which likes final Os, As, Es, and Is. \n\nMy general point is that Italian-Americans, in most of these cases, are not butchering (Standard/Florentine) Italian words. Rather, they are using legitimate Napolitan words. They may pronounce the Napolitano words with an American accent (approximating the sounds, instead of pronouncing them 100% the same), which is what you're getting at, I think. But the most significant differences in the varied pronunciations are due to the fact that Florentine Italian and Napolitan are not the same, and not because these speakers* are Americans.\n\nIn the end, I don't think we're actually disagreeing about much.",

Medisterkaker is just pork whereas karbonader is more like the \"frikadeller\" (not heard that name before) as they often have onions in them.  That the Swedes actually boil these makes me ill, but fair enough. We fry them in a frying pan until they have a nice sear and then finish them off in the oven.\n\nIf you were to explain to someone what karbonader or medisterkaker is - it's not that far off from hamburger. It's minced meat formed into round patties or a bit more ball like.\n\nHere's a picture of traditional norwegian karbonade: [https://images.matprat.no/pp7tfb7ypx-jumbotron/large](https://images.matprat.no/pp7tfb7ypx-jumbotron/large)\n\nOften served with mash potatoes, brown sauce and fried onions.",

It's just okish tasty cheap meat that is usually the last thing to be eaten after the good meat is gone. Meanwhile the rest of the world is like \"look at German identity\". Half of us prefer Kochwurst or Chorizo any day tbh.",

A lot of the debate surrounding the pronunciation of Italian words among Americans has to do with the culture of Italy 100-150 years ago, when many Italians were immigrating to the US. Italy had (and still has) so many differences from region to region within the country itself, and these regional differences reflect in the differences of dialects. Italy was much less unified than it is now, so there were major differences in pronunciation across the country. \n\nSo Betty\u2019s great grandma from Milan pronounced prosciutto one way, but Johnny\u2019s great great grandpa from Calabria pronounced it another way. \n\nWhich is why you may experience a heated debate among contemporary Americans with Italian heritage regarding how to pronounce certain Italian words. \n\nSource: I\u2019m a server in a high end Italian restaurant where I\u2019ve been instructed to pronounce things the way contemporary Italians would say it. \nEx: For Bruschetta we say broo-sket-ta instead of broo-shet-ta (which is the way I had actually heard it pronounced my whole life until I started working at this bougie Italian restaurant).",

          "text": "/pone/ can not be a single syllable due to the sonority principle. Certain sounds are more sonorous than others, meaning they resonate more and can be held for longer. The hierarchy goes:\n\n* Low vowels\n* High vowels\n* Approximants\n* Nasals\n* Voiced Fricatives\n* Voiceless Fricatives\n* Voiced Stops\n* Voiceless Stops\n\nA syllable can consist of up to three parts, the onset, the nucleus and the coda. The nucleus is the only part that has to exist in any syllable and is generally formed around a vowel, but if a vowel can't be found it will be formed around the most sonorous consonant (approximants and down).\n\nThe onset of a syllable generally is a consonant due to the maximal onset principle, which states that the onset of a syllable tries to grab as many consonants as it can while generally adhering to the sonority principle. This is why we have onset clusters like /p\u0279/, /kl/, /k\u0279/, /\u03b8w/ and so on. If we look at these onset clusters we can see that /p/ is a nasal and /\u0279/ is a approximant, /k/ is a nasal and /l/ is a approximant and so on.\n\nThe coda is the final part and generally consists of whatever consonants can't fit into following onsets.\n\nThe nucleus is always the most sonorous part of a syllable with the onset rising in sonority to towards the nucleus and the coda falling in sonority after the nucleus. Wikipedia uses the word \"trust\" to illustrate this, so I will borrow that example.\n\n/t/ is a stop, /r/ is a fricative, /\u028c/ is a mid-low vowel (/\u028c/ is also known as a strut vowel as it is the phonetic realization of \"u\" in words like strut or trust), /s/ is a fricative and /t/ is a stop. So we see the word \"trust\" starting at low sonority and rising in sonority towards the nucleus /\u028c/ and then falling in sonority from nucleus.\n\n/pone/ would be in violation of this rule, since /o/ and /e/ are both mid-high vowels and more sonorous than the nasal /n/. Therefore a single syllable /pone/ would violate the sonority principle.\n\nI am currently revising for a exam in English phonology so I took this as a opportunity to revise on syllable structure. I know nothing about Italian phonology other than what is transferable, however the sonority principle and hierarchy is generally considered universal among languages. There are probably instances where these are violated, but I doubt you would find violations in English or Italian that are persistent. In all likelihood what you are experiencing are slightly different vowels like  /maskar\u02c8p**o\u02d0**n**e**/ vs. /m\u00e6sk\u0251\u02d0r\u02c8p**o\u028a**n**e\u026a**/ where one has two monophthongs and the other two diphthongs. This could maybe make it seem like there are two syllables instead of one.\n\nEdit: I also just noticed that the stress in those two variations are two syllables from the back while English generally places the stress on the third syllable from the back. There might be some fuckery going on with syllable stress that makes it seem like a syllable is being washed away.",

It's genuinely how they speak and it's not as if it's some butchering of the language like people in this thread or the OP in the video are making it out to be.\n\nIt's derived from a dialect where certain word pronunciations are passed down through generations. My parents don't speak Italian but their parents did, and they've always heard it pronounced \"cappacoal\". Because of that, they pronounce it \"cappacoal\" and now I do too.\n\nI think it's honestly a bit of a rude thing to downplay the heritage of Northeastern Italian-Americans because there are people unable to admit that there is an actual reason for them pronouncing the words \"wrong\" as compared to modern Italian. You're trying to shame people into forgetting their sense of self and community because you're left out or something. Doesn't sit right with me.",

Where the fuck did they get that idea from?\n  \nIt was extremely satisfying when that idiot trump devotee became the US ambassador to the Netherlands and all the Dutch journalists kept asking him why he said the Netherlands had no-go zones. And he just kept saying \"fake news! Fake news!\u201c and tried to move on to other questions from other journalists. But then those other journalists kept insisting he answer the first question, they said \"this is the Netherlands, and in the Netherlands you have to answer questions.\"  And he just looked like a deer in the headlights.\n  \nThey even showed him a VIDEO of him saying that the Netherlands had no-go zones. And that was after he'd called the claim that he ever said that \"fake news\". And so after having seen the video, he started to claim *WITHIN THE SAME INTERVIEW* that he had never used the term \"fake news\" even though he'd literally said it in that interview less than 2 minutes before.\n  \nHere's the interview with the guy who showed him the video of him talking about these fictional \"no-go zones\" and him still denying it: https://youtu.be/SZ4RX5PsnFM\n   \nAnd then here's some clips of the 2nd interview with the room full of journalists insisting he answer the question instead of deflecting: https://youtu.be/lOEI6hYZe6Y",

Even if they don't descend from English people. They could be descendents of Asian people (like they're born to Indian or Pakistani parents who emigrated to the UK), or they could be descendents of African people, or they could be descendents of Italian people etc etc\n    \nThey're still English. We don't use racist segregation terms like \"African-American\" in the UK, where it's implied that they're African first, American second. If someone is British, they're British. If they're English they're English. If they're Scottish they're Scottish. Etc. There's nothing else. You're either British or you're not, it's a binary. \n     \nHow the fuck would someone who's born and raised in England be anything other than English? Just because they're black, that doesn't mean they're not English. They're not \"African-British\". Explain how the fuck someone who's literally never even been to Africa is somehow \"African\" first, English second?\n   \nWe seem to be a much better melting pot than Americans are. Americans still use these idiotic racist segregation terms for some reason even though so many of them like to pretend that racism is over. \n     \nIf someone is born and raised in the US, that means they're American. Regardless of their genetics.\n    \nLike why not be proud of your own culture instead of trying to glob on to someone else's? America has an incredibly rich history of culture and art and food, that's so good that it's spread around the entire world, and other countries want to be American. Like you invented jazz, and blues, and rock music. You have a huge and diverse range cuisines, many of which are absolutely incredible. Everyone wants to copy your movies, you basically invented an entire art form from scratch singlehandedly when you invented movies. \n\nWhy not be proud of all of this? Instead of cosplaying as Irish every St Patrick's day, as it Irish people are strangely exotic or something \n   \nThe awful thing is that if you ever saw a black Irishman, you'd probably insist that they're not Irish, even though they were born and raised in Ireland. I've seen this literally happen. There's a famous Irish bodybuilder who makes meme videos so he's spread all around the Internet, and has been posted to reddit tons of times. And there always seems to be a debate in the comments as to whether he's Irish or not. He was born and raised in Ireland. That means he's 100% Irish. Not \"African-Irish\" for fuck sake. \n   \nIf he moved to the US permanently, and had kids and grandkids etc, those grandkids would have just as much right to call themselves Irish as all the other Americans who cosplay as Irish people every year. But those kids would probably instead be called \"African American\". Either way though, they're not African, and they're not Irish, they're American, because they're born and raised in the US. \n     \nWhich really just proves how idiotic this whole thing is. It's just fucking weird, we think you Americans are really odd for this stuff. I guess when you live in Europe, Europeans don't seem so exotic. But either way. \n     \nBe proud of your own culture. Don't try to take other people's culture that you have literally nothing to do with. There's a shit ton of things Americans should be proud of. Why not be proud of those, instead of pretending you're something that you're not?",

You people claim to be so tolerant yet you\u2019re so incapable of accepting a harmless cultural practice that has arisen from our unique history as a nation of immigrants. Why is that?",

Lots of these are food related because they wanted a taste of home, but had to make due with local ingredients. And thus new traditions were born.",

Which they aren't. If you didn't grow up somewhere, surrounded by that culture, you probably aren't culturally from there. Even if you grew up in a tight knit diaspora community it is likely to be culturally different from the \"motherland\", growing further apart and developing their own cultures each year as they are isolated.",

The children & grandchildren of immigrants (and to some extent immigrants themselves, especially if younger) did not speak it often enough to learn and remember the masculine, feminine, or correct singular/ plural endings on words.

Huge. Sure they eat more seafood, but that's not a \"staple\" in the way pasta is.\n\nFor another thing, Italian food changed when it arrived in the US in the exact opposite of the way you describe. \n\nWages were far higher and food far cheaper in the US (hence the big draw for immigration), so these immigrants that previously had been only able to mostly afford simple pasta were able to eat huge helpings of meat and cheese.

It's there, just not as pronounced and comical as it is in the American \"Motzer-rell-aH\" The 'll' combines with the 'ah' to soften it in the Italian language.

That would make you a bigot. Dave might not understand it as clearly as his older family members, but that in no way correlates to his value on the culture.\n\nPoint being that treating cultures like a block-chain that expire after time passes and can't be held together after a generation or two is ludicrous and, in the end, is how culture is lost in time as holidays become forgotten by the children of their founders. A main responsibility all culture share is to ensure it is passed down as time goes on - not close doors and shrug because \"enough time has passed for it to become irrelevant\". Culture is not a piece of fruit, it doesn't expire unless you make it expire.\n\nWe're a nomadic species, I can celebrate an Italian holiday if I want regardless of my or my kids location, just like John can celebrate Feast of the Assumption if his grand-father from Nairobi raised him on it, and wants to share the good memories and purpose with his own children in another decade, even if he does a thing or two slightly differently. Regardless, OP's attempt to say mozzeralla was already better than 90% of Americans pronunciation and closer to Italian than his second variation. i.e see Dave above. \n\nYour comment is just low-tier race bait and missed the mark, good try.",

Or appropriate to correctly pronunciate people names or places especially in Spanish.  However Spanish speakers make no attempt to drop the accent when pronunciating an English speakers name?  I've even been corrected with french people correcting my pronunciation of certain things like places or foods but when they have a heavy accent on comparable English places or foods or whatever they look at you like you're an idiot or make no attempt at all to pronunciate it correctly in English.  What's the reason for this?",

For example, the south had Calabrian which was heavily influenced by Greek. The North had Piedmontese which is related to French. And Sicily had lots of Arabic-sounding things. Just a few examples. \n\nThis went on until 1861 - 1914ish; during this period, Italy unified under the Northern Italian government and forced a \u201cstandard\u201d Italian national language (Tuscan). This government also did a lot of shady stuff to non-northerners, basically annexing them, and imposed heavy taxes and other regulations. Southern Italians fled in huge numbers \u2014 many fled to NYC, for example. \n\nIn short, those old dialects stuck around in the USA while dying out in Italy. Check out this quote:\n\n\u201cI grew up speaking English and Italian dialects from my family\u2019s region of Puglia \u2026 and when I went to Italy, very few people could understand me, even the people in my parents\u2019 region. They recognized that I was speaking as if I was a 70-year-old man, when I was only 26 years old.\u201d \n\nSo Italian-American is not at all like Standard Italian. Instead it\u2019s a construction of the frozen shards left over from languages that don\u2019t even really exist in Italy any more, with minimal intervention from modern Italian.\n\nEdit: typos\n\n[source ](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/how-capicola-became-gabagool-the-italian-new-jersey-accent-explained)",

Neapolitan, Calabrian, Sicilian, etc. are sill living breathing languages spoken by millions in Italy.\n\nLanguages evolve a lot, and these regional dielects no doubt have too, but to assume that people in the US preserved the language somehow is wrong, it evolved *at least* as much.\n\nYou can hear the American accent in the way they pronounce Italian words. That has nothing to do with their original ancestors, that comes from people in the US and the fact that their mother tongue is now English.",

It's a salad of various backgrounds, with local cultural and religious influences.\n\nIn my neighborhood, most grandparents and great-grandparents came over from Poland, Italy, and Ireland. We have a lot of Polish shops now run by second and third generation. People identify themselves by their parish, despite maybe not going to Catholic church since elementary school. I've got a lady on speed dial that sells perogies out of her house, and white borscht is a holiday staple for my family.\n\nTen blocks north and it's most Dominican and Peurto Rican. Ten blocks south and you'll hit Chinatown, where it's mostly Cantonese. Go a half-hour east and you'll find some of the best pizza you've ever had in your life. Go just south into the Pine Barrens and now you're in hunting territory.\n\nIf you go two hours west, it's a lot Germanic and Swiss background. The restaurants and markets change, and you're going to get a different variety than what's available in my neighborhood. Two hours more and it's once again much more Polish and perogies dominate.\n\nNorth Jersey has one of the largest Indian diasporas in the world. Detroit has the largest Muslim population per capita. BBQ dominates the south but it's not as big of a deal up here. Cubans shaped Miami to be a very different city from say, Boston. Tex-Mex from Texas, and LA has a whole culture of it's own.",

Italy was not unified until the latter half of the 19th century, so the language was spoken with pretty varying dialects across regions. A lot of southern Italians emigrated to the US back then, and kept their dialect alive (as opposed to the Tuscan/Dante dialect). One flag of such a dialect is leaving off the last vowel sound. What he is doing in this video as well as why Italian-Americans pronounce grazie as only two syllables. There are other traits of this dialect as well that can be shown from the pronunciation of capicola as gabagool. Anyway, linguists studying early Italian will actually go to America to listen to these people talk as opposed to going to the south of Italy as the dialect is no longer present in those regions.",
