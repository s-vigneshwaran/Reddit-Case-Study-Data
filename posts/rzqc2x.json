Look carefully at his right hand grab the mace and stop when the other cop goes by. He then puts it away. WTF!\n\nEdit: yes I know they were spat at. But as a cop you're above that shit. Two random people on the street? Whatever, I understand them fighting after. But a cop? So called peacekeepers and the other guy is literally bound to a stretcher? Pathetic. He would have also maced the paramedics as others have pointed out to me!\n\nEdit 2: To all the people telling me how spit can transmit covid, give it a rest. This wasn't about worry of catching covid. You don't walk up to someone who you think has covid, place your hands near their mouth nor lean over and place your face near theirs.\n\nFor those saying it's assault. It still doesn't justify the action. The guy was subdued, strapped in and situation handled. This was a cop who felt disrespected and gave out his personal form of \"justice\". This is not professional behavior and its the bare minimum of anyone working in a public job expected to handle. No one is saying they deserved being spat at nor can't feel angry. (well I'm not at least).",

And say all this did happen, why would the cops need to return Fire when getting the gun from the guy is extremely easy since he is strapped fucking down? Lol. Spitting can be considered assault, but you aren\u2019t going to be getting away with assault yourself because spitting at someone is not threatening enough to earn you the right of defending yourself.

Also, as a medic you can use more meds and with whatever protocols your city or state uses without constantly having to ask a doctor for permission or having a doctor stand over you telling you to do this or that. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing more crazy then getting to a scene of a traumatic arrest with only you and your partner until back up arrives. But with that being said, working in EMS is extremely dangerous because you do work in an uncontrolled environment .

You can definitely YouTube some pretty nasty videos of how some first responders treat people. On the flip side, I've had scenes where the police and Deputies helped me more than my own partner. \n\nEmergency services as a whole really gets hyped as this bad ass, God-sent field when the reality is that we really are some of the most entry-level interventionists for our respective fields. There are a lot of people in our area of work that simply do not belong here. It's why we struggle to be seen as professionals and achieve better pay and respect, and quite frankly it's why social work has been considered to integrate with us. And I agree! Bc more professional fields like social work take ethics and human dignity seriously, whereas emergency services is about who can go back to the station with the baddest story to tell. \n\nI hate to criticize my own \"brothers and sisters\" so harshly on it, but it's the truth.",

He acted in a way that exceeded what he was allowed to do, and that\u2019s why he\u2019s suspended and awaiting charges. \n\nHe went straight to abuse. Abusing people is not what police are paid to do. That\u2019s what creates victims, and payouts - because cops get all physical and don\u2019t show basic self-control. They don\u2019t follow the law. \n\nYour repeated threats of violence *yourself* don\u2019t go unnoticed. Have you reflected on how not acting violently actually shows more strength of character?",

This is relevant to you specifically addressing firefighters, so bear with me. A significant number of agency, both rural and urban, have a similar setup.

I\u2019ve worked with hundreds of firefighters, paramedics, and EMT\u2019s in my career that have been cross certified and work both side.

That's like responding to someone throwing oranges at you with a gun. You are never going to be in the right for seriously injuring someone because \"they spit on you\". And no court would find you innocent either. Literally all these fragile man-children posturing in this thread have no idea what the real world is like but man do they love supposing they know exactly how it works. A real tough self assured person wouldn't respond violently to being spit on, they'd know that was a last ditch by someone desperate and reacting strongly is exactly what they want. Responding with restraint is much much more mature and thought through than letting your lizard brain take over and assault someone.\n\nSorry, rant over. This thread is just exhausting",

Oh that doesn't matter, could be in music, they just need one to teach. \n\nAgain, the academic system is strange.\n\nEdit: the Dr.Med does not typically signify advanced medical knowledge either. It's usually more about systems or in an academic setting. For advances medical knowledge that's typically done through the type of residency program and a further specialized fellowship.",

MD program makes them a Dr. MD stands for Medical Doctor. \n\nYou wanna get more confused, Nautropath Doctors (which don't go to medical school) graduate from their undergraduate program (which you can just enter out of highschool) as an ND.\n\n\n>Undergrad is all the fields of study before that program that you need to take to qualify for an M.D. program. \n\nYes. But the MD program is an undergraduate program. You just need an undergraduate degree to enter it. You can't get to it out of high-school or as a mature student. The admissions requirements for the undergraduate degree is doing very very well in another undergraduate program. It isn't like a Masters program either (which is typically 2 years after an under grad). It's an entirely separate undergraduate degree in the university setting.",

It makes it more difficult to successfully sue police officers, but it doesn't forestall lawsuits entirely. And in cases like this, in which the officer was even suspended by the department for these actions, it becomes a pretty tenuous defense.\n\nQualified immunity is a huge issue, but its existence doesn't have anything to do with the criminal/civil split in our justice system.",

When you argue that you were acting in self-defense after killing someone, you aren't denying that you killed them. You're instead saying that the killing was justified because you acted in self-defense, and you should be punished (read: convicted and sent to jail) because of the killing.\n\nQualified immunity is the same sort of thing. It's a defense that public servants can use when their actions are challenged in court, essentially saying \"yes, I broke the law, but I broke that law for a justified reason based on the duties of my job and I shouldn't be punished.\" It's a public policy choice that we've made that government officials shouldn't be punished personally when they do something in their role as a government employee *and* that is part of their duties for that job. \n\nOne common misconception about qualified immunity is that it's unique to police officers. It isn't. All public employees have access to the defense in situations in which it applies.\n\nSo, to take an absurd example, pretend there's a man-eating bear that runs across your yard with your state-employed animal control officer in hot pursuit. Both run right across your private land without stopping to ask. The animal control officer is breaking the law by running across your yard: he's trespassing. He wasn't invited onto to your property, nor does he have an easement or right-of-access, and yet he did so anyway. If you tried to sue him for trespass, however, he would likely defend against the lawsuit by claiming qualified immunity. He was acting in his role as an animal control officer by chasing the bear, so even though he broke the law and trespassed, he shouldn't be punished. It's good public policy to let him off the hook; we want to be able to catch evil man-eating bears quickly, and if every animal control officer had to stop and ask permission when chasing such a bear, it would make their job impossible!\n\nThe important question for qualified immunity is whether the public servant was acting in the scope of their job. That above animal control officer couldn't argue qualified immunity if he was selling crack, for example, because being a drug dealer is *not* within the reasonable scope of his job duties. Where it becomes an issue is with police officers, as they are one of the few public servants that will sometimes have to engage in violence as part of their duties. That's why we hear a lot about reforming qualified immunity.",

This is a grapevine story mind you so forgive me if I am getting the details wrong.\n\nPoint is, they (the state? The cops?) would not pay for the 50k in damages. Would qualified immunity work in this case as well Since they could just say it was part of the job since there was a felon in the house?\n\nIt was completely absurd and overboard to go to the lengths they did and they cost this woman her home.\n\nAnyways, thanks for the reply!",

Grand jury proceedings are held without the defendant being present and the defendant doesn\u2019t have a right to know about its proceedings. \n\nIn countries outside the US (and Liberia), a preliminary hearing would be held in front of a local judge, who decides the same issues. \n\nAround half of US states now use the preliminary hearing model, which is an adversarial hearing where the defendant has a right to be represented by counsel, but all states have laws allowing the use of grand juries.

The detention center I worked for taught a lot of behavior and life skills (RBT, CBT, Anger reducing techniques, etc) and a large part of the mindset was teaching that if you do something you EARN a positive or negative consequence naturally. For example, if they volunteered to help clean they earn rewards like coupons for snacks, movie nights, etc. positive behavior=positive consequence. On the other hand, a perfect world natural consequence to spitting on someone would be catching a charge and other natural consequences in the facility such as losing free time, not being able to watch a movie etc. All of that to say the natural consequence of spitting shouldn\u2019t be met with assault.

The first time my daughter threw  back her head and hit me square on the nose (it was an accident and I did have a black eye and they watered for a long time.)\n\nI won\u2019t ever forget that moment. Instincts kicked in and I went into fight or flight mode. I didn\u2019t pick it but it was fight. I wanted to lash back at her. But, a voice in my head said \u201cshe is just a baby, it was an accident. We don\u2019t hit or hurt babies or children\u201d (no matter what) I have never been a hitter. I rarely raise my voice even though I was in the army.\n\nBut that one moment is the one time my dna was set to fight and I had to override the program.",

It hurt like crazy and the initial instinct is like \"RAWR HOW DARE YOU!\" lol\n\nLike if this were two random adults and someone spit, yeah they are fighting no doubt. But I think officers should be held to a higher standard. They aren't just some Joe Schmoe walking down the street.

I talked to a police officer who was incredibly depressed after being hit by a wrong-way drunk driver while driving a van of prisoners to court. One of the incarcerated victims had died.

Poor discipline seems rife from the videos though those are importantly a minority of cases.  \n\nThe US does kill more of its citizens than any other western nation.  Could that be their fear of 2a? Could it he that Americans are just more likely to turn on cops and  attack them? Could it be that police are just shittly trained?\n\nThe BBC states that US cops kill 3 Americans every day.  \n\nAnd here is the per capita graph showing where you stand against other developed nations:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/KfBKnCw.jpg",

They Riverside cop left behind a 10 year old son and and 4 year old daughter.  \n\nThe dudes, one a marine veteran, had zero connection to anything Dormer was pissed about.  The LA times did a deep investigative story that had Dormer\u2019s friends and ex-girlfriends giving quotes that he was highly unstable.  He was a nut.  But somehow glorified by morons here for killing innocent people, who played zero part in his imagined grievances.",

And convictions of cops has had even less of an upward trend than suspensions and terminations. \n\n30 years ago it took a dozen officers beating the life out of Rodney king to get media coverage, and they spun it successfully as riot fodder for thugs. Then it took an unarmed hot dog vendor getting shot a million times by NYPD, which had no possible spin angle. Less than that level of violence got zero coverage. Now, we see literally every traffic stop, every smack, every punch, every harassment no matter how large or small, played up in the media. This will be one of the most important legacies of the iPhone. \n\nThere will continue to be outrage from a vocal minority but these people\u2019s days are numbered and they know it. And the good ones are the ones who will suffer most. Most of us know there is something seriously wrong with the criminal justice and law enforcement system, and typically social paradigm shifts don\u2019t just pop up and fizzle.

They'd also have to fire most if not all the current cops, certainly any cop with over a couple of years of experience - they're probably hopelessly steeped in the current hideous \"cop culture\" and unsalvagable.\n\nWhich makes fixing that part of the US quite the challenge.",

They went for the thin blue line bullshit instead.\n\n>To recognise always that to secure and maintain the respect and approval of the public means also the securing of the willing co-operation of the public in the task of securing observance of laws.\n\nThe cops should have been #1 in line to support marijuana decriminalization when they saw the public saw through the government's bullshit.\n\n>To recognise always that the extent to which the co-operation of the public can be secured diminishes proportionately the necessity of the use of physical force and compulsion for achieving police objectives.\n\nHence why we have no public cooperation in this era of armored transport vehicles and no-knock warrants.\n\n>To seek and preserve public favour, not by pandering to public opinion, but by constantly demonstrating absolutely impartial service to law, in complete independence of policy, and without regard to the justice or injustice of the substance of individual laws, by ready offering of individual service and friendship to all members of the public without regard to their wealth or social standing, by ready exercise of courtesy and friendly good humour, and by ready offering of individual sacrifice in protecting and preserving life.\n\nNah, selective enforcement is the name of the game.\n\n>To use physical force only when the exercise of persuasion, advice and warning is found to be insufficient to obtain public co-operation to an extent necessary to secure observance of law or to restore order, and to use only the minimum degree of physical force which is necessary on any particular occasion for achieving a police objective.\n\nNah, let's beat and choke nonviolent offenders and execute fleeing suspects.\n\n>To maintain at all times a relationship with the public that gives reality to the historic tradition that the police are the public and that the public are the police, the police being only members of the public who are paid to give full-time attention to duties which are incumbent on every citizen in the interests of community welfare and existence.\n\nYeah that's definitely not how we've structured jurisprudence anymore. Especially with qualified immunity. If they were like the rest of us they'd buy liability insurance like doctors and engineers.\n\n>To recognise always the need for strict adherence to police-executive functions, and to refrain from even seeming to usurp the powers of the judiciary of avenging individuals or the State, and of authoritatively judging guilt and punishing the guilty.\n\nA lot of them think they're Judge Dredd.\n\n>To recognise always that the test of police efficiency is the absence of crime and disorder, and not the visible evidence of police action in dealing with them\n\nAs you can see, we're a long way from \"police\" and strayed into \"paramilitary state\" a long time ago.",

You do understand what i described was a thought crime yes? They had no right to do what they did to me as i have committed no crime. Last time i checked getting their feelings hurt isnt a crime. Just thugs hiding behind their badge. Context literally doesnt matter because in no way are they legally able to put hands on you for telling them to fuck off. This was in my private residence too. I wouldve sued them for police brutality and kidnapping if i have the money.",

He was indoctrinated day in and day out that civilians are the enemy, that the \"blue wall\" was the most important thing ever (ie, cops enabling other bad cops) and all that horrible bullshit. At the end, because he didn't want to be that kind of cop, they failed him on the finish line for no real reason except that he was trying to be progressive, apparently. And after that, he didn't want to be a cop anymore. \n\nSo only right-wing violent little shit stains become cops, and are then trained to be hair-trigger violent even worse shit stains on the streets. And people wonder why cops literally shoot thousands of civilians every year... they do it because they've been trained to, and because their mindset is that they're at war against an enemy. Not that they're civil servants hired to keep the peace.",

At least once a week he was beaten up severely, the teachers did absolutely nothing about it. I will never forget that poor kid, hope he left that country as soon as he was able to.",

I kept it polite and said I am not a big fan of cops and had past incidents with corrupt police officers. She said that\u2019s why her son wanted to be a policeman, to change it from the inside. I told her I\u2019m happy to hear that and we went back to work.\n\nA few months later, she mentions her son is having to move to our state. She\u2019s visibly flustered and upset. Apparently, her son was giving water to a homeless man and his partner instead tried to arrest the homeless guy for\u2026 something. I think it was loitering? It was a rough, hands on arrest. The son tried to raise a complaint and was basically fired before the week ended. \n\nIt\u2019s been a couple of years and I haven\u2019t kept in contact, but she complained the entire time that her son can magically no longer find work as an officer anywhere he went.\n\nSo yeah, it\u2019s just anecdotal from what I experienced but many others share similar stories. Police protect their own and anyone who goes against the grain find themselves in trouble.",

Cops also shot at several other people without warning based on very vague statements that they were driving similar vehicles, despite the fact that they were different colors and one wasn't even a pickup. \n\nThe only slightly misleading part is the OP leaving out the number of innocent people targeted by the police, and maybe the fact that the fire in the cabin was incidental. If anyone needs proof that the cops in the US are totally unhinged, the \"war\" between them and Dorner is it. They went ham on random individuals with almost no justification, and every one of them was excused. Multiple injured civilians, thousands of rounds and millions of dollars, all because one individual threatened them.",

There was a lot to it beforehand that led to it, though it doesn't make it OK to kill others. \n\nHe was LAPD, and turned in his partner for kicking a schizophrenia and dementia patient. The partner was put on desk duty, there was an investigation, etc. The victim told his father about being kicked and also told Dorner's lawyer about being kicked, but didn't say anything about it during the hearing. They ruled that this meant Dorner was lying about his partner and fired him. \n\nAfter losing an appeal in 2011 for his 2008 termination, he wrote a manifesto on Facebook about what his plans were. He didn't apologize but he did say it was unfortunate that he must do it and didn't look forward to it to make \"substantial change\" in the LAPD. He cited Rodney King and the Rampart scandal, and wanting to reclaim his own name.\n\nIn his manifesto he had a list of 40+ targets to kill. He ended up killing 4, though the last was during the final standoff. He died by self inflicted gunshot wound. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Dorner_shootings_and_manhunt",

Nothing about arresting police officers who are blatantly breaking laws and violently abusing people should deter good cops from doing their job. \n\nLaw enforcement should require a 4 year degree, they should get paid better, they should be generally treated with more kindness and respect from the public, and being dishonorably discharged for criminal behavior should be considered in our society to be the most shameful and unforgivable of actions. I am not against law enforcement, I have huge respect and always treat police with kindness, patience, and integrity. That being said many police precincts in this country are extremely corrupt and are stuffed full of violent, ignorant, assholes who get off on forcing their will on others by just about any means necessary. The ones in those precincts that aren't, are complicit. Good cops go in to these corrupt precincts and either quit, stand aside, or become bad. This is a HUGE and incredibly serious issue that will only continue to improve by continuing to put pressure on the community of law enforcement and law makers to punish those who use their positions of authority to harm people.",

That means that someone higher up like the Sarge or the commissioner is corrupt. Even if the cop in the video placed the guy under arrest, the same outcome would have happened. He doesn't choose the fate. But maybe he's the one who reported it! Someone had to, right?",

All I'm trying to say is just because the one cop who kind of stopped him at the end didn't arrest him, doesn't mean he's a bad cop. Maybe he reported the crime later at the precinct. If cops are resting cops was normalized, maybe he would have, and I truly wish that was the way things were. But when you could be putting yourself in danger, reporting him at the station isn't the worst thing... He knows he's going to end up back there anyways",

I don't even remember anymore)  basically saying that they should all not be cops, including the cop who potentially reported him.\n\nMy point was that if we remove even the \"decent\" cops just for having self preservation and not making on-the-spot arrests, then the cop who punched the dude may not have faced any consequences at all, not even a suspension because there may have been nobody to report him.\n\nOverall, obviously it would be awesome if all of these cops could be removed and replaced with angels, but that's not going to happen. So let's not shame the cops with self preservation who report their cops to the Sarge, and let's try and have more of those people and eventually maybe a bad cop would be surrounded by all good cops and maybe he will be arrested one day.

Yes he patted the assaulting cop on the back, but he also got that cop away from the stretcher and stood between the cop and the stretcher. Communities that have their police in de-escalate training have more cops like the one in the mask and less like the one punching a kid on a stretcher.  Cops also need to be reminded that trust and respect are earned every time they work with the public. We the public need to be reminded that these cops are people who are responding to situations that could cost them or their coworkers their lives. They are going to have adrenaline running through their veins. Does this excuse excessive behavior or assault? Absolutely not. I would like more training for officers and I would like to see them held accountable for abuse. Bad cops shouldn\u2019t be able to get a job in another community if they are fired for abuse. We need a police force of some sort. I\u2019m 100% in favor of police reform and accountability, but All Cops Are Bastards, and Defund The Police, are no solutions.",

Protestors must step in to stop rioters or be associated with them in the zeitgeist. \n\nThere are lots of forces at play. There is huge bureaucratic momentum to overcome. But why play on one single field, if there are lots of forces at play? Where are the law suits, where are the protests, why do we accept the confederate flag flying over GA?  \n\nThe GA state flag is indicative of the point.

The only thing that varies from state to state for that charge is the amount of time served.\n\nBut instead of going in front a jury, this cop got to skip right past that.  Again, as I stated in my previous post, it just got treated like a mere workplace accident.\n\nAnd I am absolutely positive that if I watched the clip again, a few more times, I could come up with other charges.\n\nTo be honest, there is no easy fix for this.  It is not just the police, it is the prosecutors and judges as well.  And the juries too.  Yes, our population is partly to blame as well.  We all share responsibility in this.  In order to fix it we are going to have to scrap the entire thing, all of it, and then look within ourselves to come up with a better solution.  Time and money, neither of which very many people are willing to give up.  And it will take excessive amounts of both time and money.\n\nWe would have to fire every single police officer in the entire country.  The people who are doing the trainer are damaged goods.  The cops they have trained are subsequently also damaged goods.  Look at Derek Chauvin.  He was a training officer.  Every officer he trained needs to be fired.  They are all damaged goods.  And that is just one single example, maybe not even the worst of the examples, actually.\n\nAnd that is going to be scary for a whole lot of cowards.  See, most of our people are cowards.  They actually believe cops are protecting.  In order to stay sane they have to believe cops are protecting them, because they are too scared to protect themselves, so if the cops aren't doing the protecting, who is?  After the training officers are fired and the tainted officers they trained are fired, there won't be any police left.  Zero police.\n\nAnd that is just the first step, and not even the big step.\n\nAnyway, sadly I have to stop there, I don't have any more time, and this post, should I continue, would be excessively long.  Sucks to stop when it is incomplete, but such is life.",

People talk mad shit, spit, throw shit, scream, insult your mother, threaten violence and generally act stupid and unreasonable. Shit, people do that when shopping and nothing major is on the line.\n\nNow, whatever reason the guy is being arrested for is immaterial, whether he murdered a child or jaywalked, he has already been restrained and was being taken away. At that point the violence is done, he was taken down and strapped to a table. Now, anything he SAYS is completely harmless because it's nothing but air vibrating past his vocal chords, can't actually DO anything but spit and if you think paramedics have never been spit at and somehow avoided punching their patients I think you are fooling yourself, happens very regularly.\n\nThe point here is that we just watched a man with a gun and a whole lot of power punch a restrained man. The man throwing the punch just showed he has a weak will and a brittle spirit. You know how I can know this being any doubt? He was the only person to throw a punch and was pulled back by the other people there. That shows you the restrained guy didn't earn the punch, only one guy had problem enough to launch himself and he wasn't even the guy being actively shit talked out spit on. He has a weak nature and shouldn't be a cop. He should be held to a higher standard than the paramedics next to him, not a lower one.",

Your above comment is why you are getting downvoted. Whether it's your intention or not, comments like what youre saying are implying that you think there is some context in which this officer is not in the wrong. \n\nI dont know the full surrounding context, but I cant see how it is relevant. You might as well be asking \"well is the cop a republican though? Or a democrat?\" \n\nMaybe you're more.imaginative than I am - can you think of any relevant surrounding context that would make a cop lunging at and punching a person restrained on a stretcher okay?",

Or whatever that crazy shit was.\n\nAgain\u2026never called them unless our neighbors did when they saw people breaking into our house no matter what color they were. \n\nWhat the fuck? When I got home from school I hung out across the street with my friend Devin across the street and his parents, cause my mom was in nursing school and we all looked after each other because our parents worked at different times. \n\nYeah Devin was black if that means anything to you, but he was just my friend who I played video games with and we rode bikes and did what kids do.\n\nI still talk to him sometimes, he\u2019s doing great.\n\nI don\u2019t trust the police, so I don\u2019t deal with them.

Some barbers require more training than police officers but this varies by state, county and department. Where I come from, minimum requirements to even be interviewed for the police department are: Associates degree and/or 4 years of military service with honorable discharge. Once hired applicants go through 28 week academy and then do 1 year of work with direct supervision (you have a FTO with you at all times) then 1 year of supervision with an FTO responding to the same calls as you, as well as checking in on your work etc. Cross state lines though, they\u2019ve got a 6 week academy and you get a gun and a badge with now supervision immediately. \n\nAlso your last fact uses a story from almost 30 years ago.",

There was supposed to be no contact i.e. no body checking or other rough play as some of the NHL players were getting fairly old, but some of the police teams players would always end up getting too physical and throw a few checks in.",

When an employee damages a car, the funds to repair the car come out of a shared bonus pool that gets split between all the managers at the end of the year. So basically if an employee fucks up a car and it costs $5k to fix, thats $5k less in the bonus pool. \n\nWhile it wasn\u2019t really managers driving the cars too much, I remember one damaging a couple cars while I was there. It definitely worked to keep them on employees and other managers to be driving safely, paying attention in the parking lots, etc.",

People who have pensions generally do not have separate nest eggs, because the pension IS their retirement - it\u2019s often collected from government jobs where employees are accepting lower compensation upfront due to the promise of more on the backend. It is a promise of compensation to be paid. It is your money that you earned. \n\nImagine if you were a retiree from Walmart, and when Walmart paid a legal settlement they pulled into your personal 401k to pay it. The 401k you had accrued and earned over your career, which you are depending on for retirement. You no longer work for them. You no longer are involved with them. But they reached into your bank account to pay off their settlement. Would that sound reasonable to you?\n\nAdvocating for institutions to pull funding for their legal settlements from their retirees\u2019 pension funds is easily the most fucked up thing I regularly see cheered on Reddit. Jesus fucking Christ y\u2019all. That\u2019s some batshit sadistic, dystopian shit.",

No moving to a new dept, etc.\n\nIt\u2019s not as plainly fair or probably as boldly effective as taking payouts from pensions, but I think it has a better chance of being the solution due to similar systems already being in place.\n\nBtw, re: your diet, I heard Taco Bell now has $10 monthly subscriptions for a taco per day(?)\"\n\n\nYou literally talk about carrying the malpractice insurance. Simple question, how does this license change anything? They'll still investigate themselves and protect themselves. All you're doing is adding a 3rd party that is profit seeking. It also transfers responsibility from the state, to a private party making it significantly less likely people will ever collect on the larger payouts.\n\n Also I know this may blow your mind but it's still going to be the taxpayers paying for this.  We will have to pay cops more to cover the cost of their licensing and malpractice insurance.  Which will then be handed to a 3rd party by those police officers.  The insurance companies will have to charge enough to not only make a profit but also pay for the malpractice which means we will end up paying more.\n\n I mean unless you know of some magical insurance company that survives without making money.",

Every time a cop violates the rights of people their Union always defends the officers actions vigorously, that's just how it goes right or wrong, and when they end up in court and are found guilty the city ends up paying for the police misconduct or whatever the situation dictates.\nMy point is cities and taxpayers shouldn't have to accept complete responsibility. Hopefully you live where there's nothing to get upset about. The Police department where I live have terrible interactions with the homeless folks. They make certain to lot get their fingerprints where they don't want them. Park Patrol, Hitler youth, have the privilege of handling people who are most vulnerable, the hunt us down looking for a person smoking or drinking in a park.

The whole ordeal lead to the individual losing their job because they missed their shift. Without qualified immunity that individual would be allowed to sue the officer for a perfectly legal and justified traffic stop. It doesn't mean they would win in court, but would be allowed to sue.\n\nNow let's say an officer pulled over someone for now reason, said they smelled pot, searched the person's car, found no pot and found no signs of intoxication. Then they called a few more cops in to harass the person for another hour and arrested them for some BS charges, which were later dropped for lack of merit. Obviously the cop was not acting under good faith of the law. If qualified immunity was applied correctly, the individually should be allowed to sue the officer.\n\nNow I have no idea how to fix the system, but qualified immunity has a purpose, but law enforcement officers their precinct, their unions, DAs, regulators, etc seem to want to protect all the bad officers. If officers were held accountable, their training appropriate to their role(no warrior training), I think most of the current LEOs would be outstanding officers.

Kinda like doctors or medical specialists, they have malpractice insurance and are can be contracted and not directly employed. But, if they fuck up you can still sue hospital itself as well as the doctor. The hospital allowed the doctor to do what they do, so therefor they accepted the liability of his actions in doing so. \n\nSame thing with cops will happen, yeah they could be independent contractors, but city or county would still be sued because they hired the guy in the first place.",

When dealing with a cop, American citizens usually understand that they could be one officer's bad day away from staring down a gun barrel, and that officer can do whatever they want to you without consequences. It's fucked.

Also, the use of force must be ended when the assailant stops the assault. Punching someone in the face is not in line with spitting on someone, and if he stopped spitting they need to stop using violence. Also, the assault would have ended if the cop just took a step back so the man on the stretcher couldn't spit on them anymore. \n\nAlso, by the way the cop charges at the man and stands so close you can see the cop is acting out of emotion instead of reason. That's no way for a cop to act. Sure, they can have emotions but those emotions shouldn't affect the way they work. \nFor example I'm a nursing student. During internships I've been spat on, hit, shouted at, ... but no decent nurse would start punching someone for that. We might restrain them if absolutely necessary, but that's it. If we can act non-violently on people trying to hurt us in worse ways than spitting on us, why can't cops in way less violent situations?",

They are armed and without oversight, they should be unflappable. Talking shit to a cop should end with the cup laughing at you for trying to get under his skin not with him punching a restrained guy. I could avoid punching that guy and I don't have any training or special skills in dealing with tough situations. I mean they don't either but we all seem to pretend they do for some reason even though they have shit solve rates, have no legal or moral obligation to protect or serve (they took that to the supreme court to make sure they don't), have a miss rate on firearms that is comparable to civilian shootings, kill dogs at an sounding rate, kill each other at a pretty high rate (seriously look it up), AND have almost no oversight? We somehow give them an excuse to be shittier to the rest of us even though they don't have nearly the most dangerous job in this country. PLENTY of people work much more dangerous jobs and deal with people just as shitty and manage to NOT punch a dude strapped on a stretcher because of his words.

I have not cursed anyone.  I have laid hands on exactly one client who was poking me in the chest with her finger.  I put my hand on her chest and pushed her away from me.  Gently pushed her away from me.  Then I asked her to not make me call the police.  I involve the police as little as possible because their mere presence escalates many people.  I think this is because frequently the officer or deputy starts out escalated.  We have an officer who does nothing but child abuse and rape cases.  He doesn't escalate.  He is also in his early 60s.  Long term experience seems to weed out some of the most aggressive cops.  The problem is he works a more or less 9 to 5, 40 hours per week, so we have to request whatever officer or deputy is available during on call hours, which are 4:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. week days and 4:00 p.m. Friday to 8:00 a.m. Monday.  Now to show my age even more than admitting to a 19 year career; I think police should be 25 years old at a minimum and the education should include conflict resolution, psychology, sociology, critical race theory, basic classes on mental illnesses, and I could go on.  Law enforcement should be a specialized bachelor's degree and being hired should be contingent on a recent full scale psychological exam.  Of course, the start pay, and the entire pay scale, would have to increase to reflect the requirements, but you pay for what you get, and cops where I live start out at an average of $11.10 per hour.  Fast food starts out at $12.50 an hour first shift and $14.50 third shift.  Just saying.",

It counts as self defence, because of the \"fighting words\"\n    \nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighting_words \n   \nIt's usually something like you think you are in immediate danger and they're ***PROBABLY*** gonna attack you sooner rather than later. Or it's something like severe racial or homophobic or transphobic slurs, hate speech, anything like that\n   \nPeople have this odd idea that you're allowed to say whatever you want to people and as long as you don't touch them first, then you're in the clear, and they'll definitely be charged with assault. It doesn't work like that. You're allowed to defend yourself from assault via words, with your fists, or whatever. It's not a guarantee it'll work as a defense in court, but it can, and does. Free speech isn't 100% free, even in the US. There have always been limitations to it, even in the constitution itself. \n   \nAssault comes in many forms. Things like throwing drinks on people or spitting at them, that's assault.\n  \nBut either way, cops should never do that. They're meant to he held to a higher standard than the civilian population. I'm not trying to justify this brutal cop. He has absolutely no excuse. Whatever the guy was saying. The cop was in absolutely no danger whatsoever\n  \nBut yeah for normal civilians, fighting words is a real thing, it's not just a meme from western movies where people say \"thems fighting words\". It's an actual legal doctrine.",

When it came out in the news, there were so many Facebook detectives informing his family, friends, and neighbors (even the neighbors who were witnesses) what kind of person he was, what happened that night, that it was self defense and that he deserved it. All because at first the police said it *may* be self defense within the first 24 hours of the shooting.\n\nIt's now being investigated as a homicide. The guy who shot him had been harassing him and the police weren't taking him seriously, but my sister sent texts from the victim about the perpetrator to the investigators. He was after him.\n\nPeople *want* these people to deserve it. They really wanted my sister's best friend to deserve to die. They verbally attacked his family and friends for saying otherwise and tried to *educate* us about how it was okay and entirely his fault. \n\nMaybe it's just an American thing. I don't know. But there's definitely a large chunk of Americans who get joy out of our warped relationship around firearms and the police. They'll cheer on a dead body sprawled out on the ground with blood pooling if there's some law that can justify it.",

He punches the restrained stretcher man and says, \"Don't do that shit again...to any officer!\". Hmm, why not \"another officer or EMT\" or \"any of us\" at the very least? Because this thinner-than-paper skinned cop isn't upset about what is happening, he's still upset about what happened before the man was put on the stretcher.\n\nSecond, the cop just made the situation even worse and delayed the EMTs more than the stretcher man ever would have. Even the EMT is annoyed and you can see him physically move the cop's arm off the other man. Just watch his face. He remains calm throughout it all and asks for a spit mask, unlike the cop. Now they have to check the man's level of consciousness, see if he has a broken jaw and/or nose, see if his breathing is obstructed, see if he has a concussion, etc. So yeah, who made things worse again? Officer Tinyballs.\n\nGo to any ER in the US and ask how often they get spit on. Now ask them if they've ever hit a restrained person or if they think hitting restrained person is the proper response. I assure you that almost every single one of them will respond with a resounding \"No.\" because, even though they get mistreated constantly, they are almost always cool-headed individuals there to actually help people. They don't have any of the gear that police do, yet they deal with all the irate and unhinged people the cops leave them. Maybe our police need to go through the same patient training as ER nurses.\n\nAre you saying the cop is worried about spit? He's not wearing a mask, so it seems as though he's not that worried. No, he saw an opportunity to let out his rage. Even his buddy who was spit on didn't overreact. Spit isn't actually all that dangerous in small amounts. Sure, you can get a virus like the flu or covid, but if you're properly vaccinated then that risk is minimal at best. It's even lower if you're...wearing a mask. So yeah, the excuse of punching a restrained man for spitting because spit is icky is complete bullshit. Keep reaching. I'll keep knocking you down. You're beat.\n\nOh, and if you think that I've been talking hard then you're a real softie. I just don't like the taste of leather like you do. Enjoy your boot soup, loser.",

You really thought that \u201cwhat if it is a 16 year old\u201d was a gotcha statement. If I am being attacked by any minor under my care, I can place them in a non-lethal restraint. If I do not perform the restraint correctly, again, I am held accountable. I can be under investigation by the state for abuse and lose my license. If a 16 year old feels the need to attack me, a adult in a position of power does not have the right to cause him physical harm. I know the role and responsibility that I have for my clients and I would never wish to harm them no matter if they are trying to harm me. This police officer is a coward. He attacked a man that was being restrained because he called him a bad word. He literally had to walk several feet to assault him at that. He shows a lack of impulse control and is not an individual that deserves a gun patrolling the street.\n\nEdit:\nAfter rereading your comment I see that I misread the intent of your words, so I apologize.

Not unless you're very well-trained as well as at least on par with the person in strength. And even then it's nearly impossible unless you get him to the ground first. You're expected to stand there and let a person punch your teeth in just because that person is a minor?\n\nAlso the reason I specified age is because e.g. a five-year-old swinging at you is absolutely not a serious threat and no, you should not strike him. Only older teens could theoretically do actual harm to an adult.\n\nAnd I don't know why you're comparing this to the officer here because it literally is not the same thing. Officers totally have the right to strike a person who is striking them, just like I am totally within my right to punch a guy who is actively attempting to harm me. The reason this officer should be fired and charged with a crime is because he struck a person who not only was not trying to hurt him but was not even ABLE to hurt him.",

And more to the point--we are suppose to AVOID it at all costs and are held accountable for every instance that we can't. Someone swearing, spitting, or even taking a one off swing at you is not usually enough to justify a restraint of that person--for good reason, it's dangerous and it often just amps the person up instead of deescalateing them.",

And it is extremely difficult to get someone to the ground in a way that doesn't involve either making them fall backwards or slamming them, which is also likely to cause harm unless it's done in a controlled environment like a mat in a dojo.\n\nAnd before you accuse me of moving goalposts, this whole comment chain started with the premise that the person was actively attacking.",

TB, hepatitis, viral meningitis, and cytomegalovirus can be transferred by spit as well, but it generally would take a decent amount of spit to infect you. Again, if they were that worried then they would have had masks on. Cops and EMTs most likely get spit at almost daily. Shouldn't they have protection against that by now? Like, say...masks?",

And in this day and age with the pandemic abound \" covid and all of that\" the very possibility of spitting something towards other is disgusting and poses a risk to the health of the officer and the paramedics loading him up. \n\nthe police assaulting a man restrained to the stretcher? That's just low. I agree with ya, just wipe it off, add the new charges and be done with it. It's bad enough the reputation of the police is fully in question in addition to every single active calls for its disbandment. Rushing in to beat a man who is in the hands of the medical personnel?

It's a way to de-stress in the face of a broken system and get reddit points. It also lazily dehumanizes and generalizes all cops instead of dealing with the real issues  that lead to stuff like this in the first place. We pay a laughable amount, provide them a laughable amount of psychological support, vote in the same politicians who keep the system broken on purpose and then put on our surprised pikachu face when we find out we're getting what we pay and vote for. \n\nNO one wants to take any responsibility for it. But we also have a culture of entitlement that promotes people infantilizing themselves. Leadership is also about the scarcest resource we have in america...scratch that...in the world. So it's no surprise when you see the general trends in online discussion. It all plays out how children behave. All finger pointing, exaggeration, hypocrisy and very little accountability or reason.",

There's no profession where you can strip someone's pension money bc a completely different person didn't do their job right so that'll never happen.\n\nBut bonuses tied to dept performance and accountability? Independent, elected, citizen review boards to hold them accountable similar to school boards? Forget jury duty, sign me up for this.\n\nNot only do the cops have a reason to hold each other accountable (None of them want to lose 1-10k per PERSON bc some morons tuned up a cuffed perp), but like I said, this increases pay significantly so we can attract better people to the job.",

Which if you've ever been a part of anything organized is how people operate.  And if you actually know any cops they'd tell you this is how they tend to handle the dumbest asses. They don't tend to throw hands at fellow officers in the middle of arrests\n\nYou could also try just looking...\n\nhttps://youtu.be/yOegqWf4pM4\n\nAnd it goes beyond this video. In the comments someone points out he's been removed from other depts bc other officers wouldn't tolerate his shit. Like I said, a lot of accountability tales place off cam. \n\nObviously, like I said, we also have way too many instances where cops don't hold their partners accountable at all. Too many instances of the system also  not holding them accountable. \n\nSo now that you're factually wrong on every account I'm sure you'll admit you exaggerated about something you don't know. Nvm this is reddit, you'll triple down...",

EMS gets threatened by patients all the time and don\u2019t have a gun, mace, or baton to protect themselves. Getting spit on is so common. Getting cursed out is so common. \n\nGet over yourself and think about this patient being a living breathing person and and recognizing that you don\u2019t know about the person\u2019s mental state or history. Then, place yourself in a situation where you are in need of EMS and are terrified for your life and your brain is screaming at you and boom. \n\nThink of it like a dog that is scared and cornered. Imagine it bites you out of fear and is in fight or flight mode. You don\u2019t know this dog well, don\u2019t know what it\u2019s been through, and you don\u2019t expect it to lash out?

They don\u2019t react because of the blue wall of silence. Each officer has to commit some crimes so nobody snitches on each other for committing crimes. If you snitch they will retaliate in some way. So regardless of whether you fix one officers behavior, the system still cannot have \u201cgood apples\u201d because they are retaliated against. They get away with crime most of the time because of qualified immunity, blue wall of silence and internal affairs. \n\nThere are some circumstances where this isn\u2019t the case but it is a systemic issue that cannot be stopped with behavioral training or anger management.",

I took too broad of an angle. But the majority are scum and it starts with who they target to be police officers, and from there, any dumb cop they hire is bound to end up a piece of shit. \n\nYour momma ever tell you that you are who you surround yourself with?

But we also have a wave of public outcry that could lead to change if it wasn't being co-opted and misdirected all the time with lazy dehumanizing generalizations for internet points.\n\nIt is very good that people are outraged and demanding change bc we need it so badly. It's just so badly misdirected. It's not that so much energy is directed towards \"All are bad!\" It's that ALL the energy is directed that way and none of it is directed appropriately at \"Here's what we need to fix this.\"\n\nI honestly feel people generalizing, \"All cops bad\" are just lazy, appealing for internet points and legitimately hurt our ability to fix this bc it just creates a blindly hostile us vs them situation where there's no way to reach needed compromises/fixes.\n\nIf reddit had its way, a good cop in NY would have his pension and pay docked bc these guys, wherever they are, didn't do right. (I read an upvoted comment promoting docking the national pension). It's nonsense but I get it's rooted in legitimate, justified frustration and outrage.\n\nThe people we vote in also have a vested interest in making sure the system stays broke to feed a billion dollar prison system.

If a stranger, a citizen, punched this dude, I think we should be applauding and saying, \u201cdude deserved it, oh well\u201d. However, an officer can NOT act that way. They are held to a different standard by law. If we as citizens are asked to respect their authority and act civilized to them when they pull us over, when they direct traffic, when they ask for our ID, etc, we should respect that request and obey. And they should obey the laws and oaths that govern them, and they should not be allowed to abuse a non threat strapped to a stretcher.\n\n\nEdit: the fuck am I getting downvoted for.

There are probably other ways to accomplish this by pinning his head down or smothering him, but I think knocking him out or at least showing him that spitting will be met with some intense force is perfectly justified. This guy is a police officer, so he should be showing the utmost of restraint, but personally if someone spit at me I would try to get them unconscious immediately, I\u2019d probably go a little overboard tbh.",

That makes them bastards also. \n\nWe give police an unbelievable amount of power and control. Therefore they must be held to a greater responsibility. Which means that good cops, if there are any, must be treated as bastards unless they are actively fighting against the bad cops.\n\nWhich they aren't. Case in point, this video. If I, a non-cop, had walked up to that guy in that situation and assaulted him in that way I would have been face down on the ground being cuffed 2 seconds later.\n\nWhy wasn't that cop arrested immediately, hmm?",

Fuck him, I don\u2019t care who that speck of shit is, I\u2019m glad he got what he deserved.

Get him off the streets, punch him, lock him up, the filth he is.\n\nI\u2019d rather risk cops accidentally harming someone who didn\u2019t deserve it on rare occasions than to let thousands of these fuckers get special treatment. I bet you\u2019re going to come back and say but it\u2019s not rare! You\u2019d like to think that because you consume this bullshit on a consistent basis, but you never consume the hundreds of thousands of GOOD THINGS cops do. You only watch the bad, and it becomes your reality. Cops do good shit all the time, constantly, and you never care about that. You only want to hear about the bad because you have an authority complex and are addicted to watching people with authority do wrong, and you take everything good they do for granted.

I come downstairs to discovers someone rummaging around, going through cabinets and stealing shit.  I ask them what their doing, and they turn around and point a gun at me.  At this point, I am unarmed and standing there like an idiot.  There are a few things I could do in this situation.\n\nI could pull out my phone and try and call the police.  The robber tells me to put my phone down, and when I don't, he shoots me.  I'm now dead, and the only use the police will be is cleaning up my body.\n\nI could rush him, and try and take his gun.  This would most likely also end with me dead or injured.\n\nI could put my hands up, tell him that he can take what he wants as long as he leaves me and my family unharmed.  If I'm lucky, the robber will take what he wants and leave, and whilst I will have lost money, at least I'm not dead.  I don't really see any other way for me to get out of this situation with my life.\n\nSo, in short, yes I would sit there and do nothing, because I value my life and my family's life over my possessions.",

Anything remotely supporting the police is seen as a horrible thing because you have a certain narrative. Yes I do believe we have a fundamentally flawed police force and better training and allocation of real curves is needed, but he makes a fair point. When people Unironically  say fuck the police, it\u2019s a kacneyed response to a corrupt cop, and this statement undermines and invalidates the struggles risks that cops have undoubtedly undergone. From fires, to armed robberies, to suicide prevention, deescalation,  and all these other facets of the job, cops still risk their lives everyday. You could say.fuck the system as a whole because it is undoubtedly corrupt, but the individuals should not be seen as a monolith. I\u2019ve had many run ins with cops that have been good and bad experiences, and i am Indian btw.",

That is the status quo in most places. \n\nWhat do you think about funding that helps address the root causes of crime? Things that help with homelessness or addiction or mental health. \n\nOr should we focus all funding on reacting to the crime after the fact. Is that more effective in your opinion?\n\nPolice in most cases don't prevent crime, they react to crime. They do help keep society safe, but it might be worth considering what leads to the crime in the first place, and putting some of the funding toward that.\n\nDenver is one example of success:\n\n>According to\u00a0a Washington Post database\u00a0of fatal shootings by on-duty police officers, since 2015, police have fatally shot nearly 1,400 people with mental illnesses\n\n>Over the first six months of the pilot, Denver\u00a0received more than 2,500 emergency calls that fell into the STAR program's purview, and the STAR team was able to\u00a0respond\u00a0to 748 calls.\u00a0No calls required the assistance of police, and no one was arrested.\n\nhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/02/06/denver-sent-mental-health-help-not-police-hundreds-calls/4421364001/\n\nDoes Denver have it all wrong with this? It sounds like a win win, police have less calls to respond to and can focus on actual crime, less mentally ill people are treated with aggression and arrested or worse. Please enlighten us with your thoughts on how this is a bad idea\n\nEdit: this is always where the conversation ends. It gives me the impression a lot of right wing folks only have a surface level understanding of the topics they hold such strong opinions toward, likely no more than what their right wing propaganda networks told them to think. It's discouraging, we could be making a better society but half the population is brainwashed by people who oppose any form of progress and don't have any of our best interests in mind.",

Thats how you make drug addicts.\n\nThis cop should be suspended with mandatory psychological help and then a professional can determine if he is fit for work and not the court of social media.",

The people employing and mamaging this group of police officers should be fired, its his fault this situation happened.\n\nTo clarify, I don't think what happened here is correct, but I do think that there is a culture in this department that people aren't treated like people, that is something that needs to be addressed by someone in power, they need to bring it up in reviews and weekly meeting and take disciplinary action on every single officer here that isn't mass suspension but will actually fix the issue.\n\nThe issue social media has is they see officer X gets suspended or fired and then next week officer Y does the samr thing and they call for that person's removal. If it's a single employee its their fault, when its the whole department its a management issue.",

If there is really a large percentage of the police force being overly violent how is it that the individual officers are seen as the problem and not the management structure they are placed in.\n\nThe situation should 100% be addressed, what happened in this video would be treated by a judge as frivolous if it wasn't a police officers in my opinion, the response was wrong from the officer but it can be addressed out of court.\n\n100% if someone is seriously injured by a rogue police officer they should be dealt with within the confides of the law and the judge may very well pass down a suspended sentence and physh treatment and they would be removed from the police force.\n\nI highly doubt that a police officer goes from being a young person out of college to being a murdering psychopath instantly. There were many warning signs along the way. What the officer in this video demonstrated is a warnin sign that needs to very urgently be addressed but you cannot discount managements role in that.\n\nImagine for a second every retail worker in a department store treats every customer like crap. If it's one worker then it's likely an individual that's at fault, if its the whole department the fault lies firmly on management. You can be a lot more lax in that case with discipline on the workers because lives aren't at risk. In the police force it has to be suspension and a forced psych workup at the very least or if the law allows for it that they be judged by the law.\n\nBut by no means should someone who is very obviously showing signs of needing help have the rest if their life ruined because of a situation they were placed in. If they didn't see themselves spiral after this situation and they continued down this road then there is definitely personal accountability, I don't think they shouldn't be held accountable. I just think for fringe cases like this media is persecuting the officer and not those responsible for his actions.",

Like 4-8 weeks of training and a GED or high school diploma.\n\nAnd management are composed of the same people.\n\nYour comparison breaks down due to the fact that I can chose to have nothing to do with a department store and They will go out of business.\n\nYou can't chose to have nothing to do with the police.  All you can do is raise public awareness to the fact that police are abusing the citizens till the public as a whole moves to reform the system.\n\nI.E. the social media posts are trying to show that individual officers are not being held accountable due to a corrupt system that needs to be replaced.  The entire institution of policing is broken in the US.\n\nFYI these are not fringe cases.",

They want revenge on an individual.\n\nGuaranteed there was a press conference called by the very person that should be held responsible and fired that says officer X has been suspended pending an investigation. This should instead be a press conference held by the mayor's office saying they are reviewing the actions of the police department and further action will be taken. \n\nPeople are asking for the wrong version of accountability. Its obvious from the news that these individuals are being disciplined, people quickly lose interest in these smaller cases. There was no inquiry made by the media and published saying that officer X was determined unfit for the job after his suspension and has been moved to a different role in the police force because that doesn't sell, even though its good media.\n\nThe department store is an analogy that describes the behaviour of the management not of the general public's response, its not a comparison its a tool in understanding a different point of view to the one you currently hold.\n\nHow many of these ofricers have a history showing a steady increase in the severity of their violent actions eventually leading up to serious injury or death? From the article's I've seen there are many. Media very rarely makes that a point and that that is a systemic problem. Media rather uses it as a tool to say \"you see he's a violent individual and he should be locked up for good\" and not \"Why was this individual allowed to get to this point, someone in power should be held responsible\"",

But yeah, if the lawsuit could actually ruin a cops life, then maybe they would think twice before using unnecessary force. I mean in this case, the guy is already done for, if the cop would have been the bigger man, any insults thrown his way should have just been shrugged off as another day, another dollar. But no, he had to assert some dominance by being petty in his act. As if it would make the poor guy in the stretcher respect him any more. /smh",

Spitting is considered  a battery that warrants force to divert or stop the source from producing more. Use of force policy dictates you can meet or go one level about the force being used against you. Diffused strikes are a legal and legitimate option against somebody spitting on you regardless of Restraints. \n\nThe level of ignorance I am being met with by stating FACTS is appalling. The cognitive dissonance it takes to come at me personally in a hostile way for use of force policy used by police across the country is abhorrent. \n\nThe reddit echo chamber can't censor, downvote and silence its way to achieving mob rule in the public sphere. Striking and individual committing a battery by way of oral bodily fluid is legally permissible. This isn't conjecture, it's fact. \n\nDowmvoting and arguing this fact doesn't make you correct, it reveals your ignorance on subject matter, use of force and police policy. Stop spreading emotional logical fallacies on reddit, it looks bad on all of you.",

Especially if they're restrained and being put into an ambulance. \n\nHe's a police officer. It's literally part of his job to be the bigger person and show some sliver of decorum. And if I, a disabled, autistic, agoraphobic 4'11\" young adult who is (apparently \ud83d\ude44) so thoroughly traumatized that I cannot adequately function as a gainful member of society due to that, can reign myself in WITH NO TRAINING, then so can he. \n\nI am saying this as someone who could not further reign myself in, just last night. This was an eruption of hurt emotions after being the bigger person (while being walked on/spat on) nonstop for the past two years. That man is trained to keep himself together. Being spit on or insulted needs to be something he can brush off and deal with in a healthy way. Not something that results in him punching someone who is restrained and being put into an ambulance.\n\nIs insulting someone and spitting on them an asshole thing to do? Absolutely! Without a shadow of a doubt! Does that make the way the police officer handled it okay? NO. NO IT DOES NOT.",

A stranger who simply provided a comment in an area where he has some level of expertise, as it is what he does for a living, and has done for quite some time. \n\nYou also prove my point. The fact that police officers are human is exactly why we need constitutional safeguards in place to protect those accused of crimes. We entrust police officers with the power to use physical force and injure and even kill citizens who have not been convicted of a crime. Because they are human, sometimes police officers have bad intentions. Not all the time, but some of the time. That is why they undergo use of force and use of restraint training. \n\nControlling the ability of officers of the state to use force against, seize, search, arrest, and prosecute people within the United States was an important part of what the founders of this country considered as necessary for the protection of liberty and freedom. That is why a large part of our constitution is devoted to that, and why I am devoted to standing up for those parts of the constitution.",

And on average, 71 hours are spent on firearms training, verse 21 hours on de-escalation.\n\n\"Most of the training in the US is focused on various types of use of force, primarily the various types of physical force. The communication skills are largely ignored by most police academies.  This is why you see officers very rapidly escalating from initial communication to the actual physical use of force, because this is how they train.\"\n\nIt's also why so often after a violent incident, the excuse from the brass or the police union is something along the lines of, \"The officer followed department policy\".\n\nThey train like they're the military.  They have the warrior mindset driven into them, at the expense of the \"I'm a public servant/peace officer\" mindset.",

And they place more focus on things like sociology, psychology, and deescalation.\n\nWhat's your view on the \"warrior classes\" taught by people like Dave Grossman?\n\nGood? Bad? Responsible? Dangerous?\n\nWhat's your view on this [short article](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.usatoday.com/amp/5342917002) written by a career officer from a family of officers?\n\nThis is exactly the kind of thing much of the public wants.  It sounds entirely reasonable. It sounds obvious even and it's more closely aligned with what much of the world already does.  It's the kind of thing that can have very real benefits for both the officers and the public.\n\nI'm genuinely curious for your opinion.",

You were talking about how people are hypocrites for being okay with sucker punches when they don't come from cops and now you're saying that the criminal deserved it because they were a criminal. Is it somehow more okay that the punch came from a cop even though the dude is completely restrained and surrounded by more than enough people to prevent him from doing anything more than taunting? People still have rights even if they broke a law, that doesn't just give people free reign to do whatever they want to the person",

But if this criminal just ran through a school zone drunk driving killing a kid.  Or maybe he raped a kid and someone caught him, beating him up.  I give zero fucks about a sucker punch.  \n\nYou woketards are so easy to get all riled up, when trying to inject some common sense or context into an intentionally deceiving video.

If it hadn't been a cop and one dude spit on another dude y'all would be cheering that the dude that spit got whooped.\n\nThe cop got punished. His actions were on body cam and I'm sure that punk probably got his charges dropped or his court appointed attorney got them lowered.

Part of the job of a cop should be extreme emotional control.  I know cops are humans too but when you're given deadly weapons and the authority and leverage over civilians, you must be better than civilians in controlling emotions, anger, irritation, being baited to go punch someone, etc.",

Our police are often judge, jury, and executioner in the streets (shouldn't be, but they are) so we should really give incentives to potential officers, to attract a better quality person. Many officers are barely qualified to flip a burger, and that just puts more pressure on the few good cops. Then you have the crooked/dishonest cops, making them all look bad.

What I\u2019m trying to point out is while what the officer did was wholly wrong, have some empathy. We don\u2019t know how many times he\u2019s been worn down by a verbal barrage. Of course we should expect our officers to keep it together, but how they\u2019re currently treated I can understand where some might snap. That is not an excuse, it\u2019s being empathetic. My whole point is people on this website have reacted strongly to slight inconveniences and insults, and it\u2019s hypocritical to deride this officer who\u2019s probably been on the receiving end of much worse. Just because Someone in a \u201cposition of power\u201d does something wrong doesn\u2019t make them any less human.",

That same officer who was going to kill a handcuffed man then admitted to lying about basically everything, and only got four months and retained his retirement and pension.  Had the culture been one where cops who stop cops from doing bad things were backed up, the piece of shit cop wouldn't have gone on to terrorize multiple other people thereby shitting on the already trashed reputation trying to be held together by the very few cops who do try to change things. Until cops can point out bad, reckless and dangerous behavior of other police officers without retribution from the \"brotherhood\" then they will be collectively be considered to be bad. The amount of power police are given doesn't allow for these types of fuck ups to be swept under the rug.",

You just have to design a new system, hire the good cops that pass the evals and remove the old system. Things like qualified immunity need to go, if cameras magically turn off then the officer is arrested, we need a third party to audit etc. The solutions are there but they don\u2019t happen because the people in charge are rich and famous. They don\u2019t get punched by cops or care about normal people.",

The POS in question is indeed a POS. But just like your mom probably taught you, two wrongs do not make a right.\n\nA police officer is supposed to be better than the criminals. If you spit on me, and I hit you in the face as hard as this officer hit this RESTRAINED person, I would be the one going to jail. That was felony battery. \n\nThis officer has demonstrated that he is not fit to wear the uniform. \n\n>Let alone let him loose all into our backyards where we have innocent people daily just trying to enjoy their life but have to watch out for people like him! No thank you he got what he asked for.\n\nYou realize that regardless of his crimes, the guy had ALREADY BEEN CAUGHT. Would you like to live in a society where armed men can decide if you get to live or not based on their personal opinion of you? Because that is what you are advocating for.\n\nThe police do not exist to punish crime. (and any cop with a punisher logo needs to lose their job for incompetence.)\n\nThe cops themselves believe that they are an occupying force and that civilians are their enemies. (Look up 'killology' as a police training curriculum, and tell me that is what you believe it means to live in a free society.)\n\nI respect police officers. But in my opinion, the INSTANT a person commits a crime, they cease to be a police officer. And thus they lose my respect. If you can't do the job with out criming, perhaps law enforcement isn't for you.",

You are so creepily excited at the idea of doing violence to someone. Do you believe that being spit on is of equivalent violence to 'beating him non stop until someone pulled me away'? \n\nWould you then go quietly to prison? You know what you have described is felony attempted murder, right?\n\nIt is very clear that you aren't a cop. Nor do you seem to be very interested in actual rule of law. Because if you did, you'd know that you have no way of knowing if this person is a 'felon'. That's a word with an actual meaning, and you aren't using it correctly. (Hint, felons have been sentenced in courts. This is legally an innocent person. And remember, every law you claim doesn't apply to him also doesn't apply to you.)\n\n>It\u2019s just sad that everyone backs up people like this POS\n\nPoint of order: I back up people, period. It doesn't matter what the POS did or didn't do. That is not your job, nor the cop's job to determine. I'd back up anyone in that position, regardless of what they did. Because that's what it means to be a civilized person under the rule of law. \n\nWhere do police get their authority from?",

My company had a special set of claim guys and fellow lawyers who defended cops, both good and horrible who were sued under 42 USC Section 1983.  This federal law allows individuals a private right of action against the involved public entity and the bad actor the be sued for depriving others of their civil rights. Most of these lawsuits were vigorously and successfully defended. \n\nHowever, we learned many cops are nothing more than a high school bully with a badge and a gun spurred on by racism.  On these cases with stunning video evidence of abject depravity we did all we could to pay my company\u2019s money to get the cases closed and then leave it to the insured entity to deal with the scumbag. \n\nSadly, I saw many such cases.  I, too, thought the pervasive nature of videos would have a positive effect of deterrence, but some of this cretinous hate filled people are just so hate filled and self-entitled to see their criminal acts are in any way wrongful. Couple this with hiring practices that exclude candidates for being too smart and the systemic cruelty remains ever-present.",

They aren't always there to help us and that a lot of the time, cops are like the sherrif of knotingham. They are there to scare. She saw one video clip of a cop beating up on someone who really didn't deserve it and thats how the lesson started. She saw someone she looked to as a hero be a villan. She doesnt want to play cops and robbers anymore. We've let her have free reign of the water hose in the yard when its warm anough so she can play fire fighters instead.

Cops can use a reasonable amount of force to stop a crime being committed or to restrain someone. Spitting on someone is gross, is a crime, and in many cases is at least harassment, therefore the cops are allowed to use a reasonable amount of force to stop it. Idk but if you ask me, punching him once and telling him to stop is more than reasonable. \n\nNow I might be assuming this next part, but you might ask...\"bUt thE OtHeR CoPs pUlLeD HiM AwAy\". Well ya because they probably know someone is recording and know that ever uneducated person would say they did something wrong even though they didn't.  They probably don't want to deal with the backlash. \n\nRemember that video of that dude that busted that guy in the head with a twisted tea and everyone was praising the guy because the dude he hit kept saying the N word ? What that dude did was 100% illegal. The other dude didn't touch him, just shouted some racial slurs which isn't a crime in America. It could possibly be disorderly conduct but you can't hit someone for shouting shit. However if you punch someone to prevent them from spitting on you after they already spit on you, guess what you are good. But it's okay, Reddit gonna Reddit, stay mad.",

If bad words hurt your feelings enough to physically retaliate at someone, this isn't the job for you. If that's not what literally defines a snowflake, I don't know what does. I've seen police lining up at a protest while people scream insults in their faces, and they stay unflinching.

Now, without knowing much about what the call came in as, The first thing I would have tried to do once I got on scene with a patient like this is put either a face mask or a non rebreather on but guess what, sometimes a patient is too combative to do so or, the patient doesn\u2019t show signs of being erratic right away. \n\nFor those saying use a spit mask, most agencies (at least here in NYC) don\u2019t carry them and haven\u2019t for some time now. \n\nFrom the looks of it, this call came over as an edp (emotionally disturbed person) or it could have been an assault or dispute but with ems on the scene I\u2019m guessing it was most likely and edp call. Both ems and pd have certain protocols that go with these type of calls. \n\nI feel like this needs to be said but I don\u2019t know hot to put it nicely so people don\u2019t get offended so I\u2019m just going to say it.   Anyone who\u2019s not in this line of work needs to step back and chill out. While everyone\u2019s opinion is considered, it\u2019s taken with a grain of salt. You  have zero idea what you\u2019re talking about and zero idea what the job entails. \n\nWith that being said\u2026\u2026 Over the course  of these last six years I\u2019ve been spit at countless times and have NEVER reacted in this manner both pre and during covid. This display of the officers inability to control himself is horrendous and absolutely disgusting. He stooped down to the level of the patient and let it get the best of him. Now, there may be a lawsuit do to his actions. \n\nIt\u2019s s$&@ like that gives BOTH of and ems a bad rap. If you can\u2019t control your emotions while being spit at (regardless of covid or not) this ain\u2019t the job for ya pal. \n\nThere absolutely CANNOT be officers or ems personnel like this in the field, period. I truly hope most of you know that when an EMT or Paramedic comes to you most of us are here to help. \n\nStay safe everyone.",

This one seems like the cop is a dick and let his emotions escape.\n\nHave you talked to cops? They are human just like us. Sure maybe a racist dick hole or somebody who has an inflated ego will get in there every now and again, but generally it's just normal people who want to protect others. I have a question, do you see a 10 second clip of a cop shooting a black person and immediately think \"He's racist\". Do you try to look into what actually happened prior to the shooting? Maybe that black person had killed somebody, maybe the cop saw that they had a hidden gun. What if they escaped after gunning down an officer. What if they were just walking down the road and suddenly were surrounded by police barking orders at him making him confused and scared making him act rashly causing him to make a bad decision and getting shot. Maybe they just happened to run into the racist one and the cop escalated the situation. It could go either way, but you would never know watching that 10 second clip. A lot of people are reactionary, I guess I am too but just going the other way. Unless it's clearly wrong I will usually assume the cop is in the right until proven otherwise. It just seems like you guys don't even give police a chance, just guilty until proven innocent and even then it might still be guilty.\n\nThat was a long one.",

What do you think happens when the lawyers gets a hold of this footage? Now the offender gets off, AND gets paid! All because this dumbass cop couldn't control himself... so like I said, it doesn't matter what happened before. He just let this guy walk, and all us taxpayers get to pay him a few million.

You feel and am proud that you are a good cop. \n\nOne day while on the job with your partner, you decided to swing by the family of the innocent person, from the case where the cop you put in jail, lives. As you approach the house, gun fire rang out and you duck for cover. Your partner of 10+ years, every bit as good a cop a you, a honorary family member alike, gets hit and goes down for good. After a short fire fight, you were able to wound and disable the shooter.\n\nAs ambulance and backup arrives, you stare at the shooter as he is wheeled into the back of the ambulance. This is the person who you protected. This person contributed to the death of your partner despite all the good you did for him. You punch him in the face. \n\nThoughts?  Still no way to justify this?",

It is an inherently broken system that can only have bad apples. As long as there is qualified immunity, blue wall of silence and internal affairs, police will commit crimes. They can\u2019t commit no crimes or other officers won\u2019t trust them not to snitch.

How exactly would an officer get arrested for committing a crime if there is no third party auditing them? Internal affairs are their friends. They all commit crimes so nobody snitches or they will get caught also. If they do snitch, officers retaliate. And if they somehow get to court, they tend to get qualified immunity. They also are friends with judges because they\u2019re around them all day. This officer was suspended with pay but he literally battered a suspect restrained on a gurney being brought into an ambulance. If there was any idea the spit was considered assault or battery, then it\u2019d be self defense and the officer would not be suspended. \n\nOnce again, it isn\u2019t the officers, it is the system. You cannot join it and change it because they retaliate against you or they\u2019d all be caught. You cannot exist within the system and be a good cop, because of what they do to the good cops. The fact that nobody cares about the officers battery is a perfect example of this. \n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2020/06/13/876628281/what-happens-when-officers-blow-the-whistle-on-police-misconduct\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.usatoday.com/amp/8514211002",

This is why in this obvious case of assault and battery caught on camera, the officer only gets suspended with pay. There is no enforcement when police commit crimes so this is why the officer assaults and batters the restrained victim and nobody flinches. They all are clearly not going to snitch or care because they do it to. The bald guy was going to assault him as well. It\u2019s so obvious, but you are willfully ignoring reality. If this system had good apples, somebody would have arrested him. How much clearer can that be? You need to get your brain checked bud.\n\nYou don\u2019t seem to understand it is not every officer magically deciding to be criminals but it is a system that cannot have those who are not criminals.

You are literally saying people should be able to hit others because their little feelings are hurt. You clearly are too sensitive to be a police officer. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter what the person did. This asshole cop is also a criminal. It is very obvious he committed a crime in this video. So now if another cop or person is so offended by this cop beating a helpless person, they should be able to hit him now? Do you see why you can\u2019t let public officials break laws?

The really bad ones tend to end up dealing with law enforcement but some become lawyers, academics, politicians and potentially anything else. \n\nNow some dogs like people are assholes. It's why any good parent teaches their children to not try and pet unfamiliar dogs and about stranger danger.\n\nSome people are stupid assholes and don't realise that their actions may have consequences or don't care. These people abuse other people and do things like spit, assault rape and a whole lot of other bad shit. Every now and then though they try this shit with someone who won't tolerate it. Now when this happens between to civilian human beings and the asshole receives some sort of pain, (a punch or a kick) punishment or incentive not to do it again we say got whatt the asshole got  they deserved. They did something bad and something bad happened to them.\n\nNow cops are people and are held to a higher standard than civilians. But when they go home they are people. Before they were cops they are people and that bloke tied down is also a person. He is a person would have grown up in the same world where if you spit on the wrong person you will receive a consequence. \n\nNow my thinking is that he either :\nA) forgot cops are people who grew up in the same society and doesn't give a shit about how he behaves.\nB) He thought because cops are held to a higher standard so I can spit, shout, harras, threaten and a whole list of other things that would result him being attacked by your average Joe but not from a cop because cops are held to a higher standard.\n\nRegardless of the why he did what he did, the human side of cop came out and he took a single punch for it. Cop should get a disciplinary because they are held.to a higher standard. Asshole who thinks it's okay to spit on people is entitled to fuck all.",

And look at all the \"fuck the police\" hate comments. It applies to them. And I never said the police shouldn't be held to a higher standard. I said what I would do, and I'm not a police officer. I agree you. I also believe that the \"Blue Brotherhood\" should root out all bad cops, whether it be for uncalled for violence, corruption, or whatever. It makes them all look bad. Instead of defending bad cops, they should shun them, turn them in, get them fired, testify against them. That being said, law enforcement officers should be shown respect for what they do, the sacrifices they make, the pressure they are under...unless one specifically shows he is not worthy of that trust. The vast majority want to serve their communities, and go home to their families at the end of shift. Constantly trying to set them up, to make them look bad, to judge them all by the few bad ones, is a mistake and makes the tension so much worse. I see so many videos of people actively seeking confrontation, just so they can argue the law with a police officer. And most the time, the person doing the confrontation is an asshole who thinks he know it all...but doesn't. Respect is a two way street...and just because you SHOULD be able to spit in a cop's face and call him a bitch, with him punching you, that doesn't mean you really should try to get away with it.",
