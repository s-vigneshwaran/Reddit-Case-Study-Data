Now the police are looking for you.\n\nIf you sell them online then eBay and Amazon has seller protection, which means those companies go after you once the buyers report it. \n\nAs someone that buys and flips all kinds of stuff (and has even flipped stolen items unknowingly), this is a situation that I don't think you can use to your benefit. $30,000 is a lot and you can be damn sure Apple is going to find out where their product went.",

The video's description mentions \"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\" (S1 E1), but the animation style indicates that it's a later episode.\n\nEdit: a bit more searching led me to [this article](https://valhallaprivatecap.com/blog/homer-simpson-guide-financing-startup/), which says it's from 1993. In turn, that led me to [this IMDb page](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0701072/characters/nm0144657). If you want the full episode, it's \"Boy-Scoutz 'n the Hood\" (S5 E8).",

He called up the company he ordered from and they barely cared as he was dealing with bottom level staff who just answer the phone.  He called up the shop that should have got the parts and they over the top, OMG like excited.  They needed those parts for customers.  They emailed him a shipping label and scheduled UPS to come to his house.  They said if you need ANYTHING, let us know and we will hook you up.  He said he was thinking about new wheels.  They hooked him up with a wheel/tire combo, free shipping and at like 50% of their cost.",

My brother answered the door and this lady was standing there and handed the envelope with my license in it and explained that it had been delivered to her house...up the road...on the other side of the intersection where the street name actually changes so it wasn't like the mail guy just got the numbers mixed up because they were 2 **completely different street names.** The lady didn't drive but figured it was a close enough walk to bring it directly to my house.\n\nI really hate Canada Post's incompetence.",

I was supposed to send it back unsigned to prove she wasn't living there, because only the intended recipient could sign for it. I told them that sounds like checking for write permission on a file by attempting to write to it and catching the exception, which is obviously a bad practice. They didn't understand. Anyway, two weeks go by, no letter. Then one Friday, lady from the next street over (similar name, same number) says she and her family just got back from a month-long vacation and found the letter in their mailbox. I called up the post office, they said it was signed a week ago, made several attempts to guess the name of the signer before I discovered how to view the signature online. It was a scribble, there was no name there. I took it back to the insurance company and they were like, we were about to close the request since it was signed, but I guess we won't do that again.",

She returned the remaining gc to CVS and they'd issue her a check. Here's where cvs fucked up. They didn't put the unit # on the check. They made the check out to San Diego instead of my ex-wife's name. Yes, it was that dumb.\nSince the check didn't have the correct unit #, damn mailman put it in unit A instead. Unit A cashed the check for $3500, this was illegal because it was not their check. \nAfter a month of tireless phone calls, speaking with cvs rep, they found out the check was cashed at wells Fargo near our place. They sent her a photo of the check. Luckily I recognize the signature and ask my ex-wife to verify with Unit A did they recently cashed a check for $3,500. They said yes because it was in their mailbox. I was like you have got to be fucking shitting me. \nMy ex-wife asked they guy to return the money. Initially, he refused. He said he deposited in his retirement account and can't take it out. My ex-wife said if CVS can't get their money back, they will file a police report. We have all the info of the check. Three days later, the guy wrote a check for $3,500 made it out to my ex-wife's name. \nThis guy is a former police officer and always preached about practicing good moral. Go figure.",

For \u201cnormal\u201d shipments, it depends if they put the actual declared value on the shipment, because UPS will only cover up to $100 of value. Beyond that, the shipping cost goes up unreasonably for business purposes. For example, I\u2019ve shipped probably 1000 laptops via UPS over the last several years, and UPS has lost/damaged a total of 3 with another 5 or 6 recovered in some way (neighbors delivering it correctly, good people returning it to UPS, or UPS picking it back up from the wrong address). \n\nThe added cost if I declared all 1000 of those laptops at their actual value probably would have been enough to buy 20 new machines. So it doesn\u2019t make much sense. It\u2019s priced so people don\u2019t use it.\n\nChances are that companies shipping thousands in car parts will have an actual insurance policy that\u2019s a bit more reflective of the actual loss rate, but that insurance company would definitely be trying to recover the goods before they pay out or would be charging a company a shitload more if their customer service staff were just writing off $7000 shipments like it\u2019s a normal thing to do.",

Packages get misplaced or lost, that's built into the quarterly expectations.\n\nOne of my coworkers fucked up an engine that cost us 10k to fix. We didn't even write him up, because he knew it was stupid, and we make that much off of him every couple of months. Unless he did it again like a month later why in the world would we fire him?

Or is the rationalization \"all big companies are bad, hence Im performing some sort of perverted justice by stealing from a big company, for selfish, non-altruistic purposes\"?\n\nSecond, no where was it mentioned this was a big company. It sounds more like some small to midsize shop so it really could have a negative effect that would be felt.\n\nThis whole idea of keeping something that doesnt belong to you with any of the above rationalizations is crap. Its just you trying to explain away why you shouldnt feel bad for doing something you know is bad",

Goods or services are not considered to have been solicited unless the recipient specifically requested, in an affirmative manner, the receipt of the goods or services according to the terms under which they are being offered. Goods or services are not considered to have been requested if a person fails to respond to an invitation to purchase the goods or services and the goods or services are provided notwithstanding. If the unsolicited goods or services are either addressed to or intended for the recipient, the recipient may use them or dispose of them in any manner without any obligation to the provider, and in any action for goods or services sold and delivered, or in any action for the return of the goods, it is a complete defense that the goods or services were provided voluntarily and that the defendant did not affirmatively order or request the goods or services, either orally or in writing.\r  \n\\[ 1992 c 43 \u00a7 1; 1967 c 57 \u00a7 1.\\]\n\nI can't find anything on misdelivery specifically, this is what pops up.  But since I had to do a decent amount of indepth research for something else, I fully know that I could be using 1 incorrect word and the relevant laws not appearing lol.\n\nMy take comes down to this: If his name and address is on the shipping crate, then yes, as far as the law (here at least) is concerned, it was intended for him, and it would be a gift, and he would have no responsibility to return it or pay for it.  Now, if he wasn't the person it was addressed to, that's a different question I'm not sure of the answer\n\nAlso, lawyer websites can be incorrect easily enough.  Here, the law says that \"slungshots\" are illegal (also known as a monkey's fist, and is essentially a flexible mace, think fullmetal jacket, those socks), but many people incorrectly think it means/says \"slingshot,\" including many lawyer websites.",

Anyways the information is correct.  The OP doesn't legally have to return these ipads and likely can windfall this as a form of income.  OP get with a lawyer to be sure but, absolutely it's precedented that these won't need to be returned.  How common law works is that basically if its been settled in court before future judges will likely deflect to that judgement and rule in the same fashion.\n\nedit: I myself work for a major retailer ;).  A major mistake like this would likely result in an attempt at recovery but you'd be surprised what goes on behind the scenes.  Think like throwing away $10,000 of dollars of merch per day.....",

I used to love small businesses but after working for a few they are plenty willing to screw everyone to make a buck, including the workers.  You don't have to take my word for it but Amazon isn't as bad as they get the rep for.  Or they are, but then we also gotta say there's plenty of people that deserve the bad rep too.  The only thing I'll say about that is that numbers don't lie often and Amazon knows it.  The people that complain the most are the ones that show up to get paid bs show up to work. I'd say at least be somewhere in the middle.  All that said, most of the product Amazon ships it doesn't own.  Amazon isn't really a retailer, they mostly do fulfillment and then added retailing as an afterthought, even then most of the amazon retailing is comingled inventory.  I would suggest googling \"Amazon comingled inventory,\" for a preview on how it works.  You could receive 300 ipads from \"Amazon\" by mistake and still be screwing a small biz either way.",

You still have to follow the rules that were set above.\n\n>\tBe sure to reach out to the company to inform them of the mis-delivery. Give them the chance to come and pick it up.\n\n>\tContact the company twice\u2013and do it in writing in order to provide clear evidence that you gave them the chance to pick it up.\n\n>\tEven after you\u2019ve sold the items, hang on to the cash for a little while longer. The specific laws depend on your state, but the original owner can still claim the money from you for up to six years.\n\n>\tIf you\u2019ve had the package for a while and nobody\u2019s come to pick it up, it doesn\u2019t hurt to make the best of your situation .

That doesn\u2019t mean you automatically get to keep the items.\n\nEdit:\n\nThis is pretty clear:\n\n>\tA person is guilty of theft if the person obtains or exercises control over the property of another that the person knows to have been [...] delivered under a mistake [...] and [...] the person fails to take reasonable measures to return it. Violation of this paragraph is a Class E crime.\n\nIn at least some state law (this is Maine), if you are mistakenly delivered a package meant for someone else and don\u2019t make any attempt to return it, you could be committing theft.",

OP should arguably do everything they can to keep these ipads including contacting a shit load of lawyers because one of them can make that happen.  Also relo is crazy crazy expensive, you might be surprised how much money it could cost a company to attempt retrieval.  Esp considering the legal loops.  Add on the fact they have insurance for this and its not hard to see where OP doesn't have to just submit and give them back.  Many find it easier to submit tho so its up to OP",

This is about U.S. law, I'm not a lawyer just someone who recieved unsolicited goods I wanted to keep before.\n\nAnother caveat to this is that if you choose to keep it, they aren't obligated to send you what they originally meant to send IIRC, so if it's of less value or you would prefer the other thing then it's best to return it.",

This also apply to if they were to send you extra items for example a while ago someone posted on Reddit that they got sent about 50 laptop when he just ordered one. He wasn\u2019t under any obligation to send it back. I think using the word unsolicited was the wrong choice in my part. It would make more sense to say if someone sends you something that\u2019s addressed to you you are under no obligation to tell them or return the item/s.

Anything you make over 81000 (assuming OP is married filing jointly) is taxed at a rate of 22%. So you are actually only getting about 50% when it's all said and done.\n\nEdit: if their personal income puts them into a higher bracket they will have to pay 32% or even 35%.",

Most of the expensive organic stuff is eye level, easily spotted & readily accessible for ur average shopper. I happen to be a short person & I need glasses..heeheehee..I routinely give folks mostly organic whether they order it or not because those are the things I can reach & weighing their meat/produce/specialty cheese..weigh it properly & report said weight..how, I need fkn glasses, I can't see. I just report the weight they requested & keep it moving. They're always over as I don't want to risk shorting someone & well...fk big business. The customer gets the products they requested otherwise it won't scan, it's just more than what they ordered & all organic..courtesy of \"Bamazon\". So yeah..fk big business.",

You may think there\u2019s no recourse, but in reality it\u2019s just not worth it for the retailer. It saves them money to take a \u201cwell get some of it back hassle free and we\u2019ll lose some of it\u201d. \n\nThe recourse is going through the courts which can be costly. It\u2019s a definite slam dunk win for your employer, but it\u2019s not worth the time and money to pursue it. If your company mistakenly sent an entire truckload of goods to someone, you can be damn sure they will get it back because it\u2019s 100% worth it in that case.",

Intentional unordered goods used to be a big issue in the USA. Companies would send out stuff you didn't order hoping you would use it, They would then send a bill a few weeks later, hoping your conscience would convince you to pay for the stuff you already opened and used. The legal principle was never intended to cover pure mistakes. You can certainly make an ethical argument either way (whether it's right for you to just keep it), but misdelivered merchandise is not legally the same as unordered merchandise. \u2013 \nRobert Columbia\n\nThe FTC shit everyone keeps parroting is for when a company INTENTIONALLY sends you shit in an attempt to force a sale on you. In those cases you can keep whatever it is as a gift. It DOES NOT cover mistakes and if you went to court over this you\u2019d get fucked under \u201cunjust enrichment\u201d laws.",

FREEBIE!  all in all i got two 41\" bottom cabinets and a 42\" tower for like $600 total (and at least $400 back in points to use for more free stuff) and my parents got theirs a few days later.\n\nngl...sears fucked up so many of my online orders around that time it's like they were trying to go out of business.  had multiple orders of hand tools partially or fully duplicated or just wrong items sent.  but the best part was you could chat with a rep online and they'd always send out the correct parts asap, upgrade you, or give you a credit for what you didn't receive.  i made out like a bandit 2017-2018 and wasn't even trying to game the system.",

I would be questioned on why I let a package go through that obviously had the wrong weight. \n\nDuring peak though, most of my troubleshooting is cut out and so lots of packages with the above issues are sent out and the building eats the cost.

So unless your restrictions are supertight, theyll download stuff like this and itll charge you. There was like 5 apps that after i looked at the history charged me and i asked for a refund and got it.\n\nBut its their bad in the end.. since they arent policing the store well enough to make sure that apps dont show up in the kids tablet stoe that somehow chare people for the download.\n\nI got all the apps names and hit up customer service chat and got a refund for them all.\n\nBut word of warning to those with the fire tablet for kids with the free kids service that comes with the tablet once you buy it.\n\nIts supposed to be a tablet and case, 2 year break it and replace it warranty no questions asked, and kids \"freetime\" app store where everything is free and then thats that. \n\nBe warned tho.. check your history on your kids tablet and turn on download permissions. That way everything they download sends you an email so you can approve or not. Even still, itll show apps that cost $20 for like an app where its got a cool graphics logo of something, and is just like a ball you click and bam, $20 bucks.\n\nSneaky fucking devs then somehow get that app on the store and it costs the kid that downloads it 20 bucks unless download permissions are set. And then then i approved one that after i approved it i went right back and looked because it looked shady and sure enough, 20 bucks. \n\nAgain i went to the customer service and they helped me out bu i was like yo yalll really need to take our chat convo and have a meeting and realize that heres some people that are circumventing the app store and geting charges through towards the customer in an app store thats supposed to have everything free.\n\nSo just watch out, because some of it aint free and then theyll figh with you a bit about a \"one time\" service of refunding your money since its supposed to be free. They gave me the refund but said it would be the only time.\n\nI let them know if it happened again even tho i look at them all, its still on them and theyll be refunding the money regardless since it clearly states all apps/games/content are free.\n\nTold them id just cancel and return the tablets and just buy ipads since i was really just buying the service honestly since thats just part of the service i could just buy ipads and give my kids x amount per month and do the same thing.\n\ndevs that do this type of shit are garbage as fuck, and the apps they use  to skirt the system are flaky bullshit as welll.",

It would be up to the seller to decide if they want to request injunctive relief to compel them to return it, or cash to make them whole. \n\nOr more likely, settle the matter amicably at their own expense before it ever reaches a courtroom.

But police claim that Memmo obtained the larger flat-screen under false pretense, which would be against the law.\n\nMemmo told WFXT that police swarmed his Freetown home Monday evening before instructing him to come outside, at which time he was cuffed and taken into custody. Having obtained a search warrant, police searched the home and found the larger TV mounted on Memmo\u2019s wall.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMemmo was charged with larceny over $1,200 by false pretense as well as misleading a police officer. We\u2019ve reached out to the Freetown Police Department for more information and will update when we hear back.\"\n\nThis case is different likely because the received product was similar to the one ordered, and likely something not disclosed led to the police coming to this conclusion.  Criminal justice 101 teaches there must be criminal intent alongside criminal act... so this is a bad example of the law not being applied, especially because they mention the law we are arguing as being the norm.  The OP ordered a grill not 200 ipads and got 300 instead.  This was the companies mistake therefore the OP is not legally required to rectify it for them... that's the beauty of the US btw but no one wants to talk about that",

He literally did what he was allowed to according to the FTC. Literally. He wasn't deceptive, he didn't lie, he didn't coerce he didn't do anything that falls under the definition of false pretense.

If not, Then like you said they\u2019d have to dispute it with their credit card\u2026and again it seems like something that would be one person word against the company\u2019s word. Then again I\u2019ve never had to dispute a card charge, so don\u2019t really know how those things work once they have to go to the payment level, or how often the buyer wins cases against the sellers. So I\u2019m just talking out my ass, but I\u2019m guessing there are some unfortunate cases in which the buyer would be screwed and SOL.",

So your entire argument is irrelevant. \n\n>The entire argument is whether this guy had the right to keep the iPads. He didn\u2019t. \n\nMaybe *your* argument is. But the comment we are discussing only talks about the legality of keeping merchandise that the company mistakenly sent to you. \n\nAgain, you are arguing against a claim no one made. \n\n>Still waiting in those posts etc in my profile that make you think I\u2019m not a lawyer. Let\u2019s step outside this conversation to see how deep you went in this little obsession. \n\nI'll just point out the irony that you still haven't given a source or law to support your claim. \n\nIt is not a specific post or anything. Just the fact that you have never said anything about the law before this post, as well as your general way of talking about the law. Even here, I had to explain to you the nuances of the law; you claimed that a direct quote from the FTC was a misinterpretation of the law; you didnt understand the argument of the opposing side; you are arguing against a claim no one made; you misunderstood a government source that was written for a general audience; you don't understand the concept of the burden of proof; you haven't been able to support any of your claims with evidence despite several requests from multiple people; etc. \n\nThere is simply nothing in your entire profile that demonstrates any knowledge of the law beyond a google search.",

[Here](http://departments.bloomu.edu/philosophy/pages/content/hales/articlepdf/proveanegative.pdf) is an article to show you how easy it is to prove a negative claim, including the claim that something does not exist. He even uses Santa as an example.\n\nRegardless, this argument is again irrelevant because just about all of your claims have been *positive* ones, rather than negative ones, including every single claim I asked you to support in the previous post.\n\nNot only are your claims groundless, they would actually *disprove* you. If the company and the shipping agent are considered to be one entity, then it means that a single entity is sending an unsolicited package. Therefore, the recipient is legally entitled to keep it under 39 U.S. Code \u00a7 3009. \n\nSee? That's how you do it. Even though i disagreed with you, i was still making a claim, so I proved my claim by citing the relevant law. If I did not do this, my argument would be groundless. Just like yours is.",

Now lets see these legal sources, especially as they relate to the law I cited... \n\n>39 U.S. Code \u00a7 3009 is not applicable as it intended for prevention of fraudulent acts by private businesses and unwilling consumers, and not legitimate contracts between two parties where there has been a breach of contract causing injury to a third party.

You just work from your own definitions instead of what the courts do.) \n\n>https://www.fierceretail.com/operations/best-buy-s-ipad-dilemma-tricky-world-shipping-errors \n\nIs this the type of evidence you usually cite as a lawyer? Random blog posts? \n\nThat article is an opinion piece in which the author talks about what he thinks is \"probably\" true regarding a separate incident. He does not mention any instance in which the law has been interpreted in any other way than I have described, nor does he mention any law that requiring the items must be returned. \n\nAre you able to fill in these gaps? Are you able to cite any actual *legal* documentation supporting your position, as i have done? \n\n>Also, I do not work in courtrooms. You\u2019re aware most lawyers don\u2019t, right? \n\nOf course courtrooms was just an example, but the general point still stands. You are asserting that a certain action is legally required, but cannot even mention a single law that would require it. Yet, you claim to be a lawyer...",

I already pointed this out [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/facepalm/comments/u9rbx7/comment/i5xstu0/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).\n\nYour response was:\n\n*\"The company employs the shipping agent. Within the confines of a contract it would be considered one entity and the legal issue from the non contractual receiver would between them and the vendor and not the courier. This is pretty basic. The vendor would in turn seek compensation for a breach of contract with the courier, and also the breach between the vendor and the intended receiver.\"*\n\nI challenged you on this, asking for support for these claims. You still have not provided any.\n\nThis is where we are. You made an irrelevant argument, then attempted to make it relevant when I called you out. However were unable to support any of your claims, making your position groundless.\n\nMeanwhile, proved that the comment was accurate by citing the exact law.\n\nSo, I'll ask you again, Mr. \"Lawyer.\" Can you provide any evidence for those claims, or does your argument remain groundless?",

It\u2019s not legal where you live. It is legal here. Please, just stop. Or be a goddamn lawyer you claim to be and show it. Because the federal government themselves says it is legal.",

Items that they did not order. It doesn't *just* apply to something randomly sent to you, nor does it discriminate on quantity. It states you are not required to return things you get but did not order. I would personally make sure the company knew and they returned them safely. But according to that statement by the federal agency tasked with consumer protection I'm going to go with it's not required he return them. You can make the argument that the sentence following the statement \"companies can't send you things and then demand you pay for it\" then it sould state that it only applies in that case specifically. It doesn't. It says you don't have to return unordered merchandise as well. He didn't order 300 ipads, he ordered one grill. Ergo the ipads were unordered merchandise and he's not required to return them.",

People receive things they didn't order but they aren't allowed to keep them.

No because it doesn't happen. \n\nLet me give you a hypothetical. \n\n1. Apple sends you an iPad and demands you pay $1 for it. They can't do that, it's against the law you're quoting. \n\n2. You order an iPad and Apple sends 2. You only paid for one. You don't legally own the second iPad. You don't need to inform Apple but if you assume the rights of ownership then they can legally charge you the full price of the iPad. You can set it aside somewhere secure and wait for them to contact you, you can phone them and give them a reasonable opportunity to collect it or you can drop it off at an Apple store. \n\n3. You order an iPad case and Apple sends you an iPad. The same as 2. You are under no legal obligation to contact them or pay for the iPad *unless* you assume the rights of the owner. \n\n4. You sell an iPad on eBay. In a mix-up you drop the iPad at the wrong house. \nAre you suggesting that the person you delivered the iPad to now gets a free iPad and you're out of pocket several hundred dollars?\n\nThirdly, your majesty.

My bad.\n\n>I can't prove a negative.\n\nBecause one doesn't exist. There is no wording in there that separates quantity, who sent it, how it was sent and where it was delivered that means you do or do not own something. If you are shipped something you didn't order, it's yours. In this case I would have absolutely informed them of a mistake. If amazon sends me two Xbox when I ordered only one, tough shit for them.\n\n>This happens up and down the country on a daily basis. People receive things they didn't order but they aren't allowed to keep them.\n\nThey are. I honestly don't know why you say they can't when it's written in black and white they are. You're telling me my understanding is wrong, that's it. It's consumer law in the US, linked from the federal agency that enforces that law.\n\n>You don't legally own the second iPad.\n\nYes you do. There is nothing that disallows a discrepancy in quantity. This is the problem where you people are saying it doesn't apply. It does. Quantity is not relevant.\n\n>You don't need to inform Apple but if you assume the rights of ownership then they can legally charge you the full price of the iPad.You can set it aside somewhere secure and wait for them to contact you, you can phone them and give them a reasonable opportunity to collect it or you can drop it off at an Apple store.\n\nNo they can't. Where you live that might be true, but not in the US. You aren't actually showing this to be true, you're repeatedly *insisting* that it's true when literal black and white statements do not make an except for this.\n\n>Are you suggesting that the person you delivered the iPad to now gets a free iPad and you're out of pocket several hundred dollars?\n\nYes, the law also doesn't disallow the law being applied if you have a small business, a large business or a mom and pop shop. If you believe to be different ***show the law that says you can't***. It's not proving a negative, the law says anything delivered to you that you didn't order is yours to keep. You're saying that's wrong and I'm interpreting it wrong. Show me where this isn't true.\n\nEdit:\n\nHere are six cases where a person was delivered something they didn't order and were allowed to keep them.\n\n[1]https://consumerist.com/2015/12/23/williams-sonoma-wasnt-really-running-a-buy-one-knife-get-99-free-sale/index.html),[2](https://consumerist.com/2014/07/29/walmart-sends-me-4-extra-ipods-doesnt-want-them-back/index.html),[3](https://www.consumerreports.org/consumerist/amazon-sends-me-someone-elses-order-why-dont-they-care-if-i-send-it-back/),[4](https://consumerist.com/2014/09/22/lululemon-sends-customer-19-extra-running-hats-lets-him-keep-them/index.html),[5](https://consumerist.com/2012/12/05/when-we-ordered-one-ipad-and-best-buy-sent-five/index.html),[6](https://consumerist.com/2012/12/06/hey-best-buy-also-sent-me-five-ipads-when-i-ordered-one/index.html) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom [this](https://legalbeagle.com/6769490-furniture-lemon-laws.html) source it repeatedly states the receiver is allowed and has no obligation to return anything to you that you sent by mistake, sent the wrong amount or sent it to the wrong person. They can ask, but you have no requirement to agree to it.\n\n\\>If the unordered item was an incorrect fulfillment of an order the   \ncustomer did place, you are legally required to send the correct item or  \n refund the customer's money in full -- including shipping costs. You   \ncan ask the customer to return the item, but he has no legal obligation   \nto do so.",

In 99% of shipped items, probably.  Getting ten t-shirts from Amazon, a box of dog treats from Chewy, or a bottle of lotion from Walmart.  Absolutely.  It isn't worth the merchants time to pay or inconvenience you to send it back.  They'll just send another.\n\nBut for 300 iPads?  A several thousand dollar treadmill?  A pre-build PC?\n\nI'd imagine with valuable shipped goods, the merchant and shipper will work to determine what and where the mistake occured.",

And, charitable organizations can send you merchandise and ask for a contribution. You may keep such merchandise as a free gift.\nSometimes, you might sign up for a free trial, only to discover that the company starts sending you products every month, and billing you. That might be a scam. Learn about free-trial scams and what to do if it happens to you.",

I mean, none of them are going to be \"dude keeps 300 iPads and goes to jail.\"  That isn't often how legal research goes.  But simply looking over the citing references for the UMR returns:\n\n2021 WL 1721589.  FTC and Commonwealth of PA going after American Furniture Systems Inc. for violations of the UMR and other unfair business practices.  Judge denied defendants MTD.  Case is ongoing.\n\n2015 WL 1650914 - FTC is granted summary judgment against \"instant response systems\", who were apparently scamming elderly by sending them life-alert style products and demanding payment.\n\n628 F.3d 1175 - held that copyright owner did not create license, but rather conveyed title to recipients of promotional CDs.  Illustrative discussion about unordered merchandise. (note: purposefully sending out a purposeful item to recipients.  Not mistakes.)\n\nScrolling through all of the citing references there is a common theme - businesses behaving badly by trying to trick customers.  That is what is at issue with the FTC rule.  Not granting windfalls to random consumers who benefit from the mistakes of shippers or sellers.",

Lets say its by a shipper further up the line.  Two packages in front of him, mixes up which shipping sticker goes on which box.\n\nEach of the individuals gets a windfall despite the clear mistake?  Are they also entitled to the original thing they ordered?  How far down the chain does the windfall go?  Where can the mistake happen and be acceptable?",

He was sent something he didn\u2019t order by the company, not what he ordered. Although that\u2019s not what happened, if you are delivered something you didn\u2019t order, the rule still applies because it stop mail order scams. That\u2019s why this law exists. \n\n>\tHell, look at it this way.  SOMEONE ordered those iPads.  They were ordered by someone.  So they are not unordered.\n\nOkay. I see the issue here. You can read, but you can\u2019t understand. The law applies TO YOU. Something YOU didn\u2019t ordered is delivered TO YOU is free to keep. Or return. Either way, it\u2019s unordered BY YOU. If the company doesn\u2019t send you what you ordered they are required by law to send another or refund you in full. That does not prohibit you from keeping the other item. \n\n>\tUnordered merchandise is merchandise that NO ONE KNEW was coming.  \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter. The law is that you were supposed to be delivered something. You didn\u2019t receive it but got something else. That isn\u2019t what you ordered and that\u2019s what was sent. You did not order it, the company made the mistake. You are not liable for their mistake, you dont have to correct that mistake and legally you are allowed to keep it. If they send you 500 of something and not 50, that extra 450 items were not ordered but delivered. You are not required by law to correct that mistake, you are legally protected if you keep the other 450. You don\u2019t even have to tell the company they fucked up. \n\n>\tSome fly-by-night company is finding your grandmas mailing address and sending her a knock off LifeAlert then pestering her into paying exorbitant prices.\n\nWhich is exactly what that covers. Seriously, read the damn link. It literally addresses this. \n\n>\tTHAT is unordered merchandise.\n\nAnything you receive but is not what you ordered is I order merchandise. It covers something showing up out of the blue, or being sent the wrong thing. You\u2019re fixating on your definition of unordered and it\u2019s incorrect to the law.",

Seems pretty easy to make a case that they knew they were opening mail which was not intended for them.\n\nhttps://www.encyclopedia.com/articles/what-is-the-federal-law-for-opening-mail-not-addressed-to-you/\n\n>Even though you accidentally opened another person\u2019s mail, your actions after doing so will dictate if you have committed a crime. If you decide to throw the piece of mail into the trash, you have committed a crime as that action has intentionally obstructed and stopped the delivery process relating to that correspondence. In fact, you can be charged for taking that action.\n\n>If you unintentionally open an envelope that is not addressed to you, it is best to write \u201creturn to sender\u201d or \u201cdelivered to wrong address\u201d by the person\u2019s name who the envelope should be delivered to. By taking this action, the USPS will recognize the mistake and redeliver the letter to the correct person\u2019s address. \n\nOf course, this is for USPS.

Five!\n\nAnd yes, those consumers, by law, could keep each and every item.\n\nNow what happens if an item turns up on your doorstep and it wasn't a double of something you ordered, but rather it was sent to your home in error?\n\nYou can probably keep this, too, because the FTC's \"Business Guide to the FTC's Mail, Internet, or Telephone Order Merchandise Rule\"\u00a0says a seller must get a customer's \u2018prior express agreement\u2019 to receive the merchandise.\n\n\u2018Customers who receive unordered merchandise are legally entitled to treat the merchandise as a gift,\" the guide says, noting that businesses cannot try to get payment for the item, nor can businesses demand the item be returned.\u2019\u201d\n\nhttps://www.nj.com/business/2016/12/bamboozled_if_a_retailer_sends_you_stuff_by_mistak.html",

What matters is that the OP ordered something but was wrongly sent an incorrect item. In that case the OP can keep whatever merchandise they were sent. \n\nThis follows the intent of that law. Again, we\u2019re going off of the iPads being sent to OP with their name and address. Let\u2019s say the OP wants to keep this merchandise even though they didn\u2019t order it, and the seller wants it back. How would the seller go about getting it back? They could attempt to sue since OP doesn\u2019t want to give it up. This forced the OP to spend money on this suit, and have to give back the merchandise and pay for any damages, shipping, etc. \n\nWhy would this law care about this scenario? Well what if businesses are constantly sending out merchandise people didn\u2019t order (along with real orders to look good if found out) and then sue or try to get them to pay them when they don\u2019t want to give the merchandise back? I would say part of the intent of this law is to stop this practice. So in this case if the OP received a bunch of iPads sent to them with their name and address on the packages, this would count as unordered merchandise and they could keep them as if they were a gift.\n\n\nHere\u2019s even more links all saying the same thing. \n\nReceiving the Wrong Item\nIf the unordered item was an incorrect fulfillment of an order the customer did place, you are legally required to send the correct item or refund the customer's money in full -- including shipping costs. You can ask the customer to return the item, but he has no legal obligation to do so.\n\nhttps://legalbeagle.com/6769490-furniture-lemon-laws.html\n\nYes, there\u2019s the ethical side to consider (and we recommend notifying the company of the error, which can actually still work out in your favor), but as far as the law is concerned, you\u2019re allowed to keep anything that\u2019s sent to you, even if you didn\u2019t order it.\n\nhttps://lifehacker.com/you-re-allowed-to-keep-products-retailers-accidentally-1789443602/amp\n\nYour Rights When You Get Unordered Merchandise\nBy law, companies can\u2019t send unordered merchandise to you, then demand payment. That means you never have to pay for things you get but didn\u2019t order. You also don\u2019t have to return unordered merchandise. You\u2019re legally entitled to keep it as a free gift.\n\nhttps://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/what-do-if-youre-billed-things-you-never-got-or-you-get-unordered-products#unordered",

Do it, please.\n\n> What if you received a shipment of iPads sent to your name and address, could you legally keep them. The answer to that is yes.\n\nIF AND ONLY IF it was unordered merchandise.  Lets say Apple decides that old attorney demyst is a rube.  They're gonna get one over on me.  They send my office a pallet of iPads straight out of the blue and then send me an invoice.  They will not accept returns and instead demand I pay them for it.  THAT IS UNORDERED MERCHANDISE.  NO ONE ORDERED IT.  THE MERCHANT IS TRYING TO FORCE IT ON ME AND EXTORT ME INTO PAYING IT.\n\nOP is not in that situation.  OP is in a situation where they ordered an item and the wrong item was delivered due to a shipping error.  SOMEONE ELSE ORDERED IT.  OP ORDERED ANOTHER ITEM.  A.  Mistake.  Happened.  \n\nHell, even if OP ordered 1 iPad but the ditzy intern at Apple accidentally added a zero and OP received 10.  OP ordered an iPad.  OP received 10 iPads - 9 by mistake.  Those 9 are not *unordered* within the meaning of the statute.  Apple can request OP return the 9 windfall iPads at Apple's expense.\n\nI don't understand this shower fantasy of windfalls.  If the law works this way - FIND A CASE.  I've ponied up several federal cases using the FTC rule.  Again, if your interpretation of the law was so ubiquitous, then there should be amble case law and examples of state laws being deemed unconstitutional or convictions being overturned.  Find it.  Show me.\n\nActually, don't.  Look, we obviously have different life experiences and education and outlooks.  Your interpretation is different than mine.  I encourage you to please test this and report back.  We're not going to change eachothers mind, so we just need to leave it at that.  We've spent way too much time on something so pointless.",

Well, that\u2019s not quite true. His mother ordered one iPad, and had it shipped to him. What arrived on their doorstep was a very large and heavy box that was big enough to hold five iPads. Because it did.\n\n\u2018What do we do? What would most people do? We did some Internet research and came up with a lot of instances of people notifying companies and those companies thanking them, giving them gift cards, etc. But we couldn\u2019t find an instance where the wrong product was such an expensive item and with such a large quantity.\n\nEventually we found a document from the FTC that said if an incorrect package was shipped to you, you can consider it a gift. Is this true? Can we keep these five iPads?\u2019\n\nThat\u2019s true. Legally, anything that is shipped to your home is yours to keep. This is in order to prevent companies from shipping you merchandise that you never asked for, then hounding you for the money. So they\u2019d be well within their rights to keep or sell the iPads, or even hit them with sledgehammers if that\u2019s what they feel like doing.\u201d\n\nhttps://consumerist.com/2012/12/05/when-we-ordered-one-ipad-and-best-buy-sent-five/index.html\n\nAgain, everywhere I look is the same, it doesn\u2019t matter if you get more of the same thing you ordered, or got something you didn\u2019t order, in both cases you can keep it as long as it\u2019s your name and address on the shipping label.

I've asserted the FTC rule stands for X interpretation and provided several federal cases illustrating that interpretation.\n\nYou've asserted the FTC rule functions as, essentially, a defense to theft.  The onus is on you to provide a primary source, and as yet you've just provided articles from the consumerist and other .com's.\n\nYou don't have the \"FTC and loads of examples.\"  I have federal case law, the federal register illustrating legislative intent, and COMMON SENSE understanding of the statute.  It is YOUR TURN to come up with a primary source for your assertions.  I've already done so.  \n\nLook, jesus.  We're apparently not going to agree. So stop . . . just stop.  Agree to disagree, or put up some sources on the level of mine.  Report back when you've received a shipment of 300 iPads, kept them, and gotten a directed verdict at trial citing the UMR.  Until then, there is nothing else to discuss.  We're done.  Thanks again for the discussion.",

But if you do the smart thing and keep your mouth shut, the company has three months to discover their screw-up and collect the incorrect/excess item/s. Also at their own expense. The receiver has no legal obligation to make that written notification.\n\nSo you can do the ethical and right thing and notify them and possibly get some free stuff, or you can keep quiet and almost certainly get some free stuff. Either way, as long as you don\u2019t damage the item or prevent it from being collected by the people the company sends, then there\u2019s no legal consequences to you.",

In my everyday job I manage a district\u2019s devices and this is exactly how they send them to us. BE CARFUL AND DO NOT SELL THEM! they could be MDM locked. MDM stands for \u201cMobile Device Management\u201d which is software that can remotely manage the device. When a company or school who uses an MDM orders devices like these, typically the serial numbers for each of them are added to their database before delivery. So, if you sell these, and a device is turned on, it could be remotely managed and identity it\u2019s location which could cause you a lot of problems. Your best bet would be to contact Apple and get the iPads to their rightful owner. They can track the serial number of each device and help you return them. Hope this helps!",

I put the sticker on the old one and put it outside my apt door (i wasn\u2019t carrying it back down). So day after new one arrives, it stops connecting to the internet. I contact amazon, same shit, they send a new one with a return label, i put the second one on top of the first one in the hall. So i install the third one. 2 days later, two more show up. The ups guy is like \u201cdude, i\u2019m not going up to get the packages, you have to bring them down, i\u2019m also not refusing delivery and taking these two more back so they\u2019re yours\u201d.\n\nSo i put the new ones on top of the old ones by my door because i don\u2019t want to get in trouble with the landlord. So i\u2019m talking to amazon, getting escalated. This guy just doesn\u2019t get what i\u2019m talking about. I tell him that i\u2019m trying to return these things and the ups guy isn\u2019t taking them. Says i\u2019m sorry, sends me a return label. I\u2019m confused because everything has a return label. \n\nTurns out the dude sent me a return label for the one i wanted to keep. And guess what showed up two days later. Finally the landlord made me take them inside my 350 square foot apt and it became furniture for my now wife and i for a couple of weeks while i tried to figure it out. We ended up selling the 400 dollar air conditioners to the neighbors for 50 bucks a piece, except the dented one (that went out for free) just because i didn\u2019t know what the fuck to do and i tried..\n\n\nI also got a random box of tampons with my zip ties once. And two sets of wheel spacers.",

Package arrives 2 weeks later in a box no bigger than 2x2\u2019. Immediately I knew something was up since you don\u2019t break good clubs down. Open the box and find a $500 baby stroller in the packaging. \n\nEnded up reaching out to both the seller and shipping company, UPS. They had no explanation and told me to keep the stroller or throw it away. eBay refunded my money and the seller lost out on my $250 and UPS reimbursed him the $150 to ship the clubs. He didn\u2019t even realize how much it would cost the ship clubs so the dude, who was in college and selling clubs his parents bought him, ended up losing a ton of money. While some soon to be father received a new set of sick titelist AP3s for a decent price instead of a stroller. \n\nTL;DR: Made $400 trying to buy used golf clubs and buy insurance on expensive shipments.",

Let\u2019s just say, based off of the shipping error, it\u2019s likely for a business as retail usually uses direct shippers, not FedEx. \n\nMost businesses are likely to buy large bulk at lowest possible price so I\u2019m going to assume these are the 64Gb, especially since they are the standard ipad. \n\nMeaning at retail you have $98,700 worth of iPads right there.",

They came to my door and told me they delivered it to the wrong place a couple days after delivery. They told me it\u2019s not their problem and I need to get it back since someone signed for the delivery while admitting but not even saying sorry for delivering it to the wrong address.\n\nThat house was filled with metheads and frequently takes in homeless people. I went over and asked for it back. No response but obviously people were home. Finally after a week of trying I got a guy to talk to me through a tiny cracked door. I politely told him I know they delivered it here and I\u2019d like it back please. They said they didn\u2019t know what I was talking about and slammed the door in my face. \n\nI filed a claim with UPS and they said they couldn\u2019t refund me for my purchase or do anything and I would have to file a police report. I\u2019m sorry what? You dropped it off at the wrong place and can\u2019t take ownership of your actions? I\u2019m not filing a police report on neighbors that already throw needles in my driveway weekly and could very potentially damage my property for far more than the gear was worth. \n\nIn the end I had to stoop to their level and I filled out a piece of paper I taped to their door with the invoice for the items and confirmation email from ups saying it was signed for by their address. It also said I\u2019d be filing a police report in 7 days if they weren\u2019t returned which I wasn\u2019t going to act on in reality. Low and behold when I got home from work the next day there was an opened box on my front doorstep with all my gear. Every item had been opened, rifled through, and many items scratched up. Everything accounted for I think. but I always felt I was missing some little attachment pieces and such. \n\nI had to cancel a photo shoot I needed the gear for as it took a month longer to get everything back. So I was out money now too. \n\nFuck UPS, but just know that the iPad owners could file a complaint against your for UPS\u2019s shitty mistakes they will push off on their customers.\n\nEdit: spelling",

I get an email 2 Days later saying my order is ready so I go back to Lowe's thinking maybe I forgotten a part of my order. Nope, they had 50 more boards ready for me to pick up, the screws and everything else I ordered and picked up already. I seriously had to debate internally whether or not to take that order, then return it, get my money back and a free deck. In the end I came clean and said I had already picked up my order and that this was a mistake. The manager thanked me for my honesty and gave me a free box of screws that have been sitting in my garage now for over a year because I used like six of them.",

If they want to make it right and you block that and you want to keep the wrong item that was sent without paying for it good luck in the courts.

Google it yourself.\n\nA solicitation is an order. Did I order product A? No. I ordered product B. I am under zero, zip, nada, no legal obligation to return product A because I did not order it. I did not solicit it. I solicited product B to be delivered to my home, which is not what the retailer did. The FTC considers product A to be a gift. I'm not obligated to return product A even if the retailer sends me packaging and has UPS or FedEx show up on my doorstep to collect it. Sorry, no, go pound sand.\n\nIf the retailer tried to send me to a collection agency, I would be all over his ass because that's a big no-no. If the retailer tried to charge my credit card for product A, I would easily obtain a chargeback from my credit card company. The CC company is going to want to know one thing: Did I order product A? No, no I did not. Been there. Done that. You are wrong.\n\nAt best, the retailer can refuse to do business with me in the future, and cancel my still unfilled order for product B.",
