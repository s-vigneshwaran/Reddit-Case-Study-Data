I imagine it would have been fuckier if flynn hadn\u2019t been booted after a month\n\nmy pet theory is that trump traded erdogan a large chunk of kurdish northern syria for the location of ISIS leader al-baghdadi. dude turned out to be in a jihadist-occupied region of Syria that Turkey has a presence in, as they support all the jihadists except ISIS (officially, at least).\n\na couple weeks before the strike on al-baghdadi, the US convinced the kurdish forces they were embedded in to demolish their border fortifications facing an increasingly threatening Turkey as a show of good faith. then like 3 days later, Trump suddenly withdrew embedded American forces from the border and Turkey\u2019s forces invaded over the now largely defenseless border, capturing 1600 square miles in a week.\n\nthen al-baghdadi gets blown up!\n\nthe CIA was very forthcoming to the new york times about all these different intelligence avenues that led them to the safehouse. I generally don\u2019t believe the CIA when they\u2019re that forthcoming.\n\nTrump has to be getting *something* for evacuating troops from the border region (i.e doing exactly what Erdogan wanted). There was never a good public explanation of what, though. \n\nTurkey keeping their ISIS guy on ice and trading him for a giant chunk of new territory is a simpler explanation than the CIA\u2019s and also explains the troop evacuation.",

The notion that \u201cit\u2019s not that religion itself is inherently bad\u201d is absurdly false to the point of astonishment.\n\nReligion, is by nature, an affront to the natural world, completely used as a tool to subvert our sciences and discoveries to march its agenda forward.\n\nIt\u2019s a tool to control, yes, and that could be considered just a \u201cmicro\u201d criticism.\n\nIt\u2019s also a moldable entity (pick and choose what/when is needed for control) that subjugates the mind with limitless personal, social and political license, to steam roll over anything and anyone that doesn\u2019t fall in line.\n\nIt has destroyed cultures and entire civilizations in its name. It has divided families. Attempts to controls everything: in many cases who can be your friends, or your spouse. Be convicted of \u201cthought crime\u201d. Commands you to accept its teachings on \u201cfaith and belief\u201d alone, without a shred of empirical proof. It\u2019s responsible for lowering women below men. It promoted some of the most barbaric, backwards practices and traditions throughout time. *The list goes on and on\u2026*\n\nSo to say religion isn\u2019t \u201cinherently bad\u201d, doesn\u2019t just border on insulting, it\u2019s down right goddamn despicable.\n\n***\u201cReligion is poison because it asks us to give up our most precious faculty, which is that of reason, and to believe things without evidence.\"***\n\n- Christopher Hitchens",

That can easily be siloed through many pathways in this debate.\n\nSure, the concept applies. Empires have risen and fallen throughout history.

The message from a \u201cGod(s)\u201d will always carry more weight, fear and obedience than any man could dream of. Which is why it is the greatest weapon we\u2019ve ever created.\n\nHas any authoritarian structure persuaded people to leave they\u2019re families forever? And commanded one to denounce a spouse for not believing? To dismiss and argue against science or the natural world? To convince people in ridiculous mind-boggling stories and have them believe all the above 100% (to the very core of one\u2019s being) and willing to lay their life on the line at a moments notice? No. \n\nThe Aztecs had to tear open a human chest cavity every day just to make sure that the sun would rise.

Religions throughout history have taken many many forms that it's silly to lump them all together in such broad terms.

I would challenge anyone, anyone at all to put forth any other \u201cthing\u201d in our known history to cause the amount of scorched earth devastation that religion is single-handedly responsible for.\n\nYou cannot, because it simply does not exist. From right where we are today, going back to just a few thousand years in our past. Neither greed, lust for power, separation by class or race, or cultural divide (although in most cases by causality, they are *rooted in religion* hence \u201cindirectly\u201d) has come close to the devastation religion itself has caused.\n\nFor anyone that is so much as a religious apologist, after just a surface amount of honest and unbiased research, you would almost certainly reverse your view.",

I'm not one to blame only and totally guns existing for murder happening, and similarly I don't feel that characterizing religion as entirely responsible for all things done in its name is necessarily correct. Religion is just a tool used by the powerful to keep others in check; and with rising secularism we have been starting to see the other altars at which man will sacrifice fellow man in the name of fear, such as genetics based supremacy, economics, wrongthink, etc. \n\nJust as guns are a highly developed weapon for killing people, religions can be a highly developed weapon for controlling a populace, and like most authoritarian entities, this leads to harm other areas. Just like guns, it's not appropriate (in my opinion) to blame guns on gun based violence occurring. OFC lessening the amount of guns and increasing education on them and against them will lead to a net societal benefit, but the base motivation to hurt using tools/weapons will still exist. It's valid to work to limit the convenience therein, but it's being used as a tool when it's used for harm.\n\nTo be sure, though, religion has afforded in some areas more harm than simple xenophobia would account for, but I would posit that it is again a symptom of the blind and unsupervised authority afforded by it and the consequences on human behavior when this happens, rather than an inherently quality of religion itself. These harms are a symptom of a symptom\n\nThis may be a meaningless distinction and I might have fallen into a useless circular pattern of \"it's a tool until it has blind authority but at that point it's a symptom of the blind authority rather than itself\" and im sorry if I have im still trying to learn. I also realize that I misspoke in my last sentence up there, yeah religion is probably the worst human psyche tool, I should have said that it's not the \"worst human psyche existential product\". Fear of the other/unknown being the worst product of the human mind, and religion being the deadly tool wielded by that production to do so march harm throughout history.\n\nIn short I agree that utilizations of religion have been bad, and that religion existing has been a net negative (both of these are understatements) but I think that there are baser instincts at play that can be corralled by evil forces secularly if we are not vigilant.",

Common people are not 'sacrificing each other' at the 'altar' of economics. I don't even know what you think 'wrongthink' is, but yeah you get uninvited from Christmas dinner if you spout bigoted shit or medical misinformation.

Or how Jewish people claim to be the chosen people of God? \n\nWhat specifically do you mean?\n\n>then why point it out yourself? \n\nI didn't. You are confusing my criticism of religion, which is what I wrote, with some kind of promotion of anything else. Religion gets good people to often do bad things. I just made several examples. There is very little evidence that it stops bad people from doing bad things.\n\n>idk the red scare got pretty close, what with all the curtailing of rights to speech. regardless, it's certainly much less likely at the time being, but it exists elsewhere in society.\n\nIt doesn't exist. Your best evidence was an example from half a century ago that never rose to the level of your original claim. Freedom of speech is very robust right now. Unfortunately people seem to forget that it only applies to the government punishing you for your speech, and not that the rest of society has to tolerate or encourage it.",

More often than not those who rise to power will manipulate others to get there, dwindling the candidacy of altruistic leaders. Atheism isn\u2019t without its manipulative leaders either and it\u2019s important we recognize this, as some think atheism is a \u2018bash chrsitianity\u2019 safeplace. Abrahamic religion makes up a small subset of religions and spirituality as a whole, and contrarians to religion have always existed and claimed a large audience. To think one form of thought is better than another is exactly the type of pitfall that \u2018Christian fundamentalists\u2019 are being accused of within this very thread.

They think that we're going to be okay since the majority of the country isn't that crazy.\n\nBut Fascism doesn't need a majority of the country in order to win.  A very motivated and violent minority can make it happen.  In Germany in 1932, only 37% of voters supported the Nazi Party, but that was enough for them to take over.  In the United States, the political party which is in bed with the Fascists controls half of Congress (50% of the Senate and 49% of the House of Representatives).  We're in trouble.",

You gather with the other people of your small community and spend some time together, even if it's in silence, and you get to know each other. A church is like a club. \n\nThese days the towns we live in are getting bigger and bigger, so we're losing the ability to know the people in our geographic areas. Instead, we find community in other places like video game communities, forums, sports teams, etc. We're creating social substitutes for the social experience religion used to solely give people. I always say that one of the main reasons WoW got so popular is that it gave young men a small community to be a meaningful member of, just like how a church would've given a baby boomer adult a purpose and meaning in their small community. \n\nBasically, we've outgrown the need for religion as a social endeavor.",

                          "text": "You cannot kill an idea, and nazis are a perfect example of this... otherwise the ideology would've ended with WWII. An ideological threat is an intellectual issue (which, in the American case, is the decades-long christian-led theocratic/fascist takeover, which overlaps all too much with nazism itself). The only possible solution is intellectualism itself. We must somehow educate the masses to *innoculate* the masses. Perhaps effectively illuminating the threat for what it is would be a good start.\n\nReligious freedoms are important, but clear distinctions should be made between protecting your right to *practice a religion* and attempting to *politically force society to adhere to those beliefs*. This is ultimately the issue we face. How we go about reversing this\u2014considering the sheer vastness of christianity and the depths of the christian cult's penetration into our society\u2014is quite literally a multi-billion dollar question. The amount of wealth involved equates to power and this will not be easy to solve.\n\nI believe we start with reaffirming the separation between church and state. To begin this process, churches need to be taxed considering this is the primary vehicle of funding for these literal democratic terrorists. This will serve multiple purposes: \n\nIt opens them up to financial auditing to ensure they're not funneling money to politics; it dents their overall capacity for doing so; and, finally, will pave the way to creating new laws to penalize religious organizations for even *trying* to sway politics (and allow even stiffer penalties for cases where it's proven they've done so successfully). It will also provide much needed tax revenue, to boot.\n\nAs someone else noted, we must also install laws protecting society from nefarious misinformation. For example, there should be laws preventing a politician from outright claiming election fraud which erodes confidence in democracy itself. This should be rightfully classified as a threat to national security and taken as seriously as this classification implies.\n\nIt is one thing to ask for a recount or to responsibly voice concern\u2014but it's an entirely different scenario to, as Trump did, assert with *certainty* that an election \"was stolen\" without sufficient evidence to make such a claim. *Even then*, such a claim should be limited to courtrooms which is the only place legitimacy of such accusations can be formally investigated, weighed and resolved. Openly spouting this nonsense is exponentially more dangerous than fallaciously screaming fire in a movie theater as I hope we've learned after Jan 6.\n\nWhile the American Constitution is a wonderful foundation, ironically, the rights granted can also be it's own greatest threat. Freedom of speech protects even the most calculated attacks against itself, for example. While I'd never suggest it's outright removal it, there should be distinct clauses with tangible consequences for irresponsible speech as in the above example. Currently there are so few instances where organizing literal sedition is a prosecutable offense because of these broad and nearly limitless protections.",

Since conservatives are big on tradition, it doesn't seem like they'd have any issue with removing it completely, since that was its traditional form.\n\nEdit: added content",

There is a reason they listed this one first in the bill of rights. It was listed based off importance. The first amendment is why our nation was created, and why we were able to get where we are. I feel like the right wants to go back to former England, pre revolutionary war. Have a king. Have no rights. You do what your told or its capital punishment while constantly quoting the Constitution. It's so weird and unsettling. Its literally our fucking \"freedom\" clause in the Constitution.",

Even politicians on the left are religious, which strikes me as particularly odd.\n\nIs all this extreme religion, like we're seeing in Texas with the abortion stuff, just the zealots over reaction to decreasing influence and will eventually stop?\n\nWhy doesn't the majority (who I assume aren't zealots) punish this sort of behavior from people who are in government or are aspiring to get into government?",

No, I mean *exactly.* Because I don't think Catholicism or Russian or Greek Orthodoxy is in your version of Christianity. There are probably a whole bunch of Protestant flavors you and your jackboot brigade find unpalatable. In fact, a unified state religion in the US like the one you want would require a host of features no current denomination offers. \n\nSo what you're advocating for is a religion whose doctrine doesn't yet exist. It would certainly be Dominionist and patriarchal and racist prosperity gospel, with ownership of slaves and women back on the table. It would have to be light on the details to work for the various pale shades of old white men. I think, since the only thing they can fully agree on is Trump, he'll probably be anointed at some point here in the next few months.",

He believed that government should absolutely be ruled by religion and Puritanical values.\n\nThen comes along one of his ministers Roger Williams.\n\nWilliams sees how Natives are treated, how Jews are treated, how other non-Christians (Puritans) are treated in Winthrop's Shining City, and he starts preaching a different way . . . About inclusion, about helping all people, no matter their \"birth status.\"\n\nWinthrop gets pissed and exiles Williams (bit alows him to hang out for the winter so he doesn't die.)\n\nWilliams goes off to found the Rhode Island colony, where the guiding principle is *religious freedom.*\n\nThese two ideas were the spark of what we see today.  \n\nWinthrop writes an essay called \"A Modell of Christian Charity,* wherein he describes how a Christian should live and how they should give to the community.  It is easy to read this essay as \"oh, look at how *charitable and good* these people are,* but of you read closer, be describes the community as the community of Puritans . . . So, It's really a document about how Christians should treat *each other.*\n\nSorry if this ruins your idea of modern media turning neighbor against neighbor.  Christians in this country have been doing that shit for 400 years.",
