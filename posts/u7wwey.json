  "text": "TIFU by thinking my son was having gay sex when he was just eating Hummus\nSo I (39F) have a son (15M) and he brought a friend round today.\n\nThey immediately went to their room and I assumed they would just play some video games or whatever so I was totally fine leaving them. \n\n It was about 30 minutes in when I was walking past, I heard sounds such as 'Omg that's so good' and 'Its so good with that in it' and various 'mmmm' sounds.\n\nIt really sounded like they were having gay sex, I was super weirded out by it so I quickly went downstairs and waited for his friend to leave. When this friend left an hour or two later I asked my son what they were doing in his room (because although I don't mind him being gay, and ik it's normal for teenagers to have sex, a condom really should be used) so I planned to confront him about that.\n\nHowever the answer shocked me to my very core. They weren't having sex, they were _eating hummus_.\n\nI was shocked, and initially didn't believe it. We had never had hummus before and I asked him to show me the hummus if this was true. So he did, and I ate hummus for the first time, and oh my god was it good. We experimented with different things in it like bread and carrots and it was great. Apparently his friend had heard about how he had never had hummus before and thought this was absurd so had planned a date for a hummus party.\n\nSo yeah, it ended up being quite a good ending, i discovered how nice hummus was.\n\n\nTLDR: Thought my son was having gay sex, he just really liked hummus.",

It's, \"so my lady friend and I were doing the ole horizontal tango, and she was in the middle of polishing the candle stick, if you will. I had her love sacks in my face and was licking the cherry off the ice cream Sunday, if you know what I mean. Then suddenly my mom burst through the locked door (it makes sense because we play a game where we act like mission impossible characters and stealthily pick locks then burst in to rooms and say \"mission accomplished\") right as the swim team was jumping off the high dive, as they say. So right as my girlfriend finished icing the cake all over her face my mom was like \"mission accomplished!\"...\n\n\nIt was so awkward, especially since the archbishop is supposed to come over for dinner tonight and my mom's whole book club saw my girlfriend run out of the room naked in embarrassment with the ole DNA squirt squad still on her face, and one thought it was coffee creamer so put some in her latte.\n\n\nI'll never live this down!",

I was super uncomfortable but I had to use the restroom so when I finally picked up the courage to get up I realized my friend was eating hummus with his fingers because we ran out of pita bread. \n\nI had actually forgotten about this until I read this post and I really believe this happened.",

                  "text": "The best sandwich wettener is still pure real butter, imo. I was shocked when I learned that yanks don't use butter in their sandwiches. Pretty much every European country does it. Surely if you can trust Europeans on anything, you can trust us when it comes to food? It makes the sandwich moist and tasty, a sandwich without butter will always taste dry. Plus, the butter acts as a shield against any wet ingredients, because water and fat don't mix, so the butter on your bread stops the ingredients from making the bread soggy, which is especially useful if you're for example making a sandwich to take into work to eat at lunch, so you're probably gonna put them in the fridge, a very wet environment. \n   \nBut hummus is definitely much better than mayo as a sandwich wettener. You're correct there. Hummus is amazing whatever you do with it. Like you can even find dessert hummus, like chocolate flavoured hummus that you dip fruit into like a fondue (except without the super gross \"chocolate\" that you find in any chocolate fondue, because they have to make it 50% oil 50% chocolate to make it liquid enough to flow through the fondue set, but it just makes it taste gross and over oily, so chocolate hummus is a better alternative. \n    \nBut yeah, especially in a sandwich with a hot ingredient, like a bacon sandwich, you haven't ***LIVED*** until you've tried a bacon sandwich with buttered bread, where you melt a big knob of butter a little bit in a mug in the microwave for 20 seconds or so (it may be a different amount of time on your microwave compwrsd to mine, but either way it never takes long to do) to make it spreadable, then spread it on two slices of fresh white bread, presenting itself up to be filled by meat. You take the bacon straight from the frying pan onto one of the slices of bread, then put the other slice on top, cut it in half diagonally (if you cut it into two rectangles, then you aren't allowed to cook food any longer) and eat it immediately so the butter is all warm and dripping over all the bacon like a gorgeous sauce. The juiciest sandwich out there. \n    \nThe butter all melts and it becomes the most delicious sandwich on the planet. You can make it arguably even better, by adding a bit brown sauce to it (like HP sauce for example, that's a brown sauce; apparently the closest yank equivalent is something called A1 sauce, that is mainly supposed to be used on steak!? Which just goes to show you how little yanks know about food if they're putting it on steak). I usually will have two sandwiches, one with just butter and bacon inside the sandwich, and one that has brown sauce in it too as an extra. Because they're both great in different ways. The one without any sauce (except the butter acting as a sauce when it melts) feels just so primal. Its meat and gorgeous fat, dripping off your beard after you take a bite. The texture difference between the soft fresh bread and the crunchy bacon inside just makes if all the more better too \n    \nAlso, fried egg sandwiches. Make it the same way as the bacon sandwich, using fresh butter spread onto white bread slices, and then take the fried eggs straight from the pan to the buttered bread, and eat it immediately. Do not flip the fried eggs over when cooking them, unless it's only for literally 5 seconds or less, no longer. Because what you really want is the runny yolks. Get the bottom of the egg nice and crispy, all that gorgeous maillard effect browning on it, but the yolk is still runny, so again there's that gorgeous texture difference between the eggs and the bread, and also again you're basically eating several kinds of fat all together at once, they drip everywhere, you'll get so messy, but it's so so worth it.\n   \nAlso great is black pudding sandwiches. Again do everything the same, just swap out the ingredient for black pudding slices instead, fry the black pudding slices, transfer them directly to the buttered bread, eat immediately. I used to find the idea of black pudding very off-putting, so I was only like 25 when I first tried one. They're amazing. They taste like Christmas, to me. Like a combination of turkey stuffing, and pork sausage, and bubble & squeak (bubble & squeak is eaten the day after Christmas day, where you take all the leftover veg that nobody ate and are still in the serving bowls (so it was never on anyone's plate), and mash them all up with some potatoes if you haven't got any leftover potatoes already cos everyone ate them, and form it into a giant hash brown that you then fry. It tastes bloody brilliant. Especially because it always has Brussels sprouts in them, which everyone ***THINKS*** they hate because they've only ever had boiled or steamed ones, and cooking sprouts that way is what makes them bitter. If you fry or roast them instead, they're not bitter at all, they're actually sweet, and are similar to potatoes, and the browned up thin outside layer looks like it's burned but the layer is so thin that it doesn't taste that way, so if you roast/bake sprouts, they're ready when they're pretty much brown all over. Well, the reason I've always loved bubble and squeak is that I've always loved Brussels sprouts, but always thought I hated them, and it wasn't until I tried to fry and roast them myself that I realised I've always loved them. Everyone leaves sprouts for the most part at Christmas because they've been cooked wrong and so are bitter, and so bubble and squeak, always being made from leftovers after all, is always made up from a large percentage of brussels sprouts)\n   \nAnyway yeah once you taste a black pudding, you'll realise you were being childish by thinking it was \"gross\". It's no more gross than any other kind of meat product. People will make endless Facebook posts like \"I'm not an omnivore, I'm a CARNIVORE, grrr, give me steak or give me death\". But then they'll look at a black pudding and go \"urgh, blood? From an ANIMAL!? That's very unusual, I'd just like to make that very clear. Blood from an animal? Chance in a million. I don't eat animals, I eat meat\"\n  \nThose are the big ones. Oh and a sausage sandwich of course. Can't forget that. Same as all the others ones, just with sausages on buttered bread with really 100% pure butter (so not any kind of \"spreadable butter\" which is usually only 75% butter and the rest is sunflower oil or whatever, those don't taste anywhere near as good, it doesn't take long to melt butter just enough so that it's still solid, but it's spreadable. Depending on you microwave, you'll have to test it, it may only take 10 seconds in a mug in your microwave, or 15, or 20 secs. Whichever, as long as it's now spreadable but hasn't turned into melted butter). Only thing with a sausage sandwich is that you probably wanna slice the sausages length wise, splitting them each into two. So that one side is flat, the other side is a semi circle. Just makes it less likely that the sausages will roll out of the sandwich when you try to eat it. You could always make 2 sausage sandwiches, if you wanted the same amount of sausage, as opposed to half the amount if you slice each one lengthwise in half.\n  \nOh and roast the sausages, instead of frying them. They always turn out better in the oven, they get really tender and juicy that way, a frying pan isn't a great way to cook them really. Just don't ever prick the sausages before cooking them, because doing that makes all the fat drip out, and the sausages become tough and chewy and dry. You wanna avoid the skin splitting open at all costs. Baking them in the oven does this, it seems to stop them from bursting, maybe because it's a slower method of cooking. \n    \nBut yeah for every sandwich we use butter. Even basic kinds of sandwich, like a chicken club, or BLT. It seems to be just a European thing \n     \nFrance does it, Spain, Italy, the Scandinavian countries, etc. They all love buttered bread. Germans of course have their butterbrot, which is just an open faced sandwich with the bread buttered, and whatever other ingredient put on top. Like for example slices of doctor's sausage, or cheese, or gherkins (pickles), etc. I've really gotta get my hands on a doctor's sausage. They sound incredibly nice. Like, even for people who absolutely HATE communism and never want to go back to it after having lived through it once already, they STILL fondly remember their doctor's sausage. Older folks in former soviet states like to say that they knew the soviet Union was doomed, once they had to change the recipe of doctor's sausage from the classic one to one that swapped in cheaper ingredients to save money. Once that happened, the people knew it was all coming to an end, communism was doomed. \"Genocide, that's fine. Changing the doctor's sausage recipe, how fucking DARE you?\" I've been obsessed with trying to find a doctor's sausage I can buy in my country that uses the original recipe, ever since I watched this video by this chef guy who was born in East Germany (for the kids, Germany used to be two countries, but they merged together in 1990 or so to become one big Germany, and East Germany had been the communist one of the two). He talks to his grandma over Zoom at one point in the video, and the way she describes her childhood and the happiest moments always being when her parents brought home the doctor's sausage and she immediately got to eat a butterbrot with doctor's sausage slices on top, and it's just the sweetest thing watching this really cute old grandma talking about how good it was. [Here's the video](https://youtu.be/AcxQBkdughc)\n    \nSo yeah if you've never tried butter in a sandwich, you haven't lived.",

And do it enough times, and before long you'll have got it banned in every single popular sub and so it won't bother anyone from now on.\n  \nUse a throwaway account if you don't wanna risk your main account. And be inventive and creative with it, use as many slurs as exist in the English language, find a list of all of them and post them here.\n  \nOr you could even dox someone, as that is always the worst thing a user can do, in reddit's eyes. There's nothing they hate more. So get the repeater bot to dox someone, and delete your post once it's repeated it, and maybe you can get the bot banned sitewide instantly, that way.\n  \nBut yeah if everyone just worked together to try and bring this bot down this way, it'd be gone by next week.",

However, the big trick is blending tahini (three tablespoons or so), salt and lemon juice (about half a lemon) for a minute or so FIRST. Add some cold water (two tablespoons or up to half a cup depending on what consistency you want) during this phase. In the end you should have an almost white, firm mixture. This step ensures that the end result is creamy, smooth hummus and not a hard, cement-like mixture.  \n\nThen add the rest of the ingredients (a can of chick peas, some olive oil and whatever spices you want) and blend it again.  \n\nI use no garlic or black pepper since I have that in the tzatziki, but of course you can add any ingredients you like. I prefer cumin, but smoked paprika is also popular, as is sumac.",

Hummus is so good that trash hummus is still better than most things.\n\nBut yeah you've got to try REAL hummus. Freshly made. With a puddle of olive oil floating in top of it. Get yourself to an Arabic restaurant, and get a freshly made bowl of it as a starter, for yourself or to share depending on how big the bowl is.\n  \nAlso, pita bread. I used to think pita bread tasted terrible and had no redeeming qualities to it, because that's true, of supermarket-bought pita bread. Until I went to an Arabic restaurant for the first time, and along with the fresh hummus came freshly baked pita bread, still warm out of the oven. It's the best bread I've ever eaten. It was glorious, it was just for dipping into the hummus. And I could have eaten a bigger bowl of it with lots of freshly baked pita bread as my entire meal, it was that good. Though I am glad I tried the other stuff on the main course part of the menu too, because Arabic food is the bomb, no pun intended.\n  \nSo yeah, stop eating trash hummus, the kind of pre-made processed hummus that's weeks old and is sitting under lights in a fridge in the supermarket. It's fucking amazing, mind you. But as far as hummus goes, it's trash hummus. It doesn't even have the big puddle of oil floating on top of it, a necessary feature of good hummus. I suppose you could just add your own.\n  \nBut yeah, instead go find as many Arabic restaurants as you can, and order real freshly made hummus with freshly baked pita bread. And then once you know what food hummus tastes like, you can start making it yourself at home. It's really easy to make.\n   \nAlso with the olive oil, use only the best stuff, the one that's got the same name as my high-school nickname, \"Extra Virgin\"",

Now there is more calories and hopefully a bit of fat and protein to give the body what it craves. \n\nI mean, it\u2019s delicious, I get awesome chipotle black bean hummus* from the farmers market. But I consider the like Safeway  hummus or whatever a very utilitarian food item. \n\n*still made from chickpeas, it just has black beans ground up in there too. Real good. Not authentic.

My friend whipped a little eraser at me and struck me dead in the eye...a hard one, it was shaped like a little pumpkin. I was screaming bloody murder...she kept wanting to help. \n\n\"Let me see\"\n\n\"No! Get off me....oh my God, it hurts\"\n\n\"I'm sorry\"\n\n\"Owwwwwwwww....it hurrrrrttttssss.

There would normally be about 5-8 teens hanging out regularly. \n\nThe guys found out you could get a bag of free condoms just going to the sexual health clinic and asking general questions. So they all went multiple times and we had so many that we filled a coke case with them. We would blow them up, rub them on our hair and put them on the ceiling as targets. Then toss lit cigarette butts at them to pop them. I know so classy. \n\nFor some reason, my bf's step mom thought he and his best friend were secretly gay because they would share the same bed after drinking. She would say these backhanded things all the time. So one day they get into a fight and she yells at him while we are all there saying, \"AND I HOPE THOSE CONDOMS ARE BEING USED FOR SEX! STRAIGHT SEX!!!\" We all just busted out laughing and dying because yes they were being used a lot.",

That just makes it all the more hilarious.\n\nIm done replying now. The type of unhinged grown ass man that stalks peoples profiles and belittles them for every human action they do isnt the type you can argue with. Stalk me harder daddy\n\nEdit: actually to retouch on your last points. Stay in my weight class? Im 6ft. 201lbs as of today, did manual labour for 3 years and weight lifting for 2. If you knew what a gym was youd know muscle weighs more than fat. Im sure you saw my post saying \"my recruiter told me stop lifting weights and just start running\" while touching yourself to my post history so theres really no excuse for that kinda oversight from a masters graduate.\n\nAs for the tattoo you called shitty, youre talking about the one i called shitty 20 something days ago, asking how to cover or fix it, correct? Thats like calling an overweight person at the gym fat.\n\n\nEdit: im a highschool graduate planning to start college, not a college graduate. Thats a mistake on my part, kinda like when youre typing something then start thinking of something else and you accidentally type that instead.",

If that was  a comment on reddit and I don't know the person, then I would assume the commenter was a woman unless otherwise specified. This is why TIFU posts where they don't specify the gender can get confusing, especially when it turns out they were not your typical hetero relationship. Yes, perhaps in OP's post the word gay was not necessary, but does it really matter? Why make such a big deal out of such a small thing?",

I wouldn't have noticed honestly if it wasn't being discussed. But I think its kind of ridiculous to be like holy shit I don't know if the sex was gay or not unless specified. People don't often hear about the intimate activities of entities of unknown gender. And if they do, it's generally not useful *to* know.",

In a gay threesome, the dudes will often form a gay sex circle by putting their peepee in poopoo hole in front of them if their peepees are long enough, all the way around in a circle. Generally, with gay sex, the more peepees the better. \n\nWith regular sex or mostly regular sex, the proportion of peepees to vaginers is how gay it is, rounding down to the nearest half. So one peepee and one Coochie = half gay, but you round down so it\u2019s zero gay. Two peepees and one coochie hole = 67% gay rounded down to half gay.

Similarly, if I said her husband was there also, and we had gay anal sex, then you\u2019d know that not only did he watch me have the butt sex and mouth sex with the lady, but that we also had gay sex with one another.

By saying \"gay sex\" and labeling it you are othering it and saying it is not normal.\n\nEdit because I guess this is a hot take: we are not talking about porn or identities here. Yes labeling things in porn and people applying labels to themselves can add clarity. We are talking about labeling it as \"gay sex\" in natural conversation with 2 actors of known genders. It would be just as awkward if the son's friend was a girl and OP said she thought they were having \"straight sex.\" \n\nA similar situation would be 2 people getting married. A man and a woman gets wed and so they were \"married.\" Two men get wed and suddenly they got \"gay married.\" When an action is quantified like that it is used to show how it is different from the norm. This is othering, plain and simple.",

Would sex with a girl imply a very different story than sex with a guy? Not really. So what's the point of adding the detail? If I was telling a story about how I bumped into someone at the store, I don't say \"this Asian guy hit me with his cart\" I say \"this guy hit me with his cart\" unless the fact that he's Asian matters to the story.

Obviously if it's getting to a dangerous or unhealthy level, the parent should step in, so I'm not advocating for any extreme  but I think a mostly laissez faire approach will set up the kid for a healthier life later on - so that should be the default approach. Care should be taken and attention should still be paid.\n\nI just feel like it's a crucial point in a teenager's development where they need to create an independent identity outside of the confines of their family unit. They need to act out against the parent, they need to do \"risky\" things in a controlled way. It's a natural part of growing up and should not be regulated. In fact, sex should be discouraged in a faux way in order to allow that rebelling in a way that isn't dangerous.",

WE ALL ALREADY KNOW ITS GAY SEX. You don\u2019t have to keep telling us *every single time you say it*. \n\nBecause not only is it obvious that the sex would have been \u201cgay sex\u201d because that\u2019s\u2026what happens when two men have sex or two women have sex, BUT -\n\nHere\u2019s the kicker: *your story would have been identical if all genders had been left out.*\n\nSo why was it so important you had to put \u201cgay sex\u201d in the title?\n\nWhy didn\u2019t you specify anyone else\u2019s sexuality in your story?\n\nWhy didn\u2019t you make sure we knew you and your husband are straight? (You\u2019d probably say \u201cbecause it\u2019s obvious y\u2019all are straight due to you both being married with a child.\u201d I\u2019d counter with \u201c*it\u2019s obvious when two dudes fuck each other that they are likely having \u201cgay sex.\u201d \n\nGayness to you is obviously something you have a lot of hang ups surrounding and I hope you work through them.)\n\nThink about what I said and why you felt the need to specify only this one detail of your story in the title of the post. Every single mention of \u201cgay sex\u201d could be changed to \u201csex\u201d and your story would have been identical.\n\nSo why did you feel the need to include it?",

You're just that good, bravo\n\nFunny you say this but that's exactly what you're doing to OP. They have said multiple times that they have no problem with gay people and yet you seem to know them better than they do. I understand subtle malicious intent towards LGBTQ+ exists and it's quite common but to go so far as to start an argument when there's no real indication that OP is homophobic and has confirmed they're not is ridiculous.\n\nInstead of creating a large rant about them being homophobic when they're not, instead just put \"Hey, the use of the term 'gay sex' opposed to just 'sex' can be seen as homophobic to some, I know that you might not mean it to be but thought I'd mention it\" and leave it there.",

Not asked him 2 hours after his friend left and demand him to prove he wasn't having sex..

Anyway, he\u2019s been experimenting with sourdough bread and has been getting pretty amazing at it. He\u2019ll often give some loaves to the parents of his students. He goes to tutor one of his clients and gives a loaf of sourdough to the parents. So he\u2019s tutoring this kid, and every once in a while, he\u2019ll hear moans coming from the living room upstairs. He doesn\u2019t make anything of it and continues teaching. Then after a couple of moans, out of nowhere, the mother calls out \u201cWE\u2019RE NOT HAVING SEX UP HERE. YOUR BREAD IS JUST REALLY GOOD.\u201d My brother was like okayyyyy. I told him that she said that cuz now it\u2019s the perfect cover if the parents want to bang one out.",

The in the middle I take a bowl and dice onions, red bell pepper, olive-- kinda whatever fun stuff you have around, cauliflower, carrots, cucumbers, etc. Sometimes i add cheese (heavy cheddar, feta, provolone, whatever). Put that mix in the center area of spinach and fold! just mind you it gets BULKY! Can be hard to wrap w too much stuff. I've enjoyed plenty of them where it's falling apart at the seems but OH MAN is it delicious every time!\n\nI'm gonna make one now lol",
