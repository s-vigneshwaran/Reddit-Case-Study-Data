When she got to the resort half the staff had abandoned their posts, there was an outdoor buffet just left to rot in the sun, serious post-apocalyptic vibes.  She got on the first plane back out and noped out to Florida for the rest of her vacation, and the first of the Hugo Chavez coup attempts happened just afterward.",

Human capital was their strongest capital from the beginning. \n\nStuff like gas, coal, etc. (which would make subjugating them interesting) only became important later down the line, but at this point the country's culture had already \"settled\" + it was on its way to attain independence.",

It is a nasty fusion of feudalism and Roman Law in which there are only two classes, the very rich, who own and control everything; and the peon peasants.\n\nTheir wealthy cannot enjoy their wealth unless surrounded by grinding poverty, prosperity among the peons stripping their caviar and Champagne of its flavor.  In turn, this makes the peons lust for radical egalitarian leftism -- they want to see the heads of the rich on poles.\n\nWhy are the giant economic meetings (G7, whatever) typically held in high rises in big cities, at the base of which are thick cordons of police to beat back the protesters?  They once held their cabal meeting in a luxurious castle in the countryside, no protesters showed up, and they *hated* it because there was no live entertainment of police beating peasants.\n\nHowever, as soon as a peon gets a lot of wealth and power, they instantly adopt the philosophy of the wealthy pseudo nobility, and despise their former peon peers.\n\nMost of those who live in Common Law countries utterly reject Old Europe Disease.  The few that embrace it still imagine themselves as pseudo nobility who want to lord it over everyone else.  If you think about it for a little bit, the names of these billionaires come to mind.\n\nThe US is based on Common Law, and its culture is just as pervasive as that of Roman Law.  Compare Bill Gates, who has created hundreds of billionaires, multi-millionaires and millionaires, and it doesn't bother him one bit; to Carlos Slim of Mexico.\n\nSlim controls one of about a dozen families that control the wealth of Mexico.  The top people that work for him are all from his family, and the second tier, outsiders, work at only a fraction of the wages.  Even a top manager doesn't really make a fortune, because he is just a *vassal* to the lord.\n\nOld Europe Disease in a nutshell.",

                          "text": "My argument was that the different [formative legal systems](https://i.imgur.com/TTrYaer.png) for both Old Europe and Spain *resulted* in a cultural evolution for both.  \n\nTo flesh it out a bit, Roman Law was written by the upper classes not for themselves, but to control the lower classes.  It had ideas such as, \"If an action is not codified as legal, it is inherently illegal\", and when brought into court, guilt was assumed unless innocence had been proven.  There was a prosecutor, but no defending counsel for a long time, and when there were, they could not object to what the prosecutor was asserting.\n\nThe wealthy, on the other hand, were under the control of the crown, who could whimsically reward or punish them as they saw fit.  The evolution of Roman Law was first into Napoleonic Law, and then to the French Civil Code.  \n\nOutside of the Roman Empire, the tribes had a warrior equality system, that is, warriors were all equal, and as a great novelty, at trial, which was overheard by a powerful chief, who acted as a neutral arbiter, and they would be tried by other warriors, in \"a jury of their peers\".  And there were advocates both to accuse and defend.  Unless an action was clearly against the law, it was legal.  (Which turned out to be a boon for innovation.)\n\nThis migrated to Britain and evolved into Common Law, which permeates their culture.  Innocence until proven guilty, right to a jury trial, equality of all at birth (eventually).  No royalty.\n\nA great example of the intellectual distance between the two is found in the simple, brief constitution of the US, which is oriented more to *limiting* the power of government; to the hopelessly complex and bloated phone book which is the European constitution, that seriously tries to codify all of human behavior.  It is a bloody, inoperable mess trying to justify a ruling class of faceless bureaucrats lording it over ignorant masses.",

Several criminals were released, including that criminal ex-president.However, he still couldn't participate in the elections, as he was a criminal.\n\nBut, conveniently, a \"technicality\" found by a supreme court minister (that was indicated by him, mind you), his charges were dropped, and the process would need to start all over again -- ignoring hundreds of convictions made by several dozen career judges.And that made him eligible again.\n\nThe current president has strong popular support, moving millions of people wherever he goes, while the \"ex-criminal\" cannot even think about going outside, with the serious risk of being lynched by the populace.However media reports and polls says he'll straight win, with no runoff elections.Same thing said 4 years ago, against the current president, which supposedly \"had absolutely no chance of winning\".\n\nThe current president also tried to push for a better, more transparent election system.Currently, we use a first generation electronic voting system. You put the candidate number on an electronic urn, it displays the candidate, you press confirm, it beeps and it's done. The votes are, then, sent over the internet to a central counting system, which is supposedly inaccessible to everybody but the operators, at the end of the election period (the urns are not connected to anything other than power during the elections)\n\nThe main issue with this system is that the votes can't be audited. What the system puts out must be trusted, which would make it vulnerable to hidden code and manipulated hardware, displaying a candidate on the screen, but registering another in the memory.The current president wanted to add a printed vote system, where you would type in your candidate number, it would display the candidate on the screen, then would print the candidate on a paper, which would then drop in an urn after confirmation. That way, you could audit the system by comparing the results with the physical urn.\n\nSounds logical, right?\n\nBut the same Supreme Court minister, who found the \"technicality\" that freed the \"ex-convict\", also is the president of the electoral court. And he said that \"this system isn't necessary because the urns are absolutely secure\", and dropped this project (which was en course since 2014, was supposed to go in action in 2018, but was postponed to 2022, which then was ultimately discarded.)",

Not  saying brasil is perfect, the corruption is ita biggest problem imo.  Crom is mainly due to lack of opportunities, tied to the current economic state of inability to find jobs that pat a lovable wage for moat if the unskilled labors.  Take care of the economy and some of the crime problems wouldalso be solved.  Now the fevals are another story, that's been from decades of neglect though.  That's far more complicated.",

A lot of US companies would have opted with BR over China manufacturing since they're closer geographically, but the rampant corruption of officials soured a ton of deals and we're left with what it is today.\n\nHell, you ask any financial analyst even today and they'll say BR is capable of becoming an economic powerhouse with the right leadership.

Also, the temperature isn\u2019t good for agriculture since there isn\u2019t a winter to kill off pests, and so there isn\u2019t much coordination among farmers.\n\nThat would all be difficult enough, but South America has ALWAYS been breathlessly corrupt.  South American countries aren\u2019t like the settler states of the U.S, Canada, Australia or New Zealand.  Their colonial structure was different and incorporated slavery on a scale that would make the U.S south salivate, and they had a caste system that India would envy.  The same people who benefitted from the system were the people who overthrew the Spanish to form the various states.  Bolivar was wealthy, and became a dictator.  Brazil was a monarchy, and Argentina/Chile came close as well.\n\nBefore the Americans had the ability to project any real influence in the area, corruption was wide spread and deeply entrenched.  The CIA and KGB only altered who was in power, not what the people in power did.\n\nSouth America as a whole was always going to be doomed due to geography, and the corruption only made things even worse.  The only country that isn\u2019t cursed by geography on the continent is Argentina, but there the corruption and mismanagement is only getting worse to the point where I suspect the people are voting in whoever promises to be the most corrupt.\n\n\nFYI:  Any politician who runs on an \u201canti-corruption\u201d platform is probably more corrupt than the last guy, if not equally as corrupt.  They only run on that platform when they aren\u2019t in power and do it because it\u2019s an easy way to get voted in and gives them the ability to jail political opponents (usually their predecessor) without public backlash.",

But the people supported them because they weren't collaborators. blah. Some things you say are correct, but you keep adding lies that don't make sense in the midst of it. Where do you get your history from?\n\nNorth korea was able to sweep down the peninsula because they were better equipped, better trained, had more soldiers and blitzed South Korea.\n\nAnd yes, there was a lot of violence in South Korea in the beginning, due to? Communist sympthatizers supported by North Korea.\n\nYou keep adding your own twists and lies to everything.\n\nAnyways, if I had to live somewhere I rather live in south korea then China or north korea :]",
