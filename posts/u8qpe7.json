  "text": "TIFU by thinking my son was eating hummus when he was actually having gay sex [UPDATE]\nSo yeah, the majority of you were right, they were having sex (I did think it sounded like it). They ate some hummus first, then put it away (didn't do anything at the same time like some of you freaks suggested) and then had sex. My son's boyfriend (I think they're boyfriends) saw the post and couldn't stop laughing, so told my son (thinking it could be about them) who told me because I think he felt a bit guilty about hiding it.\n\nOther than that, nothing really exciting happened. We had a long awkward talk, I told him I don't really endorse him having sex but he should really use a condom etc.\n\nNow onto the more important thing, hummus. I really like hummus now, I'd never had it before because it just looked kinda disgusting (yellow and sludgy) but I have learnt appearances can be deceiving. It was homemade so I'm going to have to ask for the recipe so I can make some more (I've finished all of it)\nAlso what are some other good things to dip in it? I've tried the obvious things (carrot, cucumber, breads) and any suggestions would be appreciated. \nA lot of people have recommended Baba Ganoush as well? Is that similar or better than Hummus?\n\n\nTLDR: My son is actually gay, but also I really like hummus",

I was in situations where parents were straight in denial of their kid (either hearing or not. Who knows but I know I wasn't always the most subtle as an edgy kid). Other times parents weren't homophobic and didn't matter.\n\nI've seen both sides of the coin. I'm in my 30s and not planning on having more than fur children with my fiance.

                              "text": "I'm divorced. My x and children moved 4 hrs away. At holidays, in this instance Christmas, my x and I would take my kids on a holiday shopping spree. I never wrapped a single gift. This year,  my daughters wanted Victoria Secret items, so we go there. This year my youngest daughter's boyfriend tagged along. Yup dad and bf headed to VS with their mother and them and the shopping starts. We leave, it's just better for everyone this way. Now, my x is pretty hot still. She's a conniving rag but nonetheless a milf by all standards. The lad and I walked for a long while and we decide that they MUST be nearing the end of that experience, right? When we get there, it's obvious there's still work to be done. My x was dressed to the nines, most notably in a low cut shirt. I can only assume that in the maternal spirit of helping the very same daughters she's trying to compete against, she is being overly helpful. She is out-working the store clerks as my kids are in the dressing room. As the game plays out, I'm a kid in a candy store with a rock-solid alibi for being there empty handed, the lad is in the most peculiar situation seeing that all of this is for him and we all know it. My daughters are \"daddy this, daddy that\" and it's generally weird watching my Helpy Helperton x flit about the place in an attempt to melt her credit card. Strange. In the midst of it all, the size of bra my daughter desperately needs in the style she desperately wants is stocked in these drawers on the floor. My x is putting on quite the show and her blouse is so loose and flowy, I can't help but to notice and remember them fondly. I could see the top of her belt as i look past her breasts, past the top of her head. There was nothing left to the imagination. I realize I am daydreaming/fantasizing and suddly come to. I shake it off, jolt myself back into Xmas shopping and realize the lad is doing the same thing. He's not yet caught himself. Eyes wide, mouth agape. I am standing beside him and he feels my stare. He realizes it, looks at me and that look, it was priceless. He's about to speak to break the awkward tension of my still fixed gaze and one cheek smirk when I say to him \"you like that? I used to hit that you know...\" His face melted.",

I\u2019m a year younger than him so cut to my 18th birthday (we dated for 3 years before this)- we are magically home alone, our hormones are in control and we think all of the doors are locked. Our clothes are on the floor, leading to my room and we are getting busy, things are loud. We\u2019ve been waiting for a while. Condoms are strange things that we don\u2019t entirely understand. Halfway into it, I hear my grandmother\u2019s voice calling me. She\u2019s almost at the stairs. I have never gotten dressed so quickly in my life. I\u2019m wearing his pants. I grab a new shirt and it\u2019s on the wrong way. My hair is a mess. My face is red and I\u2019m out of breath, but I beat her to the stairs, go downstairs and greet her and her boyfriend (probably not smelling the best). Unbeknownst to me\u2026 my boyfriend is upstairs trying to get rid of the condom. Flushes it. It comes back. Wraps it in toilet paper and throws it the bin. It soaks through and you can see it. Wraps it in more toilet paper and tosses it into the neighbours yard. I\u2019m offering to make my grandmother some tea when, in road runner fashion, my boyfriend comes flying down the stairs, in my pj pants, and out the door, my grandma turns grey, and her boyfriend gets red and goes after him, saying he\u2019s gonna go check if everything is okay. Behind me is a really big window\u2026 right underneath the bathroom window.. where the wrapped condom had been tossed out and had gotten caught on the neighbours\u2019 fence, and in slow motion, had unwrapped itself, with my grandma and her boyfriend seeing the entire thing and my grandma also saw how my boyfriend grabbed it and tossed it over the wall just as her boyfriend came into sight in the window who got the more up close shot of my boyfriend trying to get rid of the evidence of what we just did. \n\nSo, there was only one thing to do. I made tea and we pretended that nothing happened. We later on went to change our clothes before my mom got home and yes, grandma did tell my mom. My mom is amazing and waited for me to go and tell her before we talked about it.",

Then he asked \"and you\" to the girl I had been crushing on for three years and finally was hooking up with.  She said same.  Then he went down stairs and we continued with a little laughter and kissing and discussion about how he was cool and chill.\n\nOne of my brothers was interrupting another time and being a complete ass throwing chips at us and running away laughing.  Then ratted me out to mom that was a fun one.  She was legit pissed for about a month.  Didn't care later when the two of us lived together for a year though.  Idk why she didnt like that gf.  \n\nOnly caught one of my brothers once and his goth girl was in a weird bdsm outfit that made me nope right the fuck out and pray he didnt notice my out of it ass stumbling in late that night.   That one got me to be a lot more careful about potentially interrupting.   Also cut mom and dad off once but meh I was too young to know what was what then lol.",

I knew that my kids were breaking the rules.  I also knew that if I confronted them on it, I would lose.  Losing did not mean I would not get my way, losing could also mean I got my way but at the cost of the love of my children. So sometimes I would clamp down and sometimes I would pretend to not know.  I know it is a bit hypocritical but if I let on that I knew, I had to do something about it and not openly condone their behaviour.  \nBeing a parent is the hardest job I have ever had.  Grandparent is much easier, not my job to draw difficult lines, teach life lessons or prepare for life,  just ignore and love.  Not good parenting but way easier. much more fun.\n\nEdit: someone down below.  \"plausible deniability\" game.",

Pour the sesame seeds into a food processor and turn it on. Pulverize them to your heart\u2019s content. \n\n2. Slowly add olive oil while the food processor is running until you get a paste. The sesame seeds should stop jumping and the mixture should turn smooth and semi-liquid. \n\n3. Turn off the food processor. Add 1/4 cup lemon juice, 3 additional tablespoons of olive oil, 2 tablespoons of water (I use the water from the chickpea can myself because I\u2019m classy.)\n\n4. Run the food processor until you have a nice, smooth liquid. \n\n5. Turn off the food processor. Add drained chickpeas, garlic, salt, and cumin. Then run the food processor again. You might need to scrape the sides a couple times and rerun to make it smooth. \n\n6. Pour your hummus into a serving bowl. Use a spoon or spatula to make a well in the middle. Fill with olive oil and garnish the solid part with a dusting of paprika. \n\n\nIf you want to make flavored hummus, grab a bell pepper (roasted,) extra garlic, a handful of olives, 2-3 jalape\u00f1os, or whatever else you want in there. Add about 75% to the food processor (Step 5) and replace the olive oil in the well with the other 25% (Step 6.) For example, throw 3 walls of a roasted red pepper into the mixer and chop up the 4th wall to throw in the well. \n\nEnjoy!",

Open and drain the can of chickpeas, peel as many of the chickpea skins as you have time for, the more you peel the better the texture will be but don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t have the time. \n2. Peel off long strips of lemon peel for the topping and then cut and squeeze the lemon into a blender and add the tahini to the blender. Blend for 15 seconds to whip air into the tahini. It should go from a liquid to thick and fluffy.\n3. Add the olive oil and the garlic and blend for another 15 seconds until combined.\n4. Add half the chickpeas and blend for 15 seconds, if there are still whole chickpeas that haven\u2019t been blended scrape down the sides and keep blending, repeat with the second half of the chickpeas.\n5. The texture should look quite dry at this point so add the water and blend till you like the texture, add the cumin and salt and blend to combine. \n6. Add to a bowl and score the top with a fork to alow the olive oil in the topping to evenly cover the top\n\nTopping\n1. Cut the garlic cloves into slices and add with the lemon peel to a frying pan with olive oil and fry with constant stiring for 1-2 mins on low heat just so that the lemon peel curls up and the garlic starts to brown. \n2. Take the pan off the heat and allow the oil to cool for a couple of minutes and then pour the oil, garlic and lemon peel on top,",

One which no bias or lack thereof can escape. There's historical context. It leaves it up to the person hearing the term to decide how they ultimately feel about the subject if anything at all. Also sometimes it's very important for the person using the modifying term to practice saying it as a form of coming to terms with their own predisposed bias and there willingness to let go of said bias. So while the hearing or reading of the words may have caused you some sort of reaction bordering on a judgment against the narrator you failed to consider exactly what they might be going through in favor of your own petty desire to have everybody automatically feel the way you do about the subject. I mean this with no ill will it's just always beneficial to consider the other person and their feelings in a an abstract manner then your own. That's where true understanding lies.",

I know the shared pain and how deep it goes.  But realistically the idea of homosexual sex and relationships in the public domain is still finding its footing and while people are more understanding and tolerant now than say 30 years ago it will obviously take another 30 years of improvement to be hopefully at a point where no one does need to say \"gay\" as a modifying term. However I think it's silly to deny how much different the conversation is around gay seconds and relationships compared to hetero_norm sex which for the longest time didn't need a modifying term either. No one would dare talk about any other kind of sex in public. \n\nI think it's important to step back and say it's okay to be uncomfortable when talking about such things. And if someone else's uncomfortability is going to have a similar affect on a gay person I feel like it's up to the gay community to hold head high and practice an air or passivity as everyone comes around. If we deny that gay sex makes some people uncomfortable than we are practicing some degree of intolerance ourselves.  It's okay that it makes some people uncomfortable. They have a right to feel that way too.",

And props to you for your love of hummus. :) \n\nSecond, a little of advice I hope you find helpfily: since your son is gay and sexuality active, make sure his PCP is gay friendly and then ask about getting your son on PrEP as soon as possible. It prevents HIV infection by around 99.87%. It's simple to use (it's a pill a day) and if you go with the generic drug it should be covered under insurance at 100%. If it isn't Gilead has a copay card for the name brand. It will also cover him at 100%. Why is PrEP important? Because sometimes as a horny teen you can't find a condom. Boyfriends lie about their HIV status. Etc. Etc. Etc.  \n\nFull disclosure: PrEP requires lab work every 3 months to check liver enzyme levels. Most people handle it fine. \n\nSecond I'd look at getting your son vaccinated for HPV. It should be covered by insurance if he's under the age of (25?). It will help prevent throat and other cancers. \n\nHope this information helps. I wish we'd had these options when I was younger! Good luck! :)",

      "text": "I was living with my best friend's family after moving back to my home state a year or so after my family had moved away. I was 18 or 19. His older sister had moved out and they let me have her room. I had never been caught at any point in my young life at the time, but his mom had recently walked into his room when the neighbor girl who I had introduced him to was on her knees. Luckily his back was against the door and nothing was seen, but it was definitely known. So naturally my girlfriend and I had had been making fun of them mercilessly for weeks. Now for context, himself and both of his parents worked at walmart at the time. They were managers and he was in the back processing and sending out returns to manufacturers or whatever, I forget the term by now, claims maybe? Regardless, all of them worked Sundays. Myself and my girlfriend however worked at Chili's and Starbucks respectively and happened to have Sundays off. So while she would spend the night on and off throughout the week, she definitely always spent the night on Saturdays, and we layed up in bed relaxing until they had all gone to work when we could get it on without worrying about being overheard or walked in on, before going to the late afternoon service at our church. Until one morning when we went about our Sunday routine and my buddy's dad had a much later shift than usual, unbeknownst to us. My friend's dad left to run errands before work around the time he usually left for work, and we got down to business. He came home to change for his shift, and decided to come show us something or tell us something or whatever. Luckily he came in after we had finished warming up with 69 and because that would have been a sight to see. At the moment in question, she was on top, and I had just enough time to throw the sheet over top of her when I heard my bedroom door. He didn't see anything and noped the fuck out as he and I both apologized simultaneously, and we never spoke of it again. He did however leave for his shift, and tell his son as soon as he got there. I know this because my friend within a half hour of the incident sent me a spongebob meme and nothing else. The face spongebob makes when he realizes that squidward likes krabby patties. You know the one. I replied with one word, \"Motherfucker.\" And all of a sudden the teasing went both ways.",
