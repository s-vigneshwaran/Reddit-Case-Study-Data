The sad thing is that some of these people could have been saved if someone had done something to help treat their mental health issues earlier, and if they actually had a team of trained mental health professional to help keep them stabilized. If we can't get Republicans to vote for gun reform, then we have to at least try to get them to vote for mental health care improvements.

That communities were just quietly hiding them.\n\nYou'd also have to discredit the claims by criminologists that the way we publicize shooters by making sure the entire nation sees their face, learns their name, and hears their manifesto drives a lot of shootings by inspiring sad, desperate, suicidal people to \"go out in a blaze of glory.\"\n\nThey've been saying this since the 90s, and the media chooses the money they get from covering shootings over doing the right thing every time. Meanwhile, some nations have codified that they will not publicize mass murderers to limit how much notoriety they get.\n\nCriminologists recommend largely omitting the killers from the stories and focusing entirely on victim impact coverage, community response, and humanization. \n\nShow the world the people who were taken from the community. Do not show the world a killer and tell the audience all about their manifesto. The former will make someone think twice about taking a life. The latter sends the message to desperate people that mass murder will allow them to \"make a statement\" or \"leave their mark.\"",

Some states are better than others about allowing mail-in voting or having early voting, especially since the pandemic, but those are primarily blue states already. This mainly disadvantages the poorest voters because they can\u2019t afford to take a whole day off of work to stand in an 8 hour line, and a lot of the poorest voters would stand to benefit the most from left-leaning policies.\n\nThere\u2019s also the problem of [gerrymandering](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering). Our electoral process is set up so that not everyone\u2019s vote counts the same. It\u2019s very easy for left-leaning voters in red states to feel like their vote doesn\u2019t matter, and vice versa. Plus, compared to most if not all other western countries, the two biggest parties we have to choose from are on the right side of the political spectrum. Sure we could vote third party, but without a massive organized movement most of them wouldn\u2019t get elected and it would just further split the vote and we could end up with the worst of the choices in charge. And again, the people who would most benefit from a movement like that don\u2019t have the time to organize it, because at best most of them are living paycheck-to-paycheck.\n\nWith all of these factors it could seem especially pointless if they would also have to take unpaid time off to go cast that vote. Of course this isn\u2019t the case for everyone who doesn\u2019t vote, but it\u2019s a not-insignificant portion of non-voters. \n\nAnd to add to the other commenter\u2019s point about our education, when Bush was in office he implemented what was called the No Child Left Behind policy, which essentially prioritized grades and tests over actual knowledge. I was just starting school when he got elected so I experienced this first hand, and I was born and raised in a blue state. I didn\u2019t learn critical thinking skills until college, which not everybody has the resources to attend. \n\nI will grant you this, a lot of us here who are progressives have also given up on most of the regressives ever waking up and learning to think for themselves. But when you look at the results of the popular vote in national elections, the regressives who are dragging us down are the minority (at least of the people who vote), it\u2019s just that the places most of them live have heavier weighted votes.\n\nEdit to add: I want to clarify that I do vote in every election. I\u2019m just offering some perspective on why that might not be possible for everyone here.",

Nothing made the national news cycle until May 14th when they had the white supremacist angle to spin.\n\nThere have been 11 mass shootings in Chicago so far this year. No one gives a shit.  It never makes national news. Of course those guns aren't legally owned.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCalifornia which has some of the strictest gun laws in the Nation have had over 20 shootings this year.  Again a lot of gang shootings in which the guns are certainly not legal. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll these instances make local news.  But to make it the national stage they need more of an angle. School shootings , white supremist (never other race supremacists) or like When the Cali law to ban 18-20 year olds from buying semi automatics was ruled unconstitutional.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLets face it. At the end of the day  there are millions of gun owners who go about their day to day using guns to legally provide food for their family , to reduce animal populations that can result in saved lives , or use them recreationally at ranges.   \n\nIt's similar to cars. There are people who own cars and obey the law every day all of their lives. But then there are people who end up killing others with cars be it drunk driving ,racing , not paying attention the road ,  road head ,  in proper militance and so on and so forth. But there are never calls for removing cars \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn 2021 there were 20,920 homicide/murder/unnational\n\n2020 there were 19,515\n\n2019 there were 15,490\n\n2018 ,  14,916 \n\n2017 , 15,733\n\n2016, 15,128\n\n2015, 13,571\n\n2014 , 12,358\n\nThat is out of 320-350 million people.  Remember also that is both legally and illegally owned guns.",

An 18 year old male would easily over power smaller children ,  a knife doesn't make sounds so you'd only be alerted to screaming. But if a person entered a classroom of say 2nd graders with a knife he /she could kill multiple people before anyone knew what was going on. The screams that weren't  with gun shots might be ignored as just kids acting out.  It's not fun to think about  but it is a possibility.   Another possibility is multiple knives with some being thrown.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is no reason to remove guns from law abiding citizens.  If you want to have the conversation about better funding for police to break up gang violence and removing illegal guns from circulation. I will 100% support that . If you want to better fund police to respond to credible threats of gun volience  then I a 100% support that.  But I've owned guns for almost 20 years and I have never used one illegally.  I have a gun safe that is bolted into the floor behind a locked closet door that is fire rated . They are only removed when I go hunting or  I go to the shooting range.   They have never taken another humans  life. They have consistently put food on my families table and by culling the deer population they have save the lives of deer and of motorists who die in  deer accidents due to over population. \n\nThere are 10s of millions of people who use the weapons responsibly that would be punished by laws that wont actually fix anything.  California who has some of the toughest laws on the books  still had over 20 mass shootings so far this year.  The majority of those shootings are illegally owned guns and stricter gun laws wont do anything to people already breaking gun laws",

If he went into a primary school it would have been far worse. \n\nYou are naive if you think mass stabbings on the scale of this shooting couldn't happen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nExplain why California one of the toughest states on gun laws has had roughly 25 mass shootings in the first 5 months of 2022  if gun laws work ?\n\nIf you want to reduce gun violence then you  increase programs to remove illegal guns.  Everyone is out raged about this school shooting and it sucks that little kids are dead.  But there are gun shootings every day in the united states used with illegal guns that shouldn't be in circulation. If we actually funded the cops and gun buy back programs you'd remove the illegal guns from this country and reduce gun crime even more. \n\nThe answer for when someone doesn't something wrong isn't to punish people who aren't doing the wrong thing.   There is violent crime on the NYC subways every day.  Should we close the subway ?  I mean its simple right , take away the subway and suddenly those crimes don't exist anymore.

There is no way to know how many were legally purchased guns.\n\nOut of 350 million people that is a fraction of a percent.  Out of all the legal gun owners that is a fraction of a percent of people who miss use guns.\n\nTrying to limit a person who is abiding by the law  wont stop illegal gun violence either\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat should be done is better funding for removing illegal guns from the country. Better police funding to break up gangs.  Better police funding to follow up leads  like the Buffalo shooter who was posting on social media and telling people in his school that he was going to shoot up people.",

There is always a reason, and it's usually because the kid is an outcast and has had to deal with bullies their entire lives. So they find solace in the forums on the deepweb, which in turn convinces them to fight back in horrific ways, including murder. Anyone who has bullied or made fun of the weird kid is responsible for this gun violence. You can try and take the guns away, sure, but it won't even begin to solve the underlying issues. We are failing our children. They don't feel safe or loved at all. So they retaliate in horrific ways. Go read some of the manifestos of these muderers. They all read eerily similar. We need to end bullying completely and reform our mental health system if we have any hope for real lasting change.",

Namely the social safety net issue is for sure the primary reason this is happening (and your analysis is pretty spot on as far as how poor ws groups recruit in person). Higher education is certainly a contributor but I'm more startled by the existence of school boards on a local level as Republicans have used that since the dawn of time to politicize the curriculums of our base education. Thats why we have to unlearn all that shit in college (If you're lucky). Because the internet has changed the radicalization game by decentralizing the influence and creating personable \"centrists\" who (un)knowingly disseminate the rhetoric, it makes it more palatable. And since the disenfranchisement of people is happening on a very large scale across the US, the extremists have realized they no longer need a face, just the sentiment packaged in a way that sounds emotionally agreeable to the downtrodden.\n\nI hate to say it but I think a large amount of the change needs to be cultural and digital. Misinformation has always been an issue but the weaponization of it through the internet needs to end",

Israel requires its citizens to undergo military training at 18, which includes learning how to operate a firearm.

The mandatory military service would also help. It would help give young angry isolated individuals, a purpose, an identity within a structure of discipline and a place to grow and belong.",

The US was considered woke back in the day, and also slavery was legal and women could not vote.\n\nThere are tons of things that can be done to fix it. But the systems in place are very hard to change and the people who are benefiting from them do not want them to change. But change is inevitable, so we slide closer to Fascism instead of towards direct democracy. \n\nGetting involved, contacting representatives, helping people register to vote, and following local state and federal government are all great steps everyone can take, unless it causes you to lose your fucking mind. Then you just need to rest until you\u2019re ready to go again.",

It doesn't matter if it's 4 or 25 or 50. People are dying.\n\nThe cause isn't guns. It's just not. If you think guns are the problem you're just stupid. Guns are tools. We need to identify why people commit these crimes to begin with, and then go from there to solve it. \n\nFurthermore, if you look at gun death stats vs other death stats they pale in comparison. Like. It's okay if we allow the subjugation and starvation of kids around the world, but God forbid the gun deaths. \n\nThe truth is that with each tragedy that happens our government takes more power away from us under the guise of protecting us from ourselves. The media frenzie that happens is ridiculous because they don't care about deaths, they care about getting views because it makes them money. The more controversy the better.\n\nAbolishing guns or restricting guns will not solve any problems. It just won't. Take a look at the war on drugs for all the proof you need.  \n\nFinally, just because a tiny **fraction** of people use guns as a means to commit crimes, doesn't mean we should restrict the rights of the many responsible owners. With the ability to defend ourselves, we are citizens. Without the ability to defend ourselves we are subjects.",

They have to deflect this or risk looking bad.\n\nThat is incorrect by a long shot.  I agree with you that most extremist shooters are white, but in your statement you do not refer to extremists mass shootings.  \n\nWant to know how bad of a problem this really is and want to know what real injustice looks like?  Last year there were 636 mass shootings in total, not just the 42 that meet the redefinition in your reply.  Did you know that out of 636 mass shootings 64% of them have no suspects?  When was the last time you heard about a mass shooting that the police had no idea who did it?  Probably not often or never, yet last year it\u2019s well over the majority of them.  The victims all seem to share similar characteristics and no one seems to care much about it.  You want an example of systemic racism playing out in real time, you have one.\n\nThese are all tragedies, they need to be stopped, and we need to do more to stop them by enacting better gun control and adding psychological evaluations and cracking down on the market of stolen and illegal guns. This horror needs to stop, even if the event is not politically useful.  Did you hear about the hate crime that happened on 5/17 where 3 Asian women were gunned down just because they were Asian?  Probably not.  \n\nhttps://mass-shootings.info",

Maybe even try to limit access to the black market for guns. \n\nThis just makes guns regulated in the same manner as medical marijuana or vehicles. Yet would be very effective on preventing insanity from breaking loose, unlike giving hormonal teenagers weapons while at school. \n\nBut just even reducing the size of magazines would be enough to cause a second insurrection, this time with actual gunfire and bloodshed.\n\nSo we're fucked",

All you need is a medical examination, registering to a shooting range to get basic safety training, and speaking with your local police department about getting the specific licence you want.\n\nYou can get a hunting licence (allowing you to have an unlimited number of hunting rifles - this includes AR15s - and up to 250 rounds / materials to make up to 250 rounds on your own if you know how to do it), a sporting licence (up to 12 guns), a collecting licence (also 12 guns, but I think it can be expanded), or a self-defense licence (allows conceal carry, but you must prove that you have a need for it).  \nWe don't have open carry. Magazine size is limited to 20. We use .223 and 9x21 instead of 5.56 and 9x19 parabellum.\n\nWe never had a school shooting since 1861. Criminals kill each other using illegal guns most of the time. Legal guns are used mostly for suicides, or by the usual old guy who can't stand seeing his wife slowly die on a wheelchair and decides it's best that both die on their own terms, or sometimes (every case is one too much) by guys who can't stand the end of a relationship - and by the way those are usually deeply troubled individuals. The only \"mass shooting\" we had that I can remember was in 2018 when Luca Traini tried to kill some immigrants in retaliation for a rape that had happened some time before. He shot 6 people but did not kill anyone, and the gun had been illegally obtained.\n\nOn the other hand, I think we seriously undervalue mental health, and in the US it's even worse. A fucked up guy can buy an illegal gun everywhere. Finding proper help when you're depressed or suicidal is much harder. I think that's where the solution lies. That, and possibly better education and culture.",

I went to the restroom, on the way back I check my phone and see a notification from Next Door about a shelter in place near my neighborhood, I click in and breath a sigh of relief because the first comment was that there were shots fired outside/in the area of another school.\n\nOut of curiosity I pull up Google maps to see where it is, and it's like 1 mile from my kids school.\n\nWent to Facebook, turns out the shots fired \"outside\" this other school were fired *inside* our school.\n\nI didn't hear from the school or any authorities for hours.  Everything was word of mouth.  I drive a Jeep so I drove through a construction zone to get past the first layer of closed street and get closer to the school.\n\nI talked to an officer outside the school, he said all the kids had been moved offsite.  He didn't know where.  He gets on the radio, they are at another school.  I Jump in the Jeep and haul ass over.  When I get there parents are running out of the area, I yell out to one as I'm running in... she says the kids aren't there. They are at a local church.\n\nHaul ass to the church, same thing, no kids.\n\nHear they are at a rec center, Haul ass over there and that's where they are *going* to be, but are on busses so the police can make sure none of them is an accomplice or something.\n\nSpent hours crammed into the rec center auditorium waiting for ANY news about our kids.  Thankfully they were OK, they released by grades so my wife took our 2nd grader soon as she was escorted inside.  I waited another 1.5 hours for our 7th grader, keep in mind... NOBODY KNEW IF THEIR KID WAS OK even by this point.  Like, you didn't know if you were going to see your kid come through the doors or if their entire class was going to pile in and you're left standing there knowing your whole world just changed.  Everytime the officers made an announcement for \"the parents of...\" to come to the front, everyone's heart broke.\n\nIt was like Schrodingers children, they were both dead and alive until the box opened and they walked in.\n\nThrow in the fact that I was a military volunteer at the OKC bombing who spent time digging through rubble for survivors and only finding dead children and broken toys, and my own PTSD was through the roof.\n\nNews like what broke today, means I may not make it into work the rest of the week.  I don't know if my kids will finish out the year, they have two days left.  Life has changed forever.",

I worked across the street from the STEM school shooting in Highlands Ranch. By complete chance, I was working from home that day, but I live less than 10 minutes away door to door. Was on a call with coworkers when they interrupted me saying they had to get away from the windows, move to one side of the building, they were in lock down and something happened at the school. No one was allowed to leave.\n\nWithin 5 minutes I received reverse notification from police/County/whoever that there was an incident. 5 minutes later another notification from the daycare my daughter attended within 2 minute walk from the STEM school was on lock down and NO ONE (not even parents) were allowed to pick up students, absolutely no exceptions allowed, and they would not let anyone in the building other than law enforcement. \n\nAt this time I called my husband nonstop who was working downtown because we had a close family friend/his coworker whose son went to the school, they immediately left. Another 10 minutes later we recieved texts from the school district that every school within the area was in lock down and no one would be dismissed. By this time, our family friends started recieving notification on the incident from the STEM school her son attended, and where to go to meet. \n\nWithin 30 minutes of first being notified, cell service was limited in the area and texts were difficult to get out. Even though our two children weren't AT the STEM school, it still took 1.5-2 hours before we could even pick them up. Eventually when the all clear was given for pickup ID was required, mandatory pickup by guardian only, for daycare and our daughter at the non-STEM school.\n\nOur community was \"lucky\", the sheriff's department is literally a 2 minute drive from the STEM school (just at the end of the street), so response was super fast. And one of the Children's hospitals with emergency care happens to be 2-3 minutes away, if that. It could've been much worse.\n\nI feel for any parent that has had a kid at a school with a shooting, I was terrified and mine were safe. I had coworkers working in the office the day of the incident with kids at the STEM school, I can't imagine what they went through watching everything, not being allowed to leave. They eventually moved away from the area. I think everything reminded them of it. School, work, it was just too much. I always think of them and our friends on days like these, it's still hard for them.",

As a requirement to obtain a license, you must be able to demonstrate you know how to handle the firearm efficiently and safely and have an approved gun safe for storage. The police do check, periodically, that your storage is adequate and the firearms in your position are licensed in your name.\n\nYou are required to give a valid reason for owning any type of firearm. Valid reasons are; your are a member of a sports shooting, or target shooting club, you are a primary producer, you have permission from the owner of rural land, to shoot on their property.\n\nHome defense, or self defense are not valid reasons for owning a firearm in Australia.\n\nFarmers can own rifles for farming related tasks. Nobody else needs or wants guns. There is no demand. There is no gun culture. It is not part of everyday life. It is not something people think about at all.  Gun ownership has to be applied for through legal channels, and you have to be approved by the authorities and all guns have to be registered to owner.

Some semi-autos are allowed but they are limited to five round mags. Pistols are ok up to 12 (or something) rounds but can *only* be shot at a range and must be under lock and key *and* inoperable at all other times.\n\nYou of course need to be licensed for all different classifications of gun. You can't just go all willy nilly buying shit. \n\nThe sentiment here is much the same. We get some spill over gun nuts who are detached from reality but by and large guns are not a thing unless you're a farmer or in polar bear country or into hunting and sports shooting. Nothing wrong with that. Outside of that context they're...not even something worth discussing.\n\nThere was a mass shooting here a few years back. I think there are still inquires going on. Some more guns got banned despite not being relevant to the incident. Ultimately that shooting was a situation in which the *rules and regulations worked* but the authorities shit the bed across the board (the guns were illegally smuggled in from the US and not caught, the police were notified that something was up with the guy and did nothing, when the shooting started there was mass confusion).",

But the process for amending the constitution means it's *much* less likely to be able to pull off in the USA, especially for something as popular as gun ownership. And that's not exactly a partisan thing: there are a LOT of Democratic and/or liberal 2nd amendment supporters out there. \n\nBeing a constitutional right limits the kinds of laws that can be passed, and there isn't nearly enough bipartisan support to make it stop being a right. I'm not saying that there's not a gun problem, but it ultimately boils down to *Americans want their guns.* Call it a problem with American culture if you'd like, but then the question is...how the hell do you fix culture? If we have to make Americans *want* to give up their gun rights in order to make certain anti-gun laws constitutional in the first place, then how do we do *that?*\n\nThis issue is far too complex to fix it with a solution that's as easy as \"just change the laws.\"",

This is because most domestic terror shootings have been done by males radicalized into incel or racist ideology, all which fall squarely into extreme right ideology.

Can you please tell your Republican friends that just saying we need easier access to mental health services isn\u2019t enough? Like maybe they should actually vote for that? Because the only people actually trying to make that happen are democrats. So that alone would be great. Call your favorite republican congressman doesn\u2019t matter which one and please ask them to just make that happen. Because it\u2019s not. And it\u2019s not because of the democrats I\u2019ll tell you that. \n\nTo answer your second question I\u2019ll start with no person to person gun sales. If you want your gun sold you have to go through a background check on the person you\u2019re selling it to and it has to be recorded. Any gun sold without a thorough background check that is used in a murder results in charges and jail time. \n\nNo guns for anyone that puts up violent shit on social media. This asshole who killed those kids was doing that but in Texas you can\u2019t stop him from having a gun. \n\nAnd I\u2019m going to go deeper here. No difference between a conceal carry or an open carry or having a gun at all. Every person who buys a gun needs to have a license and have gone through proper training to own it. One license and you can conceal or whatever the fuck you want. But in order to have a gun at all a license will be required. And not just any license. I want a through comprehensive course where people are actually taught how to safely own their weapon. Can\u2019t pass that can\u2019t have a gun. \n\nThat\u2019s just off the top of my head.",

Mass shootings like this one are, factually, rare in the scheme of things, with most mass shootings going unnoticed. \n\nYou may think this is our second one since Buffalo. Its actually our 17th. \n\nA ban would decline suicides, but all that does without addressing mental health is force the people suffering to kick the can down the road to a point where even the lack of a gun isn't going to stop them taking their own life. \n\nAnd the majority of mass shootings just are not the same thing as Uvalde or Buffalo, which is why you most likely weren't aware of most of the other 17 mass shootings we've had between those two, because the media does know the distinction and reports accordingly. The number of dead has to be around 7 at a minimum to go national. \n\nAnd this is a problem because regardless of how you feel about guns, the dishonest reporting is fostering dishonest opinions on guns. People think the issue is more severe than it is, but then others think it is less common than it actually is, and some believe both. \n\nThats a lot of the reason why the topic stalls out everytime because no one wants to be honest about the problem.",

The majority of the land is red, but **land** doesnt vote, **people** do. You can win the presidential election with only 13 counties. If counties/districts were in flat regular squares based only on population or if we had tiered voting, no one with an R in front of their name would ever be elected. But instead the country is held hostage by the dumbest people alive voting for the worst people alive. \n\nIts literally the meme where the kid is show two cups, one is poured into a tall thin cup and thinks that one now has more water in it now.",

How many white suburban kids got locked up for drugs? The laws that a lot of people want, \u201ctotal ban, very few legal circumstances,\u201d sound a fuck ton similar to bullshit drug laws that are obviously racist. \n\n Gun laws are inherently racists.

Republicans allowed the ban to expire in 2004 when they were in the majority. \n\nDemocrats introduce antigun bills. Republicans block these bills -- as well as the outlier \"democrat\" who is extremely conservative, like Joe Manchin. \n\nMitch McConnell has blocked everything at every turn. Republicans packed conservatives onto the Supreme Court. The list goes on. \n\n**Republicans control the Senate right now.** There are 50 Republicans in the Senate, only 48 Democrats. (And 2 Independents.) Republicans block *everything* the Dems pass from the House of Representatives onto the Senate. Nothing gets done without **final** approval of the Senate. The House of Representatives (which is the only Dem majority) does not have final say. The Senate (Republican majority) does. **They are two separate entities.** \n\nIt's the last stop (sort of). \n\n**House of Reps ---> Senate ----> President** \n\nGet a red majority at any three of those junctions-- that's how bills in favor of gun control, abortion rights, gay marriage, and trans rights die. The bill could pass through a blue majority of the House and a blue majority of the Senate, then die on the desk of a republican president who vetoes it. \n\nBut in our current situation, the Senate's Republican majority is always there to vote it down. How do you fix that in this current situation? Vote Republican senators *out* of the senate. Nothing, I mean *nothing*, is done without Senate approval. The Dem majority in the House of Reps can propose bills until the sun goes down, but they must ask permission of the Republican majority in the senate at the end of the day. And more often than not, the answer is a big fat **no**. \n\nDemocrats do what they can, but Republicans still have the final say with those 50 senators sitting high and mighty in Washington. This is how bills are passed and blocked. \n\nLook it up. It's the Republican Senate majority every single time. \n\n[Not enough Americans vote, largely by choice.](https://www.npr.org/2020/12/15/945031391/poll-despite-record-turnout-80-million-americans-didnt-vote-heres-why) \n\nThe 18-34 age group is the most notorious nonvoter group, too. \n\nIf those *80 million* nonvoters regularly showed up to every state poll, we would have more progressive action. \n\nAmericans upset by election results need to motivate and educate nonvoters. \n\nCheck social media. Facebook. Twitter. Instagram. Your state's subreddit. A lot of the candidates just use those platforms. \n\nAlso: \n\nhttps://www.vote411.org/ \n\nhttps://www.usa.gov/election-office \n\nhttps://ballotpedia.org/Sample_Ballot_Lookup \n\nGo here too: https://www.usa.gov/states-and-territories -- select your state, scroll down, select \"election office\".",

Over the past few years there have been a ton of instances of people driving cars into groups of people killing many. Based on your logic we should be calling for cars to be banned and more highly regulated.\n\nThese are tools that SICK people are using to hurt others. Banning a gun isn't going to stop someone who wants to kill people from killing people and the very idea that it will is just the doest thing I've ever heard.\n\nFurthermore, all the shit I listed off is very much a big part of the issue.

What YOU seem to be blithely ignoring is the simple fact that it's a lot easier for \"crazy people\" to commit mass murder IF THERE ARE GUNS EVERYWHERE. People without guns can kill people, also nobody is denying this. But it's delusion to pretend that easy civilian access to guns don't drastically alter the equation.",

For example, the bolt-action Lee-Enfield, a British design from the 1910s, was used as the standard-issue rifle for Britain\u2019s soldiers up until the 1950s. It served the British well, and after the war it was sold in large quantities to the civilian market, where it was revered as a reliable and inexpensive hunting rifle. Was the Lee-Enfield designed to hunt deer? No. It was designed to kill multiple people in a short amount of time, and it did so well when it was called to do so during war. But it still functions remarkably well as a sporting or hunting rifle. In Canada, these 110+ year old rifles are still found in almost every old man\u2019s basement, and I can guarantee none of them have been used by a person to kill another human being since the 1940s.",

Parents were afraid to send their children to school.\n\nThe community eventually underwent a period of reform. More volunteer work was encouraged, after-school community programs were established, and community-wide cleanups and development projects were enacted. Crime rates began to decline, and as far as I know today they are still that way. Guns weren\u2019t touched by any legal hand, and considering the evidence and the outcome it was pretty clear the problem was bored teens and YA who had nothing to do and no sense of community or self-worth.\n\nA person with low self-worth and nothing to do is a pretty likely candidate for a mass shooter. Access to a gun is only one part of that equation, which would be regulated by previously discussed background and mental health checks, and proper safety courses.",

They want to spread as much fear as possible to make as much money as possible.  \n\nThe hate and fear filled rhetoric fills the conservative listeners full of fear and they go out and buy guns before the big bad libs take them away or the brown people replace them or whatever the flavor of the month is (I'm serious go to a store that sells ammunition the day after a Democrat wins the presidential election and just watch people).  Which makes the gun companies and NRA more money.  Then one of them goes nuts and kills a room full of people cause of fear over minorities like in Buffalo or just a general psychotic break like today.  Then liberals start to buy more guns to protect themselves out of fear of these public shooters. Which makes the gun companies more money.  Then conservatives afraid that their guns will get taken away go buy even more guns, which makes gun companies and the NRA more money!\n\nThe NRA and gun companies WANT as much violence and death as possible BECAUSE IT MAKES THEM MORE MONEY!  it's literally all they care about. \n\nAnd our republican senators are bought and paid for. Even though 92% of the American people support Universal background checks for firearm purchases, and there has been legislation on this sitting in the senate for the past 2 years, these republican senators won't even vote on it cause FUCK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.\n\nGo out and vote.  Vote for progressive candidates that aren't backed by the NRA so we can get the common sense gun laws 92% of us want.  Vote against gerrymandering so we get a government that is representative of the American people, instead of what we have today.  Vote against voter suppression so your vote will actually be counted.  Vote like your life or the lives of your children depends on in BECAUSE IT FUCKING DOES!",
