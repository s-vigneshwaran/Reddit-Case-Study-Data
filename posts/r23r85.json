Really appears that masses don't understand, there are fucked up individuals across the plane of societies trend of labelism.  Out there sounding like Cereal Killer from the movie Hackers. \"We have no names.\"   Really some pathetic pleb like shit if ya rhink about it. \n\n>No one is surprised. Defending yourself against white people attacking you is somehow an act of white supremacy, now.\n\nIts amusing if you think on how much power dumb coonts give words. Fucktwats need to take a lesson from Patrick Swayze Roadhouse.\n\n* OMG, they called me a racist!\n* Well, are you one? \n\nSeriously, if the spaghetti coonts want to plays stupid games. Say ya resort to Tales from the Hood. \n\n* We want the shit. \n* Oh you'll get the shit. \n* You're going to be knee deep in the shit. \n\nInstead of attacking that individual, we just blow up the entire planet. That'll solve everyones fuck baggory. Or how the memes say, modern problems, modern solutions. lol",

Infection rates were high even among African American women who had few lifetime sexual partners. The infection rate for African Americans who had only one or two sexual partners during their lifetime was 29.7 percent, compared to 12.9 percent for all other racial groups with one or two lifetime partners. The researchers also found that only 7.8 percent of African Americans infected with HSV-2 had been previously diagnosed, compared to 23.4 percent of whites.\n\n>dodge bullet like Neo from the Matrix",
