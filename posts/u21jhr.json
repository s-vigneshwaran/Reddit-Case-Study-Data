Gleichschaltung attempted to force \r\nthe German people to conform to Nazi ideology. As a result of Gleichschaltung the \r\nDeutsche Christens (German Christians) diminished the importance of the Old \r\nTestament, rejected the biblical Jesus, and propagated proper Nazi gender roles. This \r\nthesis will argue that Deutsche Christen movement became the driving force of Nazi \r\nideology within the Protestant Church and quickly dissented from orthodox Christian \r\ntheology becoming heretical. The Deutsche Christen heresy was unique to Germany and \r\ncould have only been formed within the borders and historical context of the German \r\nnation. This heresy created a division within the established Protestant Church. As the \r\ndivision grew the heretics and the orthodox members struggled for power. This struggle \r\nbetween orthodox German Protestants and the Deutsche Christens, known as the \r\nKirchenkampf (church struggle), resulted in the orthodox Christians forming the \r\nConfessing Church. Subsequently, the Confessing Church insured that the Protestant \r\nchurch, as an institution, rejected the Nazi\u2019s attempt to force the German citizens to \r\ncomply their ideologies.",

              "text": "Another huge misconception about religion is that it's a monolith. For some it's not about imposing beliefs at all.\n\nI feel that I have an example of how we are supposed to live. An example for how to love one another and treat one another. I'm supposed to be respectful to people and forgiving of the things I think they've done wrong. I'm supposed to try not to be angry with people. I'm supposed to help people. In short, I'm supposed to make the world a better place. Jesus didn't force his help on people, he offered and showed basic respect for people. His helped build people up.\n\nIf my attempt at assistance is unwelcome, then it's not helpful. If I try to show love to someone, but they can't see it as love, then it's not love. If you go around asking people if they want ice cream, then hitting them over the head, they aren't going to build a very positive association with ice cream. Ice cream can be the greatest thing ever, but now something ugly has been made a part of it.\n\nA thing of debate within Christianity is the role of the Law of Moses in Christianity. The Bible basically says that we were given this perfect Law, but when people used it they just did evil with it. Jesus was God taking the Law away from us so we couldn't keep using it to do evil.\n\nI don't think God has a particular problem with people who are gay. I voted for marriage equality in my state before the Supreme Court made it moot. I believe that abortion is morally wrong, but I'm pro-choice. If my state puts a measure to make abortion a right in my state, I'll vote for it without a second thought. I believe in sex education, access to contraception, and better healthcare and social support for women and children. If men and women knew more about sex and reproduction and had access to contraception, there would be fewer unwanted pregnancies.\n\nI don't believe these things in spite of my Christian faith, I believe them because of my Christian faith.\n\nPeople blame religion because bad people gain power in religious organizations and use that power to hurt other people. If you wiped out all religion, the bad people would still be there and would just seek power elsewhere. If religion had never existed, something like the crusades would still have happened, it just wouldn't have been religiously motivated.\n\nEven though religion itself isn't the problem, there is no doubt that many Christians have sinned and continue to do so against other people across the world and across history. This means that we have lost much of what moral authority we could have claimed. It also means people will be justifiably angry with us a lot. We have a lot to make up for and a lot of shutting up to do.\n\nI understand the anger. As a Christian who used to not be a Christian, I guess I just see that the problem is bad people with too much power. If God isn't real, then religion is just a social construct, just like government, charities, and book clubs. Atheism is an expression of moral belief and the source of moral authority. There are many atheists who are good people and some that are very bad and want to use their concept of morality to control other people. No social construct is immune to bad people. The problem is bad people.\n\nAnyway, sorry about the rant.",

Did I disagree? Yes. Did I agree? Also yes. I made the point that I'm a religious person who has no interest in imposing my religion on you. I want you to be completely free to make your own choices.\n\nIn the Bible, Christianity is described as being a light on a hill. You can block your view of the light, if you want, just like you can go choose to block your view of a neighbor who has painted their house a color you don't like. If everyone is free, then the merits of the light can become clear. Where I agree with you is the wrongness of some Christians to approach your metaphorical house and shine flashlights in through your window. I also agree with the evilness of those who bring torches, to shine a light and burn down the house, so that you can't ignore the light. That's what the assault on Roe v. Wade means to me. A bunch of people with torches.\n\nI like to hear what atheists say and think because your point of view is valid. If I think you are partially wrong about one thing, it doesn't mean your entire perspective is invalid. I think it's worth it to listen to you. When a bunch of people are roaming around with torches, it's hard to know what light comes from where. And when people are roaming around with torches, no one is safe. You are very much a part of that conversation.\n\nI don't think echo chambers are a good idea. I think it's important to hear differing perspectives.

Some of it was purposefully memorized, with points for accuracy. Much later, after one of the exile and return periods, it was compiled into the Torah. It was around this time that they were encountering Greeks and other people. The story of Noah and the ark probably wasn't about a real person, or it was about a person who just saved some animals in his boat. Lots of cultures in the area had flood stories, so there probably was a period of intense, world-altering flooding going on. I don't think the story of Adam and Eve is literally true. \n\nThis doesn't do much for the, \"God wrote the Bible and we've had it forever,\" crowd. Of course, there was a council that met to assemble the official new testament from what they liked from the various letters and stories about Jesus. In the 1950s some theologians decided that gay people (who weren't me tioned in the Bible) were more of a problem than pedophiles (who were specifically called out numerous times and referred to as an abomination), so they did a little swap.\n\nAnother thing to remember about the old testament is that it's fucked up because it's really fucking old. Imagine if 14 million people maintained an active, modern religion centered around the worship of the Greek pantheon. Judaism is older than Hinduism and Buddhism. Everything was fucked up back then. It comes from a world that is totally alien to our own. If ancient Greek religion was still active today, their book would be fucked up too.",

The question isn't whether or not he existed, the proper question is whether or not he did the things the Bible says he did.\n\nPerspective does matter. Kings and Chronicles cover many of the same events, but one was written by a Solomon fanboy and the other written by a more neutral source. The whole idea of the Bible being a literal source of truth became a thing when Christians freaked out about people not believing the Bible during the start of the scientific revolution.\n\nGetting back to my delicious piece of cake, the Bible isn't literally true. Something doesn't have to be literally true to be true. I can say that someone stomped on my foot and turned it into a pancake - they didn't magically transform my foot into a piece of food, they stomped it really hard.\n\nYour perspective is that God doesn't exist, and that's fine. If He does exist, He didn't make it easy to prove it. Mine is that the generally Judeo-Christian God does exist. I have evidence that is good enough for me. The Bible is there to teach us, but not always in a straightforward way. There's been a massive push to include the Bible side by side with scientific and historical texts. In a scientific text, it can make a statement of fact about a kind of rock and it is what it is (or it should be). The Bible isn't like that and should not be considered literal in any way. If it happens to have something that is literally true, great, but that's not the point.\n\nThis is the great divide between Atheists and Christians. The point isn't whether or not God exists. The point is that some people (some of whom believe in God and some of whom I think are just pretending) are using religion as a pretext for controlling women's bodies in an evil way. All this debate about whether religion is good or bad creates a conflict that has nothing to do with what's actually going on. People may take the wrong side because they feel the need to stick with their team, which is not something that is unique to religion.",

There are some concerns that Christians later modified the text to add some flavor, but most generally agree that the basic mention of Jesus is genuine. He's referred to as the brother of James and there is a reference to his crucifixion. \n\nTacitus wrote about the crucifixion of Jesus and referenced him as the reason his followers took on the name \"Christian.\" Despite the face that some scholars don't believe the authenticity of the passages (they agree that Tacitus wrote them, but they don't think the references are reliable), they are generally held as reliable.\n\nThese two sources are considered non-biased.\n\nIn reference to the question about 'He' versus 'he' when talking about God, in Christian tradition, references to God are sometimes capitalized, even when using pronouns. Not always, though. I find it helpful to capitalize for clarity, since sometimes there be something about God talking to some guy, then He said, \"blah blah blah,\" to him. It makes it easier to figure out who the pronouns are referencing.",

Some of that may be the result of later interference by Christians, but some of it is when he is brought up in the context of Christianity. There was an established group of Christians in Rome, at this point, who had made a name for themselves by refusing to worship the emperor, doing charitable acts that no one else was willing to do, and generally making a nuisance of themselves.\n\nBoth Josephus and Tacitus wouldn't have considered Jesus to be anything other than a normal man. They probably considered Christianity to be an interesting curiosity, more than anything else, worthy of a brief mention, but not much else. They gospels seem to have written over the course of the century after Jesus' death. Josephus and Tacitus wrote their stuff around 100 AD. A little after 300 AD, Christianity was the official state religion of the Roman empire.",

However, I think we can have and share these morals & ethics without a religion. Bc that in itself created a situational process in society as well . It has people feeling forced, not understood. If I\u2019m being honest, I am more of a Christ person, than most Christian\u2019s themselves. We should teach people what being a good person is rather than force them to follow a belief to tell you what a good person is. That\u2019s where things get taken out of context. I am also pro choice bc it goes against my realistic nature for I am a realists, but morally I do have heart & I think it is always wrong yet justified . I\u2019ve not heard not too many real Christian\u2019s out here and I can say you are far more closer than most to what Christ would say/do itself .",

Local churches handled local welfare, essentially. Even the church building's upkeep was often handled by donated labor. It was only when churches started to fail in these community obligations that the modern American and European welfare systems were able to become law. \n\nMy personal recommendation? As a Christian myself? Require that all 501c3 (or equivalent) organizations file an annual budgetary return detailing total income, costs for ordained ministers or priests only (lay preachers should be considered a volunteer position), and community outreach and poor fund spending. When compared to the expected tax for a local company of equal size, it should just about measure up. If not, then tax the remainder from them.",

Even if you're pro choice (which I believe most of us are here) you likely don't view abortions as \"good\", as in no one is getting pregnant just to have an abortion. Evangelicals view it as murder. This is the common ground we have with them. The difference is that they want to make it illegal (I believe someone in this very chain described it as forced birth which is a good description).\n\nI used to have a link to a study (it's on my desktop) that showed that a state (in the Midwest or West, I don't recall which) that allowed teenage girls you get contraceptives for free and without parental consent not only had a decrease in teen pregnancy but a decrease in teen abortion.\n\nPeople don't respond to logic. They certainly don't respond to being told they're wrong. I really do believe that the best path forward is to have a heart to heart with them and try to have them agree that the risk of promiscuity is the lesser evil compared to murdering babies.\n\nAnd worst case, if abortion does end up being illegal (I hope not) but we do manage to get them to see the importance in free contraceptives then at least we got that.",

Wade provided a clear standard for abortion access.  1st trimester, all the interest is for the woman and states cannot restrict abortion access.  Second trimester, there are shared interests, so some restrictions can be put in place, but it can't be outright banned.  Third trimester, the interest lies with the state and they can therefore ban all abortions except in cases where the woman's life is in danger or the fetus is unviable.\n\nThis clear and easy standard (considering the subject) was kind of gutted with the ruling in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, where you got the more ambiguous \"undue burden\" argument.\n\nIt's really simple.  Return to the Roe standard.  You're right that there's too many extremists to agree to something sensible because the anti-choice, pro-forced-birth fanatics won't stop until we're in the handmaid's tale.",

I totally disagree. \n\nBy numbers, there are way more women, minorities, LGBTQ people and people who aren't those things but support equal rights than there are people who are offended by the concept of equal rights, so you're alienating way more people by going \"ugh, the problem is caring about rights of oppressed groups\" than you would be by agreeing equal rights is important. The people offended by equal rights are a small minority so it's ridiculous to cater everything to them when that alienates the majority of people. \n\nIf you're offended by equal rights that's your prerogative, nobody can stop you, but you need to understand that attitude will mean no women, minorities, LGBTQ people, or people who support the equal rights of those groups will be on your side. So you're never going to have enough people to get anything done, unless you want to flip over to the conservative side. It's not a viable strategy.",

Men of all ages are overwhelmingly more likely to be anti-choice; men are also overwhelmingly more likely to be in an elected position, thereby enabling them to impose their collective will on women. Women may make up 51% of the population, but we are outnumbered by more than 2 to 1 in Congress and state legislatures. On any issue, you will find some people eager to vote against their own interests, but in this case men are actually responsible for the drafting and passage of these anti-choice laws.

The claim was \"no form of prohibition of anything anywhere has ever worked\" not \"No form of prohibition has ever solved more problems than it created\". Sure there's other problems. The incidence of the prohibited thing still went down, which was the point of restricting it, so it works.\n\n>In the case of abortion, look at the countries where abortion restrictions are much tighter than in the US.

Duh, black-market abortions\n\nUnless you want to claim that everyone that wanted to get an abortion before is now getting black-market abortions, this is also a different discussion. Look at the number of abortions before and after it was restricted/prohibited and you'll see that the number went down. It works.",

It was just something that your naive little self didn\u2019t think of.  Which is why you have yet to name a single example as to when prohibition of anything, anywhere, has not only failed to stamp out a single vice, but created more harm than there was originally. \n\nAlcohol? All that did was create bootleggers and enable Al Capone.  Prostitution? The natural and probable result is sex/child trafficking.  Dope?  Filled up the jails?  Yet, people use just as much as they ever have and now we have a fentanyl problem that is killing people left and right.  But in each instance, prohibition failed to stamp out the \u201cevil\u201d it was supposed to.\n\nSo, congratulate yourself on what a \u201csuccess\u201d your brilliant proposal to ban abortions is, and watch the body count grow yet ever higher",

Conservatives will rail against socialized medicine because it puts your life in the hands of government officials that decides who is worth saving and who is not (death panels) but this is exactly what they want to do with pregnant women.\n\nAnd all this doesn't even bring up the most obvious issue that women have bodily autonomy.",

A potential for a human is not a human. \n\nThe moment it comes out of the womb and starts breathing on its own its human. Until then its a fetus.\nMurder is defined by clinical death and the violence that goes with it. If we defined it by life then murder cases would become much more complicated.\nBecause life is a loose term that runs into sand pile paradoxes, especially when discerning at which point a cell becomes a living being.\nAt which point does a group of sand grains become a sand pile? You can add arbitrary definitions like \"a single sand grain is the beginning of a pile\", or \"3 grains are a group - therefore a pile\" but its still arbitrary, especially if you are counting how many sand piles a sea urchin makes during its lifetime.\n\nEqually funny is the statement that I murdered someone if I expelled a clump of cells from my body.\n\nThis doesn't mean I would easily murder you just because you can't prove to me a immaterial soul, which your statement implied because of you emotional connection to the topic.",

Are you seriously making the argument that a clump of cells starts breathing and poof becomes human? It\u2019s ironic how you criticize me for basing my argument on what defines life as only working with with the societal convention that life begins with a clump of cells having a soul and then define life based on a different societal convention. How is defining life as birth followed by breathing any better than the beginning of a unique sequence of human DNA? We don\u2019t need to delve into an ontological argument on how many cells make a person, one or more cells makes a person and death is simply the destruction of all those cells. While it is convenient for death to be clinically diagnosed when the heart stops beating and the lungs stop pumping that is only the case because those are necessary operations for the continued existence of those clump of cells that we classify as a person. I fail to see any definition of personhood barring this that doesn\u2019t allow for morally dubious actions in living people. When you start chocking are you dead because you can\u2019t breathe, if your heart stops and you race to call attention to yourself before you pass out are you no longer a person?  If you\u2019re in a comma incapable of thought are you no longer a person? No, because even the clinical definition of death requires these states to be irreversible and a baby prior to birth is not forever incapable of those things. It is not inflammatory to compare abortion to murder if you draw the line of personhood at any point apart from birth because doing anything else would be illogical.\n\nAlso I\u2019m an atheist, the presumption that any argument rejecting the morality of abortion up until the point of birth is impossible barring religion is ridiculous. Without god we must still find morals somewhere and acknowledging personhood at some specific point is necessary for any system of morals, we still have to make that decision and rejecting any definition other than birth because you believe they require a soul is a dangerous proposition.",

This is a biological definition. A fetus starts being a baby when it can survive independent of the mothers physiology.   \nIts not a social construct. Its a physical change that turns a biological machine, a clump of cells into an autonomous clump of cells.  \n\n\nMany cells in your body dont have the same DNA, many animals have unique DNA and bacteria/viruses develop new unique DNA every second, DNA that can be even inserted into other 'living' beings and make their DNA unique once more. You dont hold killing bacteria as murder.  \n\n\nAnd my initial claim wasnt aimed at you but at the people who start and propagate this message: the Church. It has all the elements of their MO anyways. The emotionally hyped arguments that have no foundation in reality and pointless polemics to make something thats normal distorted and considered grave and serious.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe argument is simple.  \nAbortion is not murder, murder would be causing the death of a human. Causing the death of a fetus is not murder, they are human when they are disconnected from the mother. If you can cut the child out of the mother and it survives this then its a child, if not, its a fetus. Its still part of the mother. Its a extension of the mothers body unless it can function without it. Up till it gains autonomy, the mother decides as if its a benign tumor growing on her shoulder.  \n\n\nWe can talk about the morality of abortions, but not equate it to murder because these are different things for the reasons mentioned above. We can talk about the potential of a human, but not about humans, because these are fetuses.  \nThis is not a euphemism to blunt my moral relativism, its just that we are talking about different things that have different definitions and can be equated for many reasons.  \n\n\nThe simplest example of this is the fact that we dont hold funerals for fertilized zygotes that didn't hold to the womb wall. Why? Because its different.",

You yourself have unique DNAs throughout your body, and you will continue to develop such cells until you die. Animals of all sorts have different DNAs, unique ones. Bacteria and viruses have too, they develop new sequences each day, hour even, and even have the ability to modify other DNA sequences of human and non-human animals. Yet we dont put a premium on it. Not to mention that DNA is not the only factor, there is methylation and folding done that determines expression and this happens after conception. Its also a sand pile paradox. Yet autonomy of bio functions is clear cut. You might argue incubators, but this is an attempt to save a child that would have functionality without a disease or malformation, or an attempt to save it. While if we developed a tech that allowed outer-body maturation of fetuses, the fetus would still not be a child until it was released from this machine.\n\nWe dont need to delve into ontological arguments to see what makes a person - then you continue to ontologically define what a person is. So you basically just wanted to assert your definition without a debate is what you're telling me? Ok, kidding aside.A person or not is irrelevant. We are talking about baby-fetus distinctions. A person is complex and even a baby isnt a person yet, which is why religious people like to use this term. Its bait. If you fall for it, not keeping in mind its definition you end up arguing that its ok to kill babies that are fully born because they arent persons yet.We arent talking about persons -this requires a personality and a developed brain which starts somewhere at 2 years old.\n\nDeath cannot be defined by cell destruction. Death is defined by brain death, not heartbeat or lung function. And you mistakenly took my \"breathes autonomously\" as literal, or as a definition of the beginning of a person/life.This is defined like this because its the only definition that isnt open to interpretation.\n\nDefining death as the destruction of cells has so many problems, its amazing to me that you dont see them.First of all you dont need to destroy any cells to kill a human.Depriving them of oxygen can make their cells just stop working.Second, we start holding funerals for fertilized eggs that didnt hold to the womb wall.Third, youre classified dead every 7 years once every atom in your body is replaced by atoms of the food you ate.\n\nWe have no good reason to define death as a destruction of cells in the first place. Unless you believe that a soul exists.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA soul that starts at conception is the only argument you can possibly have to justify the argument that abortion is murder. And souls do not exist.\n\nThe clinical definition of death isnt conditional to states being irreversible. You cannot apply this to a fetus because you cannot kill something that isnt a separate entity anyways.Its the potential of an entity and this is not the same moral dilemma as an actual formed entity.",

There are a few circumstances outside of that when abortion is allowed, but the position on abortion that has been held for centuries is more akin to the old Democrat position of \"safe, legal and rare\" than to the modern Democrat position of \"get whatever abortion you want whenever you want, it's your right.\"",

The legal precedent seems to stipulate that it\u2019s more of a community decision, based especially on a rabbis input, than an individual one.  However, within this context, the US Government denying people the right to abortion is denying religious rights to Jews, as abortion is codified in Jewish law *under certain circumstances*.

All the potential risks of childbirth that may necessitate an abortion until that point have passed.\n\n>2. What specifically about the moment of birth changes the status of the baby from part of the mother to their own person? This is the foundational part I don't understand.

Delivery itself can pose life-threatening medical risk, and therefore the mother has the right to decide whether or not she undergoes that risk. Once the baby is delivered, those risks are no longer relevant. It has nothing to do with personhood but rather the mother's bodily autonomy.",

Meaning relying on her to survive. That's the aspect your original point focuses on. \n>\n\nOk, so?\n\n>You're talking about the fringe situations of birth complications though. According to Johns Hopkins only 8 or so percent of births have complications that may threaten the mother. A majority of the births go off without a hitch. That minor percentage chance of complications isn't justification to abort a late term baby.  If there are no pre existing signs of complications prior to birth your argument makes no sense. The problem with that is the preventive action (abortion) to avoid that small percentage chance of complications includes ending the life of an existing human. Being inside the womb and relying on the mother for sustenance doesn't change that. That baby has every necessary thing to exist outside of the womb. It's only a matter of time at that point.\n>\n\nIt absolutely is justification to abort. If a mother is facing harmful birthing complications and decides she doesn't want to go through with it due to the risk that's entirely her right. Honestly, even if there are no identified risks, delivering a baby is painful and traumatic even when it goes well. No woman should be forced to go through with it against her will.\n\n>The chance of a possible complication/injury/death for the mother isn't comparable to the 100% chance of death a late term abortion causes. One is a minor chance the other is a full garuntee. They both suck but it's clear what the correct moral choice should be.\n>\n\nYes, the mother has the final say over what happens to her body.\n\n>If the unlikely instance occurs where during birth there is an issue and the parents have to make the terrible decision of either saving themselves or saving the baby then that's a situation where it makes sense to choose yourself over the child. That's the rare occurrence though. We're talking about the normal situation where there aren't any signs of complications at any point.\n\nLike I said above, even normal uncomplicated childbirth involve a painful vaginal delivery with inherent risk, or an invasive c-section which also carries risk. The mother has the right to decide not to go through with it, even at the last minute. It's her choice to deliver or not, since she's the one delivering or undergoing invasive surgery either way.",

That's a terrible reason to just say nah let's get rid of it.>\n\nWhy?\n\n>Every mother I've ever heard speak about thier children say yea it was painful obviously but they wouldn't trade it for the world because of the pure bliss they experienced when they held their child in their hands.>\n\nThat's anecdotal and also irrelevant.\n\n>If they didn't want the kid in the first place then they should have aborted early on when there isn't a living human inside them. I am pro choice up to a certain point in the pregnancy. \n>\n\nThere isn't a living human inside a pregnant mother at any point, just a fetus. Women are allowed to change their mind about having a baby. Also, sometimes things change in a woman's life that makes them unable or unwilling to raise a child. They shouldn't be forced to go through with it if they don't want to.\n\n>You're painting a narrative like the norm is bad. It's not. Most of the time, and that's what we're talking about not the fringe situations, it isn't a life risking/traumatic event. \n>\n\nIt's literally physically traumatic no matter what method of delivery is used. It either involves invasive surgery with lengthy healing time or painful vaginal delivery that tears tissue and often requires stitches and recovery time. To say it's not traumatic or painful is naive and/or ignorant.\n\n>If the mother is chilling like a week before her delivery date and has had zero signs of complications there is zero justification for aborting.>\n\nNope. A woman's justification for abortion can be as simple as not wanting to go through the delivery process or being unable to care for the baby.\n\n>Being scared of potential pain is a bullshit reason.>\n\nWhy?\n\n>So because they don't want to experience that painful event (which we have modern science and medicine to minimize that aspect) that means the baby's life is not worth anything?>\n\nNo, it means the mother's autonomy over her body takes precedence over whatever the baby's life is worth. You're not the one going through delivery, so you don't get to tell a woman what she does with her body.\n\n>You're trying to equate two things that aren't equal. Her pain and discomfort during birth is significantly less terrible than the death of a baby.>\n\nHow and why? Also, it's not a baby, it's a fetus. You're the one trying to equate two unequal things: abortion with infanticide.",

It's literally a badge of honor for most women.\n>\n\nThat's fine. If some women don't want to go through with it, that's also fine. You keep saying \"large portion\" and \"most women\" and then completely ignoring the minority of women as if their experience doesn't count.\n\n>\"it's a fetus and not a baby\" at that point what is the difference?\n>\n\nWhen it is delivered from the womb.\n\n>Location?\n>\n\nOutside the womb.\n\n>The child is perfectly viable and ready to live outside of the womb at this point.

Outside of reasons like protecting the health of the mother / rape incest / etc - almost nobody believes you should be allowed to abort a healthy baby right before birth.  But how about one month before birth? Two months? Four months?  Six months? Eight or nine months?  \n\nWell... yes, most abortion proponents believe seven to nine months before birth is perfectly fine.  But somewhere in that range of months, everyone is making a personal decision about their comfort level with babies being aborted at various stages.  People who oppose abortion are just at *zero months* on that same spectrum, while abortion supporters are all sitting on this continuum at some month greater than zero. Because the pro-life vs. pro-choice debate is often framed in an all-or-nothing sort of way, however, as if it's either some unfettered right or no right at all, it never delivers the option that *most people* actually want, which is to allow abortion but with limits on the stage of pregnancy, usually up to around 3/4/5 months along.\n\nOther counties view abortion more clinically as just an early-stage pregnancy form of birth control and treat it as such, but limit it to only the first few months of pregnancy. Abortion opponents have done a great job preventing this framing from ever being presented as an alternative, so end up having an outsized voice in terms of convincing people that abortion shouldn't be allowed at all.",

To your point, the vast majority of women wouldn't choose to abort at the 8th month of their pregnancy - but do you believe they should be allowed to?",

What happens is that more women die. \nThey die from unsafe illegal abortions. \nThey die from not being able to seek medical help without punishment. \nThey die from medical emergencies where abortion is the only safe alternative but oops too bad you die now, because a fully formes human with memories and consciousness and loved ones are less important than cells.\n\n2. Pregnancy is dangerous. People still die giving birth. People get chronic illnesses from birth and pregnancy. Being pregnant and giving birth changes the body forever. \n\n3. Bodily autonomy. You should have a say in what happens with your body. \n\n4. So many people can't afford kids, don't want kids, are in unsafe home situations, have mental or physical illnesses that make having a child and raising a child very difficult, and forcing them to doesn't end well. It ends, in a lot of situations, in poverty, abuse and pain. \n\n\n\nYou're focusing on abortion as \"taking a life\" (I don't agree it's a life, but I doubt we will agree on that issue) and completely ignore what the pregnant person has to go through.",

Good luck distinguishing it from a booger, and good luck actually looking people straight in the eyes while you tell them that the unfeeling booger is worth inflicting their suffering.
