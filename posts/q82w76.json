They feel that it's the mans job to not only be the sole provider but even come home and do everything. Cooking, cleaning, laundry all of it while she just lays there like a sloth.\n\nIn conclusion what they want is a not a man, not a partner, not a husband, but instead a living walking wallet that they can ride while draining it of all resources until there's nothing left as she proceeds to then cheat in order to feel satisfied while pulling the victim card.",

That's a bit of a problem, because I still think that feminism is a dangerous ideology that needs opposition. However, I have nothing but contempt for idiots who conflate individual women who do stupid (but harmless) things with feminism or all women, and your misogyny (can't believe I have to say that unironically) only provides ammunition for feminists.\n\nI want an antifeminism that is competent and expresses actual criticisms of the feminist ideology, not an antifeminism that is just about men whining about how much they can't stand women because they saw a few videos of a few spoiled women being narcissistic.\n\nPeople like you will be the death of antifeminism. I hope you understand that. And if you can manage to push me away from antifeminism, then feminists deserve complete control over society. \n\nSince you suggested it, I'll unsubscribe. I hope you are proud. Point feminism.",

Just the other day I posted a long criticism of feminist research on the wage gap and explained how  of the most frequently cited sources (by feminist) on the topic are severely flawed.\n\n>No one has a monopoly on anti-antifeminist sentiment.\n\nTrue, because we don't subscribe to a single ideology. But political organizing is vital for any idea, ideology, or in this case, anti-ideology to spread. If one of our most prominent avenue of organization is corrupted by petty whining about women, then I don't really see the general public even considering siding with us.\n\nTo make matters worse, those of us who are trying to maintain the credibility of this subreddit are being told that if we don't like the direction things are going, we should just leave. The antifeminist subreddit now belongs to the whiners and the misogynists and the low-fruit pickers. By all means, give it your best shot and see how effective this strategy will be at dismantling feminism. I've already given up on people in general, so when you fail miserably, I won't feel like I've lost anything.",
