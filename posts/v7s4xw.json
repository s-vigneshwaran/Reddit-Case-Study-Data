The act of hijacking would be years in prison and tens to hundreds of thousands in fines if you did it to just one local town. And are you going to be doing that across the nation? Not to mention satellite or physical cable tv. Unless you'd rather go to the source at Fox News, which would just require some combination of breaking-and-entering, blackmail/extortion and/or assault, which would give them a perfect martyrdom story that for the first time would actually be well-deserved.\n\nUnless by \"we\" you mean the FCC and/or Congress, some of the sole people who could actually do something like that? Ignore how that'd pretty much be guaranteed to be unconstitutional for the government to enforce something like that. I think the only *real* option is some quadribajillionaire buying them out, but then corporate lobbyists would just prop up the TV-friendly nutjobs on some other service.\n\nIn short, unless you're actually advocating for violent revolution (which I believe is against Reddit T&C) or are comfortable being the one who's made destitute and thrown in jail trying something stupid, please suggest more realistic solutions.",

It was only two days ago that I saw them cover it.",
