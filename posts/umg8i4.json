You are correct that an airplane's wings do not flap. You are wrong that an ORNITHOPTER does not flap its wings or that it just glides. Given that u/steinah6 is referring to ornithopters and you are referring to airplanes, we wind up with the proverbial apples to oranges comparison.\n\nIn case you may not have been aware I will provide some resources for your reference and edification:\n\nAbout Ornithopters: [https://www.britannica.com/technology/ornithopter](https://www.britannica.com/technology/ornithopter)\n\nDetails about an ornithopter with more natural/fluid \"flapping\" that flew successfully on July 31, 2010: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTIAS\\_Snowbird#Flight\\_test\\_history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTIAS_Snowbird#Flight_test_history)\n\nVideo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57I-Rf50NbQ\n\nPage with some videos of amateurs piloting ornithopters from inside (these are clunky!): http://ornithopter.net/MediaGallery/Videos/index\\_e.html\n\nCommercial, private, and military airplanes do not use ornithopter mechanics to get airborne or retain altitude, but there absolutely ARE aircraft that flap their wings to gain and maintain altitude. The impracticality of ornithopters isn't the question but rather whether or not they represent aircraft that mimic the flapping of a bird's wings to achieve flight. I don't suggest it is a viable form of flight, but it does exist.",

But the drones had a bit of an odd flight pattern due to the large amount of boiling water mixing with the jetstream in unexpected ways. So when Cl\u00e9ment Ader\u00a0patented his designs for a flying machine in 1875 he wanted to make it clear that it would fly like a _natural_ bird, not a steam-powered bird drone.

          "text": "Airplanes actually don't act like birds, although some of their controls were inspired by observations about bird flight.\n\nBefore the Wright brothers came along, there were actually many people working independently on powered flight with many different ideas about how to do it. But most required that the vehicle stay level, like terrestrial vehicles. The Wright brothers didn't really invent wings or an airplane engine. It really wasn't that hard to throw some wings around an engine and propeller and crash it into something because nobody could fly it straight. The big problem the Wright brothers solved was how to control a vehicle that was flying. The biggest insight that others at the time missed was that they could use fixed wings and tilt the airplane to turn it.\n\nThis insight actually came from observing birds because birds will change the angle of their wings to turn while they are gliding. However, the very name of the device - a fixed wing aircraft - demonstrates how very unbirdlike it is.\n\nAircraft that work by flapping their wings like birds are called ornithopters. The idea was popular before the Wright brothers invented modern control surfaces for fixed wing aircraft, and people like Otto Lilienthal worked on this idea. Oddly enough, it became easier to build ornithopters after the Wright brothers solved the flight control problem and powered fixed-wing flight became a reality. The first working ornithopters came in the 1930s but could not take off on their own. Instead, they had to be towed into the air by a fixed-wing aircraft.",

Personally I used two things when I was younger - I just kind of know it now. \n\n1. On a map, east is where Japan is and that just stuck for me so in any map if I put north at the top I know East is where Japan is on the world map. Doesn't have to be Japan, just something you know. Not overly helpful if the question is 'Is New York on the east or west coast of America' because then you're like well is it closer to Japan or further away, and on a globe it's further even though on a 2D map it's closer, so I always had to make sure I was thinking about the map and not the globe for that reason\n\n\n2. On a compass I'd do E is backwards 3 and 3 o'clock is *there* if North is at 12. \n\nThey are sort of mnemonics and only one relies on knowing clocks. Maybe it'll help someone",

              "text": "They're called backronyms. Because they were invented long after the word started being used. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backronym \n  \nAnother example is the word chav, which is kinda the British equivalent of redneck, more or less. Or like the word \"trashy\" except it refers to a type of person rather than a single personality trait. It's usually teens and young adults, wearing tracksuits (normally Adidas) and they go round breaking the law in minor ways like smoking before they're 18, carrying around knives, vandalism etc.\n  \nBut some people are daft enough to believe the word \"chav\" actually comes from the phrase \"Council House and violent\". Ignoring for a moment the fact that it's incredibly stupid and offensive to claim that all poor people are naturally more inclined to be violent - just because someone can only afford to live in a council house doesn't mean they're violent or bad people - it's just a weird description. It doesn't really capture who they are.\n  \nBut either way it's a backronym. It was invented long after the word \"chav\" began being used by everyone in the country (except for the parts of the country that use other names, like in the North West they call chavs \"scallies\" but it means the same thing; but the vast majority of of the country uses \"chav\").\n  \nThe word \"chav\" is actually a Romani/Irish-Traveller word. It comes from the Romani word \"chavo\" which means \"youth\" or \"young boy\". It does not mean \"Council House and violent\", and it's literally never meant that. It's not an acronym.",

              "text": "The thing you have to understand about English spelling is that English is the product of influence from many different languages, including from many different language families. English is a Germanic language, meaning it's part of the same family as German and the Scandinavian languages among others, but English has *significant* influence from Romance languages due to Britain having come under the occupation of the Normans (who were themselves Frenchmen descended from Norse invaders)\n\nIn Norman Britain, the language of the aristocracy was Norman French, while the language of the common people was the much more Germanic Old English, and the two combined to give us Middle English, which evolved into our modern English today. This means we have words like \"shirt\" which are of Germanic descent and follow certain Germanic spelling conventions, while we have words like \"manoeuvre\" that are of Romantic descent and follow certain Romantic spelling conventions.\n\nThen, on top of this, English underwent something called the \"great vowel shift\" where, for some reason, everyone suddenly started pronouncing English vowels differently, but the spellings didn't change to reflect this, For instance, a long, drawn out \"o\" sound became a \"u\" instead, which is why words like \"book\" and \"hook\" are pronounced and spelled the way that they are.\n\nPlus, the regular sound changes that happen over time - for instance, english lost the phoneme /x/ (a sort of guttural hissing sound like German 'ch' or Russian 'x') which used to be present in words like \"night\", \"fight,\" \"right\" etc. The \"gh\" originally represented that sound, but when it was lost, we ended up skipping that sound but keeping the spelling.",

In English, the first known acronyms (as opposed to plain old initialisms) cropped up in the telegraphic code developed by Walter P. Phillips for the United Press Association in 1879. The code abbreviated \u201cSupreme Court of the United States\u201d as SCOTUS and \u201cPresident of the...\u201d as POT, giving way to POTUS by 1895. Those shorthand labels have lingered in journalistic and diplomatic circles -- now joined by FLOTUS, which of course stands for \u201cFirst Lady of the United States.\u201d](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/19/magazine/19FOB-onlanguage-t.html)\n\nSo I guess if it's from a language like ancient Greek, it might be an acronym, but if it's an English word that's more than about 150 years old, it almost certainly isn't an acronym.",

ASAP, however, also qualifies as an acronym because it is made up of the initial letters of the phrase it comes from: as soon as possible.\n\nRadar is a well known acronym, but it is also an abbreviation, not strictly an initialism.\n\nRAdio Detection And Ranging\n\nIMAX is an intersecting one because the shortened form can either be derived from Image MAXimum\n\nI'm pretty sure the general rule is that the letters must be an abbreviation or initialism derived from the first 3 letters of the words involved and the resulting thing must spell a word for it to be considered an acronym",

Phillips for the United Press Association in 1879. The code abbreviated \u201cSupreme Court of the United States\u201d as SCOTUS and \u201cPresident of the...\u201d as POT, giving way to POTUS by 1895. Those shorthand labels have lingered in journalistic and diplomatic circles -- now joined by FLOTUS, which of course stands for \u201cFirst Lady of the United States.\u201d](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/19/magazine/19FOB-onlanguage-t.html)\n\nThat presumably explains why they're so rare. We've only had about 150 years to accumulate them.\n\nIt should also make you skeptical of any time anyone claims a much older word is an acronym (like the popular myths about NEWS, GOLF or FUCK, for example). Nobody really did that with English words prior to the late 1800s.",

Languages never \"lose\" the ability to express something, it's just the way that thing is expressed changes.\n\n\"Literally\" is now synonymous with \"figuratively,\" but you can still express the former meaning with \"really\" \"genuinely\" \"honestly\" etc etc.\n\nI speak Punjabi, which has grammatical gender and hard-coded formality. When I speak to someone who is above my social station in Punjabi, I have to speak in an entirely different formal register. English doesn't have that, but that doesn't mean English lacks a way to express respect for people above your social station.\n\nEnglish lacks what in other languages is something very basic - hard-coded grammatical aspect, but again, that doesn't mean we're incapable of expressing aspect, it just means you have to use a phrase like \"he used to run\" instead of 'used to' (i.e., the past habitual) being conjugated onto the verb (like the simple past tense 'ran' is)\n\nAnyway the point is, there's literally never a reason to be a prescriptivist, a language never loses the ability to distinguish between things that it has a reason to distinguish between.

The term was preceded in English by the word initialism, meaning an abbreviation formed from the initial letters of a phrase, and which has been in use since the late 19th century.\n\n> Some people feel strongly that acronym should only be used for terms like NATO, which is pronounced as a single word, and that initialism should be used if the individual letters are all pronounced distinctly, as with FBI. Our research shows that acronym is commonly used to refer to both types of abbreviations.\n\nPersonally I'm not all that concerned with what \"some people feel strongly\", and am happy to follow the common usage",

Similar developments are found in the Slavic languages \u2013 namely the Czech and Slovak noviny (from nov\u00fd, \"new\"), the cognate Polish nowiny, the Bulgarian novini, and Russian novosti \u2013 and in the Celtic languages: the Welsh newyddion (from newydd) and the Cornish nowodhow (from nowydh).[1][2]\n\nThe beliefs that \"news\" is derived from an acronym of the phrase \u201cNotable Events, Weather, and Sports\u201d, or that it is formed from the first letters of the compass (North, East, West, South) are incorrect, or would be considered examples of a backronym.[3]",
