The flip side of all this is access to food and a 3rd major international port in TX. \n\nRight now, the US is one of the only industrialized countries that produces more food than we consume. That would no longer be true of a Union made up of just the blue states. There would be a slight balancing of the GDP in fact provided the red states would sell the food to the blue states. Moreover, there are some things like natural gas and gasoline that would favor the red states too. However, the blue states would probably pretty quickly turn to renewables for power so I don\u2019t think that\u2019s as big of a balancer as food would be.\n\nLastly, there is a major supply chain issue in our country right now. The two major international trade ports (both coastal - east and west) are strained and Texas is offering a promising 3rd alternative right now. Like Chicago did in the 19th century, Texas is a centrally-located spot that could stand to boom from international trade. However, doing so will cause an increase in urban density which is the number one correlating factor with blue voting. Essentially as Texas grows and becomes more successful, it will likely become more blue.\n\nIn a way, this is an allegory for the real problem in America today which is that empty land shouldn\u2019t be given voice in politics. Democracy has always been based on the idea of equal voices for all participants and our system over-states the voice of those in less densely populated areas right now. That\u2019s a major flaw in our system",

A pawn of Putin.  Fascists Americans love Russia and Putin.  They see a divided America as a step forward in global fascist control.  They foresee an alliance between the fascist part of America and Russia.  Now while Russia technically isn't fascist, it is highly compatible with right-wing authoritarianism. \n\nJust look at the latest news about another fascist POS in congress named Madison Cawthorn.  Trip to Europe, hops a boat to Russia, meets a U.S. Army Captain who later invites him to a fake fitness competition in Miami to get him in the room with a Russian woman who Cawthorn marries and gets divorced from less than a year later.  All these fascists should be considered compromised.  Actively working against the integrity of the U.S.  Putin said it himself.  The U.S. has to be taken down from within, and it's literally unfolding in front of our eyes.",

But, your understanding of military members being expected to \u201cfollow orders because they signed a piece of paper\u201d is lacking. To them it\u2019s not just a piece of paper, it\u2019s a lifestyle and it\u2019s honor. They are bound to uphold and defend the constitution, and I assure it\u2019s not something done lightly or without regard. That paper defines who they are down to their very core. They believe in it, they trust it and they put their lives in the line for it. Because when you take orders from the top to kill people, you have to know why and it needs to be justifiable.\\\nYou are correct, up until recently the military has tended to lean to the Right, if not outright ruby red in some cases. And the reason for that isn\u2019t what you think. It doesn\u2019t have to do with the border, it doesn\u2019t have to do with social programs or a fiscal responsibility. It literally has to do with self preservation. Traditionally the Democrats have pushed to reduce the military budget and close bases, that is where their opposition has come from. But, Trump (in his usual self defeating fashion), changed that during his presidency with how he acted towards Generals Kelly and Mattis and his comments about members being \u2018suckers and losers\u2019. Those Generals are highly highly respected and loved in military circles. His comments were a betrayal and as such things have changed dramatically.\\\nIn 2016 Trump took about 40% of the military votes while Clinton took about 20%. Fast forward to the 2020 election and Biden (for the first time in years), took the majority with around 41% while Trump took around 37%. That is a radical swing no matter how you spin it. Sentiment has changed dramatically and honestly for the better.\\\nSo your scenario of the military backing a coup in this country, is extreme hyperbole I\u2019m afraid. It literally would never happen unless the Pentagon were on board with it and they most certainly are not. It\u2019s the reason Donald didn\u2019t get his military parade (remember that? Seems like eons ago), because the Pentagon said \u201cNo, we aren\u2019t doing that. You can get a flyover and some pretty vehicles on the lawn and that\u2019s it\u201d.\\\nNow your estimation on the police? As much as it pains me to say it, you hit that one out of the park. You are dead on. And personally that\u2019s more scary to me. And it\u2019s why I changed my stance on gun ownership. I\u2019ve come a full 180\u00b0 on it. When mass shootings were happening every week it seemed like, I was all in on gun control. And then I talked to my neighbor and he talked about owning his because of the crazy \u2018red hats\u2019. In 2016, I bought my first. And I\u2019ve been in support ever since. And I\u2019ll be straight, it\u2019s nice to see a lot of Left Leaning gun owners popping up in social media sites. More and more all the time.\\\nAnyway, that\u2019s my two cents. Be safe, be well.",

If you go that route spend some coin on a good shotgun (Have a beautiful Weatherby Orion D Italia I bought to shoot trap (field gun however) and only did two rounds, PM Me if interested. Not sure why as previously I went a couple times a week. A good Trap gun will cost you 1400 on up. https://www.americanrifleman.org/content/weatherby-orion-d-italia-ii/\nI loved the long range game with rifles and it's the only real way you can afford to shoot now days. You can get an out of box Savage that is well beyond your or even most experienced shooters accuracy capabilities and have fun. The rule of thumb for a decent scope is to spend as much as you did on your rifle. https://www.cabelas.com/shop/en/savage-10t-sr-bolt-action-rifle\n.308 is actually a very popular caliber in this regard with the experienced long range shooters as it is cheap (was) and allows you to shoot thousands of rounds (unlikely) and never have to worry about replacing a barrel. \nThe Magnum rounds burn up Barrel. I shot a 300 win mag 1000 yard F Class and the barrel life is maximum 800 shots, so I am half way there or more. However I went that route as less adjustment since it had less bullet drop, example mine dropped roughly 18 feet at 1000 yards. Altitude, Humidity, wind and rotation of earth (East West) factor in of course. \nIf you want the semi auto with a magazine a M1A1 match will make you a rock star, but anytime you shoot semi auto you burn through more rounds. I also have a Cetme that I am considering getting rid of which would only need a trigger for shooting a few hundred yards they kick ass. \nWith a bolt action you can practice site alignment and trigger pull with \"Snap Caps' or dummy rounds at home. Lots of that makes you a better shooter, even beyond shooting real rounds. Knowing math and your scope puts the bullet where you want it, although with lots of money modern scopes adjust automatically! \nUsually at the 1000 yard I would maybe shoot 10 shots a day as we let our barrels cool between shots. Shooting long range is fun as hell, lots of Algebra and Calculus if you stay old school as a .308 round will drop about 36 feet in a thousand yards, now put that bullet on a 10 inch plate....\nThe Shotgun of course gives you both means. For home invaders it's perfect. Trap ranges are usually closer or even in town for close trips and lots of fun. \nGood luck, either way say goodbye to your bank account :P especially Trap, if money is an option I would avoid this as most will shoot thousands upon thousands of trap rounds a year. Initial cost and ammo are far higher do to more time at the range.",

I'm a sucker for thoughtful design in general, and I've yet to find a bad review of it. Probably not ideal for trap lol but versatile, great for home defense and by all accounts -very- fun to shoot.\n\nI hadn't really considered a long range rifle since it didn't strike me as ideal self defense for the suburbs, but that's a very good point about the rate at which you use ammo - and the math is cool! \n\nThere's a certain appeal to an AR-15 style platform or something similar and really making it your own with all the options for upgrades, accessories and so on. I'm sure it will all cost more than I anticipate, but on the other hand, the part of my budget alotted for social stuff has largely gone unused in pandemic life.",

It turns out you need educated people to make drones and fighter jets.\n\nNorthrop Grumman is a perfect example. They designed the Stealth Bomber and they're working on a future land-based ICBM system.\n\nThey're based in Connecticut with their Aeronautics division in Redondo, California because it turns out that's where all the smart people are at. All these hippies are building UAVs, the new F-35 Lightning, cargo transports, and reconnaissance vehicles.\n\nTheir Mission Systems is in Linthicum, Maryland. They produce a shit ton of radar sensors, and they are in charge of producing and maintaining AWACS for the US, UK, NATO, and allies.\n\nTheir Defense Systems are in McLean, Virginia. They provide training and systems for the military.\n\nSo imagine MAGAstan trying to fight a war against the actual educated part of the country that produces all the fucking aircraft, spy satellites, UAVs, night vision goggles, cargo transports, ships, steal aircraft, modern fighter jets, and logistics. It would a fucking shit show. And who would foreign nations side with. First of all, most would not risk getting involved in an internal dispute in a nuclear superpower, but if they did, they'd fucking well support the part of the country that's also making all this shit for them as well.",

      "text": "I've written before about why a MAGA civil war would be a hilarious, albeit horrific, failure. Just for the lols, I'm going to repost this here.\n\n---\n\nI live in a MAGA state (Arkansas). MAGAts don't want to be Wermacht. You don't need to worry about that. They don't have the stomach for it. They want to be Einsatzgruppen. The Wehrmacht were actual military that conquered territory. They were hardened soldiers who had to suffer deprivation and put their lives at risk. The Einsatzgruppen were paramilitary groups that slept in comfy beds, had their morning coffee, and then went around already conquered areas terrorizing and committing mass exterminations, full well knowing they could run back behind the Wermacht's skirts if anyone really stood up to them.\n\nMAGAts and militia groups see themselves as Wermacht, but they're really just Einsatzgruppen. They aren't going to rise up and actually work together to make coordinated attacks. You can see that with the January 6th coup attempt. The Trump partisans' plans were pretty fucking weak. Ultimately, they were relying on the military or the police swinging their way and allowing them to just terrorize congress. When that didn't happen, they fell back on rioting and acts of petty terrorism.\n\nAnd even if there was an actual attempt at Civil War, the MAGA states would get curb stomped quickly for the same reason Rhett Butler told Ashley Wilkes the South would get curb stomped.\n\nFirst of all, the only contiguous MAGA region is the South. The rest of the MAGA movement are rural dwellers spread out thinly across large states, which makes them mobilizing pretty fucking unlikely.\n\n> Rhett Butler: I think it's hard winning a war with words, gentlemen.\n> \n> Charles Hamilton: What do you mean, sir?\n> \n> Rhett Butler: I mean, Mr. Hamilton, there's not a cannon factory in the whole South.\n> \n> Man: What difference does that make, sir, to a gentleman?\n\nSecond, the South has a lot of manufacturing now, but it's not exactly a hotbed of genius and innovation. The few bright spots in the South are stuff like NASA being in Alabama and Florida which has more to do with government funding and those being good locations for launches. Just like the MAGAts don't understand that Jim Bob boycotting Starbucks isn't probably hurting their business because Jim Bobs don't go to Starbucks anyway, they don't understand that the people who design all the drones and tanks and aircraft aren't morons. So they're either leaning liberal or they're the kind of conservative who isn't going to put their career on the line for a stupid temper tantrum.\n\n> Rhett Butler: No, I'm not hinting. I'm saying very plainly that the Yankees are better equipped than we. They've got factories, shipyards, coalmines... and a fleet to bottle up our harbors and starve us to death. All we've got is cotton, and slaves and... arrogance.\n> \n\nThird, the (lol) coastal elites own the fucking coasts. They own the fucking shipyards. The entire Pacific Coast fleet is in liberal enclave states. A large part of the Atlantic Coast fleet is docking and being built in places like New Jersey, New York, and other liberal enclaves.\n\nHere are the current active Naval Shipyards.\n\n\n|Shipyard|City|State|Year||Duties|\n|------------------|------------|----|------|---|------------------------------------------|\n| Norfolk NSY      | Portsmouth | VA | 1767 |   | Maintains ships of the Atlantic Fleet    |\n| Pearl Harbor NSY | Honolulu   | HI | 1908 |   | Maintains ships of the Pacific Fleet     |\n| Portsmouth NSY   | Kittery    | ME | 1800 |   | Maintains nuclear submarines             |\n| Puget Sound NSY  | Bremerton  | WA | 1901 |   | Decommissions nuclear-powered submarines |\n| Coast Guard Yard | Baltimore  | MD | 1899 |   | Maintains Coast Guard cutters and craft  |\n\nJust like in the Civil War, the South would essentially be a landlocked, low-income, low-education shithole going up against the full might of the US military. The few MAGAts that defected from higher levels of command wouldn't make up for the vast material differences in production, design, and access to resources that the non-MAGAt side would be able to bring to bear. And even if the South could keep its coasts unblockaded, which countries would risk the ire of the US government in trading with them. Who overseas likes MAGAts other than the Russians? And I think even Putin wouldn't risk arming them.\n\nAn actual attempt at a MAGAt uprising would be doomed to failure.",
