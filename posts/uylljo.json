Blood means money, and these companies have known for years that their weapons are sold to gunrunners all the time but to them it\u2019s clean money.

People are angry and grieving, but folks expecting the cops to rush in and take out the bad guy like it\u2019s an 80\u2019s action movie aren\u2019t thinking logically.  Without real combat training it is a very rare individual who could rush into a situation where a crazed gunman is obviously looking for any target to kill.  If a cop were to rush in and try some cowboy shit there\u2019d likely be collateral damage, and then we\u2019d be angry at that.\n\nThe cops aren\u2019t the main issue here.  They wouldn\u2019t even be in this position as often as they are if it wasn\u2019t easier to get guns with the capability of killing 30 people in under a minute than it is for a woman to get proper reproductive health.  Megatron can\u2019t be a fucking gun anymore, but Cabella\u2019s still has more variety of weaponry than my grocery store has potato chips right now.  Granted, the chips might be responsible for more death, but at least those folks die older, fat, and happy.",

Now bare with me. \nPerhaps the police officers didn\u2019t get adequate training for these kinds of extreme violent (domestic) terrorist attacks. An active shooter situation inside a building is an extremely complex thing to tackle.\nThat could lead to freezing in the face of said attacks out of fear, because you don\u2019t know what to do. \n\nNow assuming this. Imagine being a police officer and the attack happened. You are standing behind your police car with your colleagues, contemplating a plan of action. You\u2019re with 5 officers and 3 of them are refusing to go in, justifying it with what ever reason. Would you go in, without the training/knowledge of what to do and how to approach this situation? Alone, or with 1 buddy? \n\nThis situation should never occur obviously. But is it then the fault of these police officers or the fault of the system for not properly training these officers in the procedures? \n\nI don\u2019t have the exact details on this situation and obviously the government on all levels has been failing on this subject. \nBut I refuse to believe every single police officers over there was a coward and willfully neglected his duty.",

And they get away with it, because they were afraid. So to sum up: if you're unarmed and unthreatening but a cop thinks you're scary? He may murder you dead, and not face any consequences. Also, if a cop arrives on a scene where there is actual danger, they don't have to engage because it's so, so scary.",

And the police still mainly holds the same function. The Cops are not meant to do anything when the 1% steal billions from the public (through tax evidence or wage theft), but the police is meant to protect companies from theft. The police is not democratically elected and still is allowed to brutalize you. The system is further designed in a way that makes police rarely ever held accountable for their deeds (in the US this is extremely bad, but in other countries it isn't much better).\n\nThe police has been used to great extend in Britain for example to break labor power under the Thatcher regime and police has most probably helped actual Nazis get information on their victims in Germany (Google NSU and NSU 2.0).\n\nEven if you assume that the police only brutalized non-innocent people (which is factually simply wrong), the police would still have the power to violently harm people physically and mentally. These people aren't serial killers - where we might argue about the moral justice of these actions - but for normal people, who stole, used drugs, are homeless and desperately try to survive, who didn't have the money to buy a ticket to use public transport (literally puts many people in prison in germany), etc.\n\nThe police's job is to protect capital interests and to brutalize Minorities, labor organizers and poor people. That's why all Cops are bastatds, because even the best cop still has to serve in a system designed for bastardry.",

That said, no one who is against cops, would say that we should just abolish policing and be done. We need to defund or fully abolish police and at the same time create new, better systems that are actually designed to help the community instead of only sometimes turning out to be kinda helpful.\n\nTL;DR: We need other, better systems for policing, that are democratic in nature and that are actually designed to help the community",

I haven't heard from them since.\n\nIt makes me wonder why they didn't go further in 1A. \"A well educated citizenry, being necessary to carry out the will of the Great Lord of the White House, the right to speak freely shall not be infringed.\"\n\nOdd that they didn't write that, huh?

Just like the military, the police is part of the executive branch, not a militia.  Hence, if you can't specify what exactly you want to change in a complex system, it's easy for opponents to subvert any attempts on reforms - and that's what's have been happening for decades.\n\n>\"police can kill you if they say they feared for their life\" isn't the same as \"shoot as a last resort.\" \n\nSure it is. The problem in the US is that neither society nor polices help to avoid that moment. You have the usual treatment of weapons as common tools that need to be in everybody's hands, laws lacking means to enforce accountability, courts and juries favoring the police, discrimination, poorly regulated, corrupt unions, overly broad qualified immunity, short police training of less educated candidates, alienation with the communities, and so on.\n\nYou think the police abroad won't shoot you if they fear for their lives? They certainly will. It's just that a lot has to happen before they both end up in such a situation and can justify that fear or last resort.\n\n>Aren't police in America trained to respond to school shootings? Wouldn't that constitute \"trained to engage the threat?\"\n\nAre all of them? Besides, proper training includes imparting the confidence as well as willingness to engage a deadly situation in a realistic manner. I doubt many police officers know or even supposed to know what to do without backup or special teams.",

We probably have met and talked to a similar amount of people we can reliably trust (which isn't that many on the grand scale) my experience with cops has been, while not the opposite.

They aren't perfect and there are a lot of shitty ones according to the internet.\n.\n I still don't think they need to be removed however.  Even if it takes time for them to get there.  I would rather have the option for potential help rather than criminals literally have free reign to do whatever they want without fear of at least consequence.  Having a police force regardless of what they do is a deterrent to a lot of people.",

If someone is shooting at me I either hide and when that's not an option Im gonna die either way. Why do you need any kind of police other than special forces with special tactical gears anyways then.

If as they say risking their lives is not their job then they are useless as normal people with basic gun training would protect themselves just about the same and if people are not supposed to have guns and police armed and trained to be the ones that do, they are still useless as they demonstrated. In short police is useless whichever when it comes to actually handling threats and so might as well as defund and leave handling actual threats to citizens themselves.",

Gonzales* appears to be one of the more robust supreme court cases on this, and makes reference to several others such as *City of Chicago* *v. Jesus Morales et al.*\n\nThe core of it comes down to the 14th amendment affording a protection \"nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law;\" that frequently does not mean the state is responsible for an indirect deprivation of property due to the acts of a third party. The constitution does not obligate the police to protect you from 3rd parties in nearly all instances, with rare exceptions such as ongoing domestic violence in some states. It merely shields you from the police themselves.\n\nI am not a lawyer, this is not legal advice, and I truly welcome a constitutional lawyer to correct or clarify anything that my hasty readings of a handful of opinions got wrong.\n\nTL;DR Constitution only protects you from police, it doesn't require police to intervene for your protection from another party, *in most cases*.",

That's all they've ever existed for - as agents of the state empowered to use violence against its own citizenry in order to maintain a tiered class-based society. And I don't mean that's all *America's* police have existed for, I mean that's all that *any* police have existed for (ok, maybe there are notable exceptions in history that I'm not aware of, but the fact that they would be notable would make them the exception that proves the rule). They're an internal force that keeps society's structure intact as-is by state-sanctioned force. They protect a society's wealth from the lower classes, just like the military protects a society's wealth from external threat - both are extensions of the state intended to commit violence against a threat.\n\n\"We're here to serve the public\" is a more modern ideal that has been ascribed to them in democratic societies. In a monarchy or feudal system, no one mistakes the king's agents for anything but what they are. In a democracy, we are all (including the police themselves) told the lie that the police serve us all. They do not. And make no mistake - most people who are police truly believe that they are protecting and helping society, even while they abuse it (because it is for our own good). That lie about service exists and is reinforced by the monied interests for one purpose - to keep you docile and compliant in the face of violence and atrocity perpetrated by the state, via its agents, against its own people. \n\n\"Law and order\" doesn't mean equality or safety or protection - it means enforced class distinction and denial of class mobility. *Should* the police exist to serve us all? Absolutely. But they do not and never have.",

If five adults rushed into *the very room the shooter was in* and tackled the fucker simultaneously, the shooter would\u2019ve been subdued and maybe 3 more adults would have died.  There are countless incidents in which unarmed civilians managed to disarm active shooters, and not too many in which a sizable group that attempted to do so was unsuccessful.  If that happened toward the end of the shooting, yes, it would\u2019ve raised the death toll.  The cops were, however, sitting around for 40 minutes\u2014if a group of reasonably-coordinated parents had rushed in within the first five or ten, lives would likely have been saved rather than lost.\n\nYou can argue that parents are no more likely to actually risk their lives than cops (who may have also been parents of kids in the building), but this simply isn\u2019t true of decent parents.  I\u2019m quite sure there were enough parents (of children from the relevant classroom) at the scene to form such a group\u2014and given that it would have been *their kids* in that room, you bet your ass they\u2019d have risked their lives.\n\nNow, that sure as shit shouldn\u2019t be a decision parents should have to make\u2014all blame lies with the police\u2014but the police probably did *more harm* by preventing parents from intervening.\n\nAnother matter: the \u201cgood guy with a gun\u201d narrative is generally pretty bullshit, but that does change when the \u201cgood guy with a gun\u201d is the parent of a kid whose life is in danger.  Again, there were almost certainly a fair few armed parents waiting outside, at least some of whom would\u2019ve been willing to take such a risk.  There is a nontrivial risk of the parents shooting a bystander by way of poor aim, but this same risk exists with police\u2026and the police did fuck all anyhow.  The onus of civil defense should not lie with the layman. \n\nYet again, this sure as shit shouldn\u2019t be a decision parents should have to make\u2014all blame lies with the police\u2014but the police probably did *more harm* by preventing parents from intervening.  \n\nFootnote: *I support gun regulation.  American gun-culture and modern right-wing culture are complicit in the tragedy under discussion and bear as much blame as police inaction.*",

There was a university in town on one end of the main drags and at the other end were a bunch of ski resort hotels and a bunch of overpriced bed-and-breakfast type joints.\n\nThe cops would just sit every few blocks and play on their phones and do nothing. You'd see a half dozen students or poor locals pulled over for 'speeding' every time you'd go out but speeding was basically impossible because the amount of traffic was always sky high on the two roads, you'd basically always be stop and go, so you couldn't even really speed.\n\nI saw nothing but harassment of poor people and playing on cell phones the entire time I lived there. It was an absolute joke. After a few months it became completely obvious that the cops were there to nickel and dime the students with as many bullshit fines as possible and to keep the poors away from the rich tourists.",

Their budgets are so insanely out of proportion for what they can do, and then when the shit hits the fan and people need them they cower, because if they were actually brave they\u2019d join the military or at least go be a cop in a big city. But they aren\u2019t. They just want the respect that comes with being in uniform without the danger of having someone actually shoot at them.",

And yet, they still can't fill their need for 911 operators and may have to farm it out to the county. The operators are being forced into mandatory 12-16 hour days and must do overtime. So people find jobs elsewhere. Shocking, I know.",

If they just want to be glorified meter maids then they should be paid as such, and the funding they spend on all the surplus military equipment they use to harass minorities and oppress protestors should go to teachers.\n\nAlso, what the guy above mentioned about 911 dispatch being underfunded and understaffed is true, and it's a problem almost everywhere in America.

When you perpetually understaff shifts, to the point of being dangerous by not having enough officers on shift, only to turn around and strong arm the city council for more money to \"attract\" officers, I'd say that is money directly into their pockets. Higher base pay and a bigger coffer for overtime directly enriches police. When you create whole new positions because the chief lied to the city council when they said they could change the culture of the police department themselves. To then turn around the next year and demand an assistant police chief position be created, with a benefit and pay package that is close to $500k a year, because you can't do the job you said you were going to, in a city with a population of 125k. I could go on and on about corruption between the city manager and police chief that directly lined BOTH of their pockets, but I'd hit the character limit of the reply box pretty quickly. Suffice it to say  this also happens in much larger cities, too. This isn't a unique problem to a few police forces here or there, it's pretty systemic at this point.",

They used this time to restrain desperate parents trying to save their children because the police wouldn't. There will be a hero worship circlejerk in honor of these officers who are obviously unfit for the job. \n\n\n   The grand solution the politicians are offering is to put more guns directly in classrooms, and expect poorly paid teachers to be fucking Rambo with a few hours of training. They need to simultaneously keep a firearm and ammo out of reach of little kids while also being ready to deploy into close quarters combat at a moments notice. On top of all that most of these shooters are decked out in tactical gear so the likelihood of friendly fire in every direction is incredibly high...\n\nI feel like I am going fucking crazy. How are so many people this fucking stupid?",

Here is a cut and paste. \n\n\n\u201cThe police response to Columbine was heavily criticized at the time, leading to a drastic change in active shooter incident response nationwide. Immediate action rapid deployment (IARD) tactics replaced scene containment, leading to departments training and equipping personnel for solo officer response.\u201d \n\nThat\u2019s a bunch of fancy words. Everyone can read that shit again. They sold us on the idea that if we got a ton of tacticool gear for every cop they could better respond to active shooters even when the responder is solo. \n\nIf the police can\u2019t be relied on to respond as trained and we know they have no duty to protect. Why buy em plates, carriers and select fire rifles? They won\u2019t use it when it matters.",

Barricading him in is horrible police work, but laughably human to me - because I actually did that to an intruder in my own home once. I heard him racketing around in my basement in the early hours of the morning, and I just took all my living room furniture and jammed it between the basement door and opposite wall to trap him in there. And then I went to work, because I had no paid vacation days. I figured he could stay barricaded in my basement while I did my 8 hours, then I'd deal with him. \n\nI think \"conspiracy\" is what the right wing is trying to label this, because the reality is a worse narrative for them. The reality is that police in this country are dumbfucks by design, we disqualify ones who score too high on IQ tests. And dumbfucks by self-selection, we get a high percentage of anti-science religious nuts who are anti-vax, and are taught that critical thinking is bad. And we have a crisis with more guns than people in this country; and any nut job can get an assault rifle and unlimited ammo with no background checks. And cops cannot keep us safe in that environment. So either the right wing has to admit all that, or convince us this, and sandy hook, and all those other things we're seeing somehow aren't really what we're seeing, it's all a big conspiracy. Cause otherwise we have to overhaul the system that's keeping the NRA and those politicians rich, and we can't have that.",

But you just totally wrote off the option that they would get shot or die. You can't justify running in to the school if you won't acknowledge that being shot or killed was a possibility. Which was a very likely outcome.\n\n*Also, all the doors were locked*, remember? Your kid (and /or you) couldn't have run away. And the parents probably had no idea there was only one way out. \n\nAnd let's say they ran in just before SWAT arrive. Then SWAT has to figure out who's the bad guy? Pause so *they* don't accidentally kill someone? \n\nIt's a hopeless, tragic situation but all those parents are alive. You can't guarantee that would have happened had they gone in. Then we have families that lost a child and a parent.",

How is leaving a family without a child and a parent better? In this traditional community, that's probably the main breadwinner, too.\n\nI'm not blaming anyone for wanting to do anything to save their child, obviously, but that doesn't mean it would have made the situation better. Honestly, it's all a thought experiment at this point. Yes, some parents wanted to go in, but most did *not* attempt it. Are they bad parents? Do they care about their children less? Because that's the implication.",

Never seen a happier kiddo. \n\nWe sometimes go to a little park next to a police station and the police officers have never even said hello to us or acknowledged the little boy excitedly staring and pointing at the police cars. I am not saying they have to. I am just saying the difference in attitude is striking. Fire fighters are true heroes on and off duty.",

I agree the Parkland cops were dogshit but I don't see the union doing anything wrong here - it's a clear fuck-up by management.  Union contracts almost always have very clear rules about how and when mgmt can fire people - if mgmt is too incompetent to follow very clear straightforward rules - that's on them.",

If my kids were in that school and the police told me to wait while they stood around and did nothing, I would have no qualms about putting a bullet through each of their faces. I wouldn't feel the least bit of remorse. That's just me though. I would have to be dead before I let my babies be left in that situation. This isn't a judgement on the parents who couldn't do anything because the cops were being pieces of shit; I am trained for that sort of situation and I could handle it. \n\nWhat grinds my gears here with the whole \"the police aren't trained\" excuse is I find it highly unlikely not one police officer in that situation had zero active shooter training. They weren't all fresh hires,  there had to be at least one senior cop or a military veteran in that group. I find this excuse convenient and not truthful. \n\nI hope all the police officers who were present at that school and denied parents the chance to save their children get fired, are shunned and abandoned by their communities and families, and I hope they hear the screams of those kids for the rest of their lives. The only other fate they deserve is a public hanging. \n\nI am thoroughly disgusted with that police department.",

They are trained to be on the constant lookout for any and all perceived potential threats, and to act in their own best interest if they feel unsafe, even if that means to act first and deal with the consequences later. Years of being trained to see everyone as a perceived threat and to act in their own self interest leads to situations like the weak response to the Texas school shooting. \n\n  Most heroes on the force with ethics and morals are weeded out by necessity: they pose a threat to the powers that be, and cannot be allowed to blow the whistle on their fellow officers, or act ethically when that would be a hindrance to the way things are.  [Police are trained to see everyone as a potential threat, and treat them as such.](https://www.npr.org/2021/04/17/988331517/former-police-officer-says-training-methods-for-cops-need-to-change) Police already have extremely limited training to begin with, and the few hours they do receive are focused on 'Warrior Mentality': fear based approaches that prey on each individual's insecurities and biases, such as racial profiling and stereotyping. \n\n  [Then they are taught to use more violence](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/01/26/police-training-reform/) than they think necessary to deal with these threats, in order to minimise the potential danger they perceive to themselves, often by ex-military trainers as well as former police. After all, that's what qualified immunity is for: as the saying goes, 'It is better to ask for forgiveness, than permission'.\n\n   Everything looks like a nail, when all you know is the hammer.",

In the last 15 years our police only had to shoot 739 bullets in total at people, which in the end killed 126 people. Our homicide rate is also multiple times lower than the US (6 times to be precise), just like basically any other crime rate. That's  probably why we only want our police to have guns in public, since they do a pretty efficient and responsible job at protecting us. \n\n**If those numbers are correct** and you guys have to use your weapons at least 500,000 a year defensively, you're either a land of psychopaths who pull their gun on every minor incident or you're a land filled with criminals, which likely means you messed up socially. Either way, that would explain your high crime rates (escalation and/or flawed system which messes up people).",

It is stated to have been originally introduced with the rationale of protecting law enforcement officials from frivolous lawsuits and financial liability in cases where they acted in good faith in unclear legal situations.\n\nIn plain speak that means you can\u2019t sue police for *trying and failing* to do their job.

In other words, police are well within their rights to pick and choose when to intervene to protect the lives and property of others \u2014 even when a threat is apparent.\nIn both of these court cases, clear and repeated threats were made against the safety of children \u2014 but government agencies chose to take no action\"\n\nOr in 2021.....\n\n\"The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled in favor of police officers in two cases involving qualified immunity, the controversial legal doctrine that protects police officers accused of misconduct.\nThe two cases concerned police officers accused of using excessive force when responding to domestic disturbances. In one, officers used beanbag rounds and a knee on the suspect's back to subdue him; in the second, officers shot and killed the suspect after he approached them while raising a hammer.\nBoth decisions\u00a0the court issued Monday\u00a0were unsigned. No justices dissented.\nQualified immunity refers to a series of legal precedents that protect government officials \u2014 including police officers \u2014 accused of violating constitutional rights.\nTo win a civil suit against a police officer, complainants must show that the officer violated \"clearly established law,\" most often by pointing to factually similar previous cases. Otherwise, officers are protected from liability.\"\n\n.......it's cute how people, like you, try to custom pick what facts support their opinions, rather than base their opinions on the actual facts.......your claim that cops would be sued for everything is rediculous.",

Each city decides *by themselves for themselves* how to police each crime - which together makes up each individual departments *policies*. \n\nA specific department may or may not have a specific policy for what to do in a given situation. \n\nPolice officers are then expected to act in accordance those policies to their best ability and to the extent of the training that was provided to them (to inform them of these policies). So, if a town wants their cops charging straight in during a hostage situation, they can certainly have a policy like that and train their police in that manner. \n\nBeing a police officer is a job. If an officer isn\u2019t following and violating those policies - that\u2019s not a legal event, it just means they are bad at their job and they can get fired for it. \n\nIn some jobs, if you make a mistake, people may die. Many jobs are like that. If a surgeon makes a mistake people can die. If a truck driver makes a mistake, people can die. \n\nBut it\u2019s not a criminal offense to suck at a job. If you do your job poorly - you will get fired. There is no personal legal liability while performing a job and there is no employer liability as long as they tried their best to make sure you do a good job (aka they had policies in place and they trained their employees). \n\nThis is all working as intended, because we don\u2019t want to throw people in jail for sucking at their job.",

Is it exhausting being afraid all the time, so scared you need multiple death machines to protect you from your fellow citizens. Grasping the steel replacement for the strength you lack. Only feeling safe knowing you can kill because you are so emotionally broken you think everyone is out to get you in some way.  I just like the fact the gun owners are more likely to kill themselves or let their children kill themselves then they are to ever use a gun in self defense. https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/hicrc/firearms-research/gun-threats-and-self-defense-gun-use-2/",

The arrest portion of this scenario I have seen personally. That's the problem. Have you seen recently the republicans doing everything in the southern states to disenfranchise black voters? Are these the people you want to make gun laws? 'Cause pretty sure only white rednecks will get a license. And the right to own guns should not hinge year to year on the whim of government officials.\n\nWhat you state above is fine; fact is, I have no qualms with any of those things, if they were handled reasonably. But I know personally that you can buy guns out of the back of a Chevy Nova. I know that the neighbors have guns, and if I ***needed to*** I could steal one from them. Mexico is awash in this violence and pretty easy to get back across the border.  Prostitution is flat out illegal most places, and exists in most places. Pedos still trade in child porn. Shooting people is against the law but yet Detroit still hurts every weekend. \n\nAs a man raised to be fair and ethical, I will never buy a promise of security from an untrustworthy government. Trump and cronies mean to me that I will retain the right of self-defense.  I can say that the Supreme Court has been making me proud lately.  What we need is to sit down reasonably and work out these issues.  Gun control or no gun control, this shooting should not have happened. Leaving a back door to a McDonalds unlocked never happens. Why do this at a school?\n\nI of course hate that children were murdered. But we need real solutions that actually work to deal with the mental illness we have in the country now. They can erect fences around the white house and supreme court and other various monuments but fencing a school seems beyond their reach. Instead, the government wants my guns, and is willing to work the populace into a frenzy to get them. Sorry, not gonna work.",

Law enforcement in countries around the globe have the trust and respect of the public. It doesn't have to be this way in the US, and it certainly wouldn't be better if there was no law enforcement.\n\nI am curious, in real terms, what you think a society without law enforcement would look like? There's a reason nearly every country in the world has some kind of law enforcement. If people can break the law without any threat of repercussions, they will. The law does not enforce itself. A society without law enforcement is essentially a society without law. \n\nFor any large society to be happy and safe, I view law enforcement as a necessity. I agree that law enforcement in the US has taken disgusting turns for the worse over recent decades, and needs massive changes in almost all aspects, including ending qualified immunity, creating independent conduct investigations, increasing training and requiring a university/college degree to become a cop, and more.\n\nI take issue with the way the system has been executed, not the system itself. Law enforcement will always be a somewhat oppressive idea (state sponsored actors using violence as a means to enforce laws created by the state) but I do believe it is necessary for a functional society, and *can* be wielded appropriately.",

Why don't these human beings abandon whatever training, protocol or fear keeps that inner hero from taking over?

Let's say for example tomorrow magically everyone's guns are gone.  Is the government going to suddenly seize peoples property or illegally detain people?  It's not like a gun helps you stand up to authority overreach now, you just get shot.\n\nIf they they wanted to truly harm the public, a gun is going to do very little against a government backed by a bloated, runway military budget.  They'd just start bombing entire neighborhoods. These trained cops were too cowardly to save these kids against 1 shooter, do you think the average gun owner has a death wish were the government to come knocking?  \n\nWhat do you think would happen if there were stricter gun laws, we'd turn into North Korea?  Tons and tons of other counties have low gun ownership but the governments reach is still kept in check.

Defunding the police can mean creating specialized programs that protect our communities by decreasing the amount of unnecessary arrests.\n\nAlso AOC had a good quote about what defunding the police really looks:\n\nAsked, \"What does an America with defunded police look like to you?\" Ocasio-Cortez responded, \"It looks like a suburb. Affluent white communities already live in a world where the choose to fund youth, health, housing etc more than they fund police. These communities have lower crime rates not because they have more police, but bc they have more resources to support healthy society in a way that reduces crime.\n\nWhen a teenager or preteen does something harmful in a suburb (I say teen bc this is often where lifelong carceral cycles begin for Black and Brown communities), White communities bend over backwards to find alternatives to incarceration for their loved ones to \"protect their future,\" like community service or rehab or restorative measures. Why don't we treat Black and Brown people the same way? Why doesn't the criminal system care about Black teens' futures the way they care for White teens' futures? Why doesn't the news use Black people's graduation or family photos in stories the way they do when they cover White people (eg Brock Turner) who commit harmful crimes? Affluent White suburbs also design their own lives so that they walk through the world without having much interruption or interaction with police at all aside from community events and speeding tickets (and many of these communities try to reduce those, too!)\n\nJust starting THERE would be a dramatically and radically different world than what we are experiencing now.\u201d",

Tell me if you heard this story. \n\n>\tThe Mice once called a meeting to decide on a plan to free themselves of their enemy, the Cat. At least they wished to find some way of knowing when she was coming, so they might have time to run away. Indeed, something had to be done, for they lived in such constant fear of her claws that they hardly dared stir from their dens by night or day.\nMany plans were discussed, but none of them was thought good enough. At last a very young Mouse got up and said:\n\"I have a plan that seems very simple, but I know it will be successful.\nAll we have to do is to hang a bell about the Cat's neck. When we hear the bell ringing we will know immediately that our enemy is coming.\"\nAll the Mice were much surprised that they had not thought of such a plan before. But in the midst of the rejoicing over their good fortune, an old Mouse arose and said:\n\"I will say that the plan of the young Mouse is very good. But let me ask one question: Who will bell the Cat?\"\n\n\nEveryone that is saying \u201cDefund the Police!\u201d Is too busy breaking their arms about coming up with such a great plan. \n\nBut there is no follow through. So I\u2019m asking you for a follow through plan. Seattle has money the could spend after losing the officers and the money for officer recruitment: $115m. \n\nMy point is that you\u2019re stopping at out the bell on the cat. Until a concrete plan to convince city council in how those resources could be better spent to prevent crime, you all are just busy jerking each other off and patting yourselves in the back, then bemoaning when someone comes along and questions you about the rest of the plan.",

This would be the same as defunding the police, would it not? Less officers on the streets. \n\nAnd crime is increasing - did in increase by 20% in other cities too?\n\nSo can you not see how they\u2019re trying to hire more officers because there is more crime and less officers to deal with it? \n\nTell me if you heard this story. \n>q The Mice once called a meeting to decide on a plan to free themselves of their enemy, the Cat. At least they wished to find some way of knowing when she was coming, so they might have time to run away. Indeed, something had to be done, for they lived in such constant fear of her claws that they hardly dared stir from their dens by night or day.\nMany plans were discussed, but none of them was thought good enough. At last a very young Mouse got up and said:\n\"I have a plan that seems very simple, but I know it will be successful.\nAll we have to do is to hang a bell about the Cat's neck. When we hear the bell ringing we will know immediately that our enemy is coming.\"\nAll the Mice were much surprised that they had not thought of such a plan before. But in the midst of the rejoicing over their good fortune, an old Mouse arose and said:\n\"I will say that the plan of the young Mouse is very good. But let me ask one question: Who will bell the Cat?\"\n\n\nI\u2019m asking what the plan is after defunding the police. Yet you\u2019re too stupid to realize it and insist that I\u2019m regurgitating bullshit. You\u2019re too busy patting yourself on the back but you don\u2019t have a fully realized plan. \n\nSo tell me this Einstein. How would you spend that money instead? Seattle authorized $115M on a recruitment program. How should it be utilized since this is already a police force that is defunded, for all intents and purposes. \n\nLet\u2019s see this plan to reduce crime in Seattle. Because the council is having a hard time finding recruits. Why not help them out and give the \u201cdefund the police\u201d group an example of success to rally around?",

There have been SCOTUS rulings to this end. They have no legal obligation to serve or protect anyone outside of their custody. They can investigate crimes after the fact, but that\u2019s not really useful.

Provide a real alternative example on how funding would be used then it may gain more traction. \n\nNot sure if I posted this to you but hers a good story:\n\n>\tThe Mice once called a meeting to decide on a plan to free themselves of their enemy, the Cat. At least they wished to find some way of knowing when she was coming, so they might have time to run away. Indeed, something had to be done, for they lived in such constant fear of her claws that they hardly dared stir from their dens by night or day.\nMany plans were discussed, but none of them was thought good enough. At last a very young Mouse got up and said:\n\"I have a plan that seems very simple, but I know it will be successful.\nAll we have to do is to hang a bell about the Cat's neck. When we hear the bell ringing we will know immediately that our enemy is coming.\"\nAll the Mice were much surprised that they had not thought of such a plan before. But in the midst of the rejoicing over their good fortune, an old Mouse arose and said:\n\"I will say that the plan of the young Mouse is very good. But let me ask one question: Who will bell the Cat?\"\n\nDefund the police movement seems happy to stop with the \u201clet\u2019s put a bell on the cat!\u201d And that\u2019s just a rallying cry. Every time someone dies to the cat, people just parrot put a bell on that cat! Put a bell on that cat! Not realizing that people need to flesh out the entire strategy so it can be taken seriously. And if that means continuing the discussion to flesh that plan out more, then fine. But people think that just saying \u201cwhat\u2019s the problem? Put a bell on that cat!\u201d Is just enough. \n\nAnd again, Seattle would be a great example. For all intents and purpose, the police force is defunded and you have $115M to play with and come up with a strategy. Then you can really see if the plan holds water. If it doesn\u2019t, then you know that the rallying cry is a distractions and waste of time when we could be looking for other implementable solutions. And if a plan works, then great!",

The incentive for crime is poverty, and the solution to that incentive is welfare.\n\nI don't know who you think administrates welfare programs, but my guess would be Social Workers.\n\n\\> You made the statement that social workers reduce the number of crimes. Im still waiting for your source on that.\n\nDid I? I think you might be making that one up. Feel free to quote me\n\nThe fact is, you've come in here and provided 0 links, and badgered lots of people about how more police are the answer when we all agree it's not and I've provided plenty of links proving that.\n\nNext, I proved that social programs - surely a close synonym of Social Workers, at least in your simplified lexicon - are directly linked to reductions in crime.\n\nFinally, you continued to deny social programs are a better usage of money than paying the police, with literally no evidence suggesting that is true, in the face of evidence suggesting police are useless and crime is heavily associated with a lack of social safety nets.\n\nNotice how crime rates are increasing faster in USA than around the rest of the developed world during pandemic time...",

All it takes is one angry student to overpower the teachers or just distract them and get the gun. \n\nThe UK had the Dunblane Massacre and Australia had the Port Arthur massacre. Both happened in 1996. But unlike the United States, they responded with sweeping gun laws. America did the opposite, made guns easier to get and more and more and more school shootings keep happening. 19 kids just died because guns are more important to republicans.",

If anything, it's the government that needs stronger more effective regulation. Everything changing each time a new president or judge gets seated is bad for the peace. When I was a kid, you had to go to a hunter safety class (all day) and then pass a written exam and practical exam and reach your 12th birthday to get a rifle. These things are common sense. Did this kid present his hunter safety card to buy the rifle? No? Well who dropped the ball here? Was it me? No? Reasonable people get tired of re-hashing everything each time this happens. But that does not mean that the blame for this gets put on a gun, or a manufacturer, or any other crazy conclusion. And putting a pistol grip on a semi-automatic doesn't imbue it with super powers. I am sure a 10 shot lever action with tube feed would have been just as successful?? as this scenario. Hell, he could have locked himself in the room with a bat and likely would have done the same.

      "text": "I've been really surprised today about how many people are not aware that the supreme court and several state and federal courts including a Florida judge after the parkland shooting have ruled that there is no constitutional duty to protect individuals not already in police custody. Those cops and SROs are not there to protect your children they are there to police them and investigate after the fact. Google is your friend you can find several cases on this. Some are over a stabbing, some over a woman killed when the police failed to protect her from an abusive spouse, some over school shootings. But all have ruled the same. Please remember this when you see armed cops walking around your child's school they are there to police children and protect school property not your babies. Stop expecting them to. Please educate yourselves on this. They are there to smoothe the way of the public school to for profit prison pipeline. To arrest kids for doing what kids have always done. Not to stopped armed men from barreling into the school with a gun. It's gross and unjust but it is the fact of the matter. \n\nhttps://mises.org/power-market/police-have-no-duty-protect-you-federal-court-affirms-yet-again",

One was for a stabbing, one where cops failed to protect a woman from her abusive ex, and school shootings along with many more. You can Google it. Some go further back to like 2005. There is no constitutional duty to protect. It's not a bad faith argument it's true and it's happened repeatedly in this country. So if they know they don't have to and no punishment will come as a result of them not doing it on top of qualified immunity. It really is surprising how many people don't know this after all this time. Stoneman Douglas students tried to sue over just this exact thing and the case was thrown out by a federal court that was upholding a supreme court ruling. It's absolutely not bad faith it's the reality of the situation. Those SRO officers are not there to protect your children they are there to police them and protect school property. To arrest kids if need be. Not to stop armed gunmen. Google it yourself and see it's not an isolated ruling.  Also police in general not just at schools are there to protect property not people.\n\nEdit to add this link that shows this ruling going back as far as 1989. Have a read it's quite informative\nhttps://prospect.org/justice/police-have-no-duty-to-protect-the-public/",

I have been threatened over my opinion on this matter repeatedly and it's the main reason I left any platform that makes me easily identifiable. I have a very good friend who was beaten nearly to death while doing journalism regarding this very topic. Another friend who was working on it as well was ran out of town because of threats made to he and his wife. Both had asked me to join them on the project and I had been hesitant and was only providing support and I was still threatened. So yeah I'm way more careful about giving my opinion in this climate I live in a very conservative area where cops are worshiped while being under investigation by the state for tampering with evidence and stealing evidence. I'm not about all that shit anymore I'm to old for it and have a family of my own to protect. But the things I have seen and found out about while supporting those friends have me very skeptical of any police force tbh. It's better for my safety even on reddit. I mean I have already had to turn off my dms because of people threatening to find me and rape me or beat me.",

It impacts their behavior only in so much as they are required to act in accordance with the terms of their employment.\n\nIt is a job.  It used to be a job where people treated you like a hero for risking your life.  People focused on the good... So cops were willing to go out of their way and do more than the bare minimum.  Now people focus on the bad, and maybe they are right to be pissed at the cops, but there are very few people in this world who will gleefully lay down their lives for somebody who hates them.\n\nThere are a lot of people maliciously complying with the requirements of their jobs right now.  \"That's not my job!\" seems a very common sentiment.  Society has lost interest in taking pride in hard work, seeing it instead as a game for suckers to give more than you must in order to collect the check.  Work ethics are becoming non-existent as the antiwork crowd grows.\n\nSo once upon a time, some cops may have considered their job a sacred duty, but they weren't catching flak the way they do now.  They were largely considered the noble guardians you still expect them to be.  Now most people have seen too many videos and experienced too much bs from cops personally for society to still see them that way.  So that very large incentive is gone, and this is the result... Bare minimum police work from a police force that is either too afraid to act and be accused of something, or just so checked out that they will only do what they can't get away with not doing.\n\nCops are humans.  They're going to respond in the same human ways as any of the rest of us when society gives you the middle finger.  That can upset you, but we didn't arrive at this point magically.  A series of social changes brought us here.  Where there are social upheavals, you get change.  This may not be the desired change, but the cops are responding to severe changes in their work environment by rebelling.\n\nIt is a game to see which side breaks first. Cops don't want to work anymore.  People say they don't need cops and they are evil.  How are you going to motivate them to work?  Even if you could fire them for this, where are you going to get more cops? When public opinion has shifted so much that cops are seen as the opressive long arm of a corrupt government, it is gonna get hard to find new recruits.\n\nSo you can be angry and offended that they aren't fulfilling a moral obligation you feel they should embrace, honor and duty, self sacrifice... But if they're going to be viewed as oppressors and openly hated everywhere they go, what other incentive can you offer to make them willing to sacrifice their lives for society again?",

The moment you tell these asshole that they need to put up there toys they throw the biggest fit like a child who finds out he\u2019s gotta share his toy with a friend. The difference between this one and others is literal children we\u2019re gunned down one by one with a bullet the size of a small almond with a weapon he bought when he turned 18. Im done trying to debate these assholes who don\u2019t share or who use there privilege or position to better themselves or those around meanwhile the rest of us just take there scraps or what ever they decide they don\u2019t want. There will be another mass shooting we\u2019re kids like those at Robb elementary will be gunned or worse next time. My one true fear is these shooters will start getting more sophisticated and even team up together to cause maximum damage. The two at columbine had machine guns, uvalade and Buffalo had rifles and tactical protection and gear, there improving how they can cause the most damage, there learning. As much as I enjoy service to my country I hate that I have to see it implode while everyone just \u201cshares\u201d or \u201clikes\u201d whatever situation they have going on with there lives. Everyone knows what can or must be done but instead some care so strongly about a piece of paper that was written hundreds of years ago that they would rather risk the lives of there own children and others as well for the preservation of a long ago idea that serves no other purpose.",

I worked closely with a guy for the better part of 16 years, off and on. He retired and became a cop. He dropped me from all social media and won\u2019t make eye contact when we run into each other in the grocery story, all because I started asking him questions.  It all started with Walter Scott, a 50 year old man in Charleston, S.C., who was killed when he ran after a traffic stop.  He had a warrant for child support. The cop, Michael Slager, pursued Mr. Scott and shot him in the back.  He then handcuffed Scott, walked backed to what was later determined to be his Taser and dropped it next to Scott.  Slager later said Scott grabbed his Taser and felt threatened. \n\nHe kept saying I didn\u2019t know the whole story and let\u2019s just see what happens. After Slager pleaded guilty to civil rights violations, and the judge sentenced him to 20 years for what the judge called 2nd degree murder, I reengaged with him.  His response was, \u201cHe (Slager) was afraid for his life.\u201d I asked how was that possible, when Scott was running away, had no weapons, and was shot in the back from 15-20 feet away.  He stopped responding and soon after dropped me from social media.  This was a guy I knew for years, had risked his life in Iraq and Afghanistan, had been an Air Force cop, and knew that he was putting his life on the line every time he deployed.  And yet here he was making excuses for a man who had gunned down a man who was absolutely no threat.  I just don\u2019t understand.",

The issue is that they are not legally required to do so. In the SCOTUS case [Castle Rock v. Gonzales](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_of_Castle_Rock_v._Gonzales) it was held that the police have no affirmative duty to intervene to protect you. This is in reality a reasonable and practical decision lest every city, county, and state be sued into oblivion for every time a cop was not available to intervene. Where it becomes an issue is when those police who are present abdicate their moral (as opposed to legal) obligation to intervene and as we saw in Uvalde went a step further and prevented anyone else from doing so as well. It is an act of evil for the state to prevent its citizens from protecting themselves AND absolving themselves of the responsibility to do so.\n\n>Why aren\u2019t teachers provided bulletproof vests? \n\nAs a practical matter it is funding and risk assessment. While shootings such as this are tragic and devestating they are also a **statistical** non-event. When you have limited resources you need to put the money where you get the most mileage. So with a limited school budget do you buy ballistic vests or math books? As emotionally satisfying as it would be to say vests or demand the funding for both that isn't the way the world works. There is only so much money to go around and choices have to be made.\n\nIt is also worth noting, soft armor that you *might* get people to wear on a regular basis won't stop rifle rounds. Ballistic plates that will stop rifle rounds are not going to be worn with any regularity. If the argument then is keep it in the classroom then why not just provide better door locks and a ballistic blanket to go over the back of the door? Cheaper and protects the entire class.\n\n>Hell, children too!\n\nSee above.\n\n>Especially in states like Texas where guns can be bought at the dollar store.\n\nThis is not true. At least not in any practical sense. Dollar Tree/General/etc are not selling firearms in any state. There may be some fringe local discount outlet that also has their federal firearms license (FFL) and is selling off brand paper towels and guns out of the same store front. If so tbat is A. rare to the point of being a useless example and B. Irrelevent because as an FFL they still have to follow all the same rules as any other gun dealer which includes the federal background checks on sales.",

Most officers will be wearing soft body armor rated at most as NIJ level III which is rated to stop pistol rounds. This armor will do nothing to stop rifles.\n\nTo stop rifle rounds you need hard armor rated to NIJ Level IV. Whether the normal patrol officer has hard plate armor in their car is going to be department by department or possibly even officer by officer.\n\nAs a final point the statement that their job is to protect the innocent is not, from a legal point of view, true. Due to the SCOTUS decision in Castle Rock v. Gonzales the police have no legal obligation to protect any specific individual. Morally your point is taken but legally you are wrong.",

You may but not everyone reading these threads will so it was as much for them as for you.\n\n>But, did anyone actually know what he was firing until after he was killed? He theoretically could have been using a hand gun. \n\nA very valid question and not one I think has been answered definitively. Give that some officers had engaged with him in the open I am willing to give them the benefit of the doubt that they were able to clearly tell he had a rifle and not just a handgun. The visual and auditory signatures between the two is rather distinct. That said I can understand why others may be unwilling to concede that as a reasonable conclusion.\n\n>I\u2019m not sure how any armed law enforcement officer could morally stand outside and do nothing.\n\nThey can't. Thus the outrage. This isn't a question of legality because the law is clearly on the side of the Uvalde PD. It is the moral failing of those officers that is problem.\n\n>A border patrol agent shot and killed the assailant. \n\nYes, BORTAC had the fortitude to meet their moral obligations where UPD did not.\n\n>But the bottom line. It took far to long for for law enforcement to do anything\n\nNever disagreed with that assertion.",

      "text": "Back in 2014 or so, William Forstchen wrote a book titled Day of Wrath. It's about Muslim terrorists plan and then attack various schools in the U.S., along with attacks on people who are driving on the freeway. Children being raped/beheaded in school for example. VERY ugly story and plausible, considering 9-11. Nephew is a sheriff's deputy in Florida and I asked him what was their scenario for mass school shootings. He said whoever gets there first, calls dispatch to say they're there and they go in. NO waiting for backup, negotiators, etc. What bothers me is, Texas cops DON'T wear body armor as part of their every day uniform/\n\nequipment?",

Patrol officers almost certainly are wearing soft body armor which at best is going to be NIJ level III meaning it is rated to stop pistol rounds. These vests are effectively street clothes when dealing with rifle rounds.  \n\n\nWhether a patrol officer has NIJ Level IV hard plates to deal with rifle rounds is probably a department by department or possibly officer by officer question. An officer is not going to be wearing this level of protection day in or day out and if they have it at all it will be in their car.\n\nNone of that absolves the moral failure of those officers to protect innocent people in accordance with the responsibilities of the position they voluntarily took on. Adequate body armor or not if you take on those positions it is your obligation to go toward the sounds of danger.",

It is now nearly universal that the first two officers on scene begin clearing the building and seeking out the gunman. They don\u2019t wait for reinforcements or SWAT or for the gunman to surrender. \n\nI think many of us would agree that US law enforcement is in serious need of reform, even when following the rules.

Have you ever had a situation where someone else who didn't have your job try to tell you what your job was? Like imagine a customer telling a store clerk to do whatever the customer said. That's this whole fucking reddit thread. Literally just a bunch of dumb fucking Karens getting pissed off.",

It's more than a possibility that an officer \"might get hurt\". They might die. Say it. Die. That's what happened to the children.

Nothing to do with not being brave enough. It was the wrong call retrospectively, because now they know that there were still survivors inside.

I'm not even american. \n\nAmerican media is just media from a north american country. Whether its a facebook post, a tweet, a news station, a youtube video. What you just did, blaming some media for some mindset as if someone would have to be misled to reach a conclusion (because you've deemed anything that deviates from your own personal opinions as 'impossible' or 'atrocious') different from yours.

I just don't understand this logic. I mean, I get WHY people defend this logic (cuz Merica and 2nd amendment and the Bible) but how can you seriously justify AR-15s just being sold en masse? How can you not see a problem with semi auto weapons used in MOST mass shootings? The 2nd amendment only justifies US armed forces owning weapons, until the 80s when gun lobbyists, who were out to make money, duh, convinced people that owning guns was a \"right\" and coincidentally enough, the NRA collected millions and millions of dollars from gun sales/membership fees after that. Almost as if that was the ONLY goal. Fast forward 40 years and instead of limiting sales, there are more guns than the previous 30 years combined....which is why cops always \"fear for their lives\", but instead of limiting guns, these ass clowns state the only solution is MORE guns....which causes police to hesitate in shootings which causes people to put forth a \"more guns solution\"...and round and round their logic goes....",

Earlier, [shooter] had shot his grandmother in the face, severely wounding her. Law enforcement initially gave incorrect reports that the shooter was engaged before entering, but later corrected that, after firing shots outside the school for approximately 12 minutes, he entered Robb Elementary armed with a rifle and handgun without encountering any armed resistance. [Shooter]  locked himself inside a classroom, where he killed his victims over the course of an hour, before being killed by a\u00a0U.S. Border Patrol\u00a0agent. Law enforcement officials attributed the delay in breaching the room to a lack of manpower. Police first responders received widespread criticism for their handling of the shooting.\n\nThis is just 10 days after a white nationalist killed 10 black people in a New York supermarket.",

A guy throwing his life away, so that you could give his wife a medal and tell a story full of glory, heroism and self-sacrifice to recruit other would-be heroes?\n\nI don't think so. What I think is that this whole debate is a distraction. Now everyone is mad at these guys who where rightfully afraid and didn't played the role of hero society has imposed onto them. Instead of having a discussion about gun violence, now there's proxy outrage about cowardly cops. But if you could just for a moment stop searching for alternate ways this whole tragedy could've played out, 'if only the cops were brave and the doors were shut and the teachers were armed', just to keep holding onto that phantasy that there's a way to keep the guns but not the gun violence, you might realize there's only one reason this happend: It's the guns. Nothing else.\n\nThere's no way to prevent this, no cops, no doors, no armed teachers and none of all that other bullshit that get's thrown around so that you don't realize what's happening.

How often have we heard of cops shooting innocent people, with the justification that they feared for their own safety?\n\nI recall viewing body cam footage of cops who shot a suspect holding a mobile phone (it turned out he was trying to get in his own back door because he'd forgotten his key), and then hiding behind a corner from this corpse whilst waiting 40 minutes for backup. They were hyperventilating the whole time, and they were absolutely terrified.\n\nThere was also an incident, I think in a hotel in Arizona, where an officer killed a drunk man who had reached down to pull his trousers up. The officer was clearly not in control of himself or the situation, screaming at this man, who died from his wounds.\n\nAnd now we have officers refusing to go into a school to save children because they were worried about being shot. They waited for a state police SWAT team to arrive, and children died because of their inaction. They were probably following department guidelines designed to keep the police safe. But what about the children?\n\nThere is a clear pattern, across America, of police transferring risk to the general public. Be it a traffic stop, a callout, or an emergency, the safety of the public is a secondary consideration.",

Why are we giving them authority if policing is all we get with no protection? Why are we guaranteeing these legal scumbags retirement when none of us are afforded one?\n\nIt\u2019s easy being defeatist if you don\u2019t recognize the cost it incurs. If you are an American that will have to work until the day you die, you are funding these people\u2019 retirements that they earn by not protecting and serving (sometimes outright steal, beat, rape, harass, with impunity). I can\u2019t think of anything more depressing other than 1984, except we are literally living it. \n\nBut yeah, we can\u2019t find people to do better so we\u2019re stuck with it.

I don't want them to be cops either. Neither does anyone else advocating for them having the option to arm themselves. We want teachers to have the choice to take charge of their own safety rather than being forced to rely on people who may not be present or willing to intervene in the critical moment of confrontation.\n\nGiven that teaching is a profession dominated by women why are you so against women's choice in how to use their body?\n\n>How about some common sense gun laws.\n\nI am proposing common sense gun laws.

It's why only the former is expected to risk themselves to protect children as part of the job.\n\n>Also you wont like a world without police which is what would happen if you told officers they had to run into certain death\n\nReally?  What would the difference be?  I'd have to stand around outside a school *myself* doing nothing during a killing spree instead of relying on *them* for that valuable service?\n\n>Again if you arent willing to die for something it is not ok to say others have too\n\nAgain, it absolutely is if those people signed up for it.\n\n>You know what I hold you responsible for the deaths of the children in Texas. If you had been braver you could have been an officer there and died for them but you chose not to so its your fault.\n\nLeaving aside the fact that I don't live in Texas, I never agreed to be an officer.  I never looked at the job and said, \"man, I absolutely have what it takes to confront danger in the interest of the public.\"\n\nThey *did.*",

You cant say assume they ran in and use the data from them not running in, that doesnt work as an equation. Again officers day to day tasks bring them into dangerous situations that happen quickly and thats why they are armed. When a situation goes from quickly to a hostage barricade situation they bring in different officers with different equipment to handle those because normal officers are not trained or equipped to deal with them. How do I put this, if I wanted my house painted I would hire a local painting crew, but if I wanted a portrait painted I would hire an artist. Both deal with paint and paint in their own way but the artist has a whole different skill set and tools than a generic house painter.",

Running into military rifle fire without proper gear and training will get you killed way way more times than not. Statistics is how you have to look at something like this not the one off very lucky moment of the hero here. Yes he got lucky but stats tell us most people who run at military rifles die, thats why the military uses those rifles to begin with",

This was a Supreme Court ruling, and if you think those are based on what society wants then you haven't been watching the news for... ever.\n\n>So society has said they dont expect officers to charge into the fire of a military rifle\n\nCorrection: the Supreme Court has said this.  Don't confuse the Supreme Court for 'society.'\n\n>What you are going to find is that you dont have enough people who agree with you to change how society views right and wrong here\n\nHere's fun: I more or less guarantee we'll see opinion polls in the coming days about whether the police should have intervened in that hour or not.

Hell, Trump put 3 justices on the bench and he lost the popular vote.  Many of our justices were put in place by officials that the people *didn't* vote for, but the electoral college did.  If you wanna take that further, California represents over 12% of the people but only 4% of the Senators.  Pretending that these politicians are the will of the people in some grander sense requires some extreme mental acrobatics.\n\n>if I hold a gun to your head and say I am not going to hurt you what do you believe, what I said or my actions?\n\nAt this point I'd have no idea, because you clearly aren't spending a lot of time in reality.",

'Voter suppression' would like to have a word with you.\n\nIf you think that everything elected officials do necessarily represents the will of the voters then you have a lot - a LOT - to learn about how politics work, especially in first-past-the-post voting systems.  And especially in today's hyper-polarized environment.  You don't get to accuse me of naivete when you're insisting politicians all reflect the will of the voters.",

Officers sign up to arrest members of the public who commit crimes. Its the same reason if you pull a gun on an officer he can kill you, he isnt and never was required or signed up to die. Now officers know that part of their job is dangerous and they can die but that doesnt mean any of them signed up to die. Perhaps that will help. Also of course I dont actually hold you responsible but the point was that you are throwing blame for not being willing to die when you arent. It is a simple thing, if you arent willing to die for something you have no right to ask anyone else too.",

I am very consistent on this and dont think a draft should ever be done again in any circumstances. Also lots of soldiers around the world in wars are forced in, a good example currently are the Russian soldiers who are conscripts not fighting because they want too.

They sit outside and wait while truly innocent people are massacred. People who join law enforcement know what they signed up for. They don\u2019t get a fucking pass here.\n\nSo fuck you for even suggesting that the police were right here. You are an absolutely vile human being. Just, fuck you",

Even while they are murdering black people in the streets, the thin blue line flag appears and we are told we need to back the blue. We are told they have dangerous jobs and we need to respect them for facing danger.\n\nThen we see children being murdered at Parkland with a police officer present who didn\u2019t run in. At Uvalde, where cops are standing around outside, cuffing parents, threatening them with tasers while they can hear the gunshots that are murdering their BABIES.\n\nAnd then the lies and changing narrative that has surrounded Uvalde\u2026\n\nOf course there is gonna be some hesitation. I think any normal human being would. The fact remains is that they signed up for a job that requires them to run into danger to save people. They have been revered above all other occupations for decades. And yet, here we are.\n\nAnd no, this is not a place for a \u201crational\u201d conversation because nothing going on is fucking rational",

It sounds like a horrible thing to say, but I\u2019m fairly confident the shooter had shot and killed every child in that room before the cops even arrived, and those cops likely knew this. I don\u2019t know for sure, but it is indeed pretty heavy speculation to suggest that the cops chose to just hang out outside out of cowardice while they heard more and more kids getting shot. If this actually WAS the case, then those are shitty cops that let several children die. But I need definitive evidence that this was actually the case, because it\u2019s most certainly a balancing act. \n\nAlso, \u201cless bullets for the kids\u201d is really a strange argument; making the shooter waste a minuscule amount of ammo compared to what he had for the sole purpose of buying like 5 more seconds when again it\u2019s much more likely than not that the shooter had already shot all the kids in that class? \n\nIt\u2019s a horrifying situation for those kids in there, especially that one girl who bled out in there all that time, I know. But I think holding the cops responsible for all 19 kids\u2019 lives lost without definitive proof that they just chose to wait for the shooter to kill all 19 in front of them (as opposed to arriving at the scene with the shooter having shot most of the class already) is disingenuous. \n\nThat being said, it\u2019s very understandable why people are upset about this decision.",

They make vastly more than nearly every other civil employee, get protections from society no other profession enjoys, live in a country where half of the nation hero worships them with flags and pins and blue line bumper stickers. They have a job that is statistically less dangerous than delivery drivers, farmers, and even crossing guards despite the media fixation on sensationalizing their occupational risks (as policing is only the 22nd most dangerous job in America). And to top it off they have legions of apologists and sycophants like you who defend every fuck up they make. \n\nWhen half the cars in Texas have blue line stickers, and when Texan cities give almost half of their budget to making these cosplaying cowards very well compensated, how the fuck is society against them? It isn't.\n\nWhat you're trying to do, because you have the same disgusting lack of moral fiber as these police in question, is divert blame to every American who has protested against police misconduct. \n\n\"Why should they stop kids from being murdered when some people were mean to them? I wouldn't!\"\n\nPathetic.",

Pretty easy to sit back on reddit and call them lazy mfs but if you were in the same situation you would do exactly what they did, no question. \n\nAnother thing, typical beat cops are not trained sufficiently to handle active shooter situations like that and if they did go in it\u2019s almost guaranteed that more children would have been caught in the crossfire. \n\nAnd im also 1000% certain youd still call me a \u201cboot licking piece of shit\u201d if i said the kids caught in the crossfire were avoidable casualties if the officers didn\u2019t go in. Either way you\u2019d bitch and moan atleast this way the cops dont have children\u2019s blood on their hands and bullets in their bodies. \n\nBlaming the cops for this situation instead of your fucked up excuse for a political system is why this shit keeps happening.",

I wonder how you would react when it affected you. Stricter gun control could have prevented this, but Americans LOOOOOOVE their guns and I've already seen many posts saying that even if all the kids died in shootings, they still won't accept stricter gun laws.

They were keeping parents back yes.  They were probably not too nice about it either to say the least.  But saying that no law enforcement went in to the school is false.  Swat did respond to the shooting in a reasonable time.  The shooter had barricaded himself in a class room when swat arrived.\n\nNow why didn\u2019t they go in after him?  Bottlenecking.  Meaning basically he was in a position where if they entered he would have the advantage as swat would have to funnel while he is able to position and protect himself.  Not to mention if he had hostages just busting in would result in more casualties.\n\nWhat happened was beyond awful and we need to do something regarding our gun laws.

Why does the police don't have some protective gear in their cars, ready for these things since a lot of people have guns?\n3. Did dispatch send a swat team directly to save time?\n\nThis is a really hard situation to be responsible for. As higher ranking officer (I am guessing here, please correct me if I am wrong) you are responsible for the safety of your lower ranking officers. Sending them in to a shooter is a tough choice and goes against the responsibility of work being carried out safely. It's the same choice for firefighters that don't enter certain situations where their own life is at high risk.\n\nI know it is children, it's a tough call. Be mad but think it through from the perspective of being responsible for the safety of your employees. (because policemen are also employed).\n\nI am more mad at the root cause of the issue. Why could the shooter easily get a gun and why could he just walk into a school?",

Police should keep the peace and the military should be responding to gunmen.  Police should just be there to deescalate situations.\n\nI for one can sympathize because I don't want to get shot either.  I also don't want to shoot anyone though. And I think our police culture unfortunately promotes the latter.\n\nWe have given our police military style gear but not military style training. So they get the power over others but don't have the military discipline. \n\nThe gunman scared them and took away their power. So they couldn't act.  \n\nOn one side I don't want to beat them up because admitting that you don't want to get shot seems healthy and is probably what real police should feel. On the other hand since in America we give police the equipment and power to shoot people just like the military then they should take the responsibility and consequences that come with that.",

      "text": "So as someone in law enforcement I have so many feelings about this. \n\nFirst, on its surface it\u2019s funny. Big bad Texas cops are afraid to do their job. It made the whole station laugh when we heard it. \n\nSecond, reports say that they gave parents all kinds of excuses why they weren\u2019t going in which feels kind of like the worst part. Just own up to it, don\u2019t try and bullshit people. \n\nThird, this approach goes against everything I\u2019ve been taught and trained. Ever since Columbine it\u2019s been SOP for basically every agency in America to go into an active shooter scene and attempt to stop the killing ASAP. It\u2019s beyond frustrating to see this. \n\nThis seems like a lack of training and preparedness. Course, if we were taking larger steps to keep this from happening again it would be much less of an issue. \n\nThanks for coming to my TedTalk. Fuck it all.",

      "text": "Something lost on Americans is that police aren\u2019t there to protect individuals. We Americans refuse to break with the glamorized TV-induced concept that mythologizes the role of the police in society. Besides, standard police practice is to prevent a hail of gun fire to protect as many lives as possible, including themselves. The only police that went into that school were those who had children in the school. \n\nLet\u2019s get real, America\u2019s police exist to protect the color line. Policing isn\u2019t even the most dangerous job in the USA; the coronavirus killed more cops in the last two years. Police only solve about 2% crimes which flies in the face of what we see in the movies or on those crime TV showed where cops appear to have a success rate of over 90%. \n\nWhat\u2019s also interesting is what incites the conversation around gun violence when most of the killing with guns is going on elsewhere and not in schools. Not to belittle the heartless killing in the school, but true structural reform does not happen , in part, because Americans keep reinforcing many false tropes about gun violence in America that frame it as a mere political issue when in reality it comes down to addressing it as a [public health](https://www.aafp.org/about/policies/all/gun-violence.html) matter. [Media reporting](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/otm/segments/how-report-gun-violence-america-on-the-media) on gun violence in America is also hurting us as it keeps us from focusing on reforming what really needs.",

Me and my division, most of whom weren't on duty section and therefore had no duty at the time to respond, flew to the armory and security force issue to get armed up. We were armed and in full battle rattle in mere minutes, as is expected.  Our ATTWO came over our radio and told us the other ships ATTWO was requesting a team from our ship to detach and sweep their ship (because we were ready and already had teams on station topside before they did, same thing happened once when another ship called away a fire on board across the pier from us, our people were dressed out and ready to go before the actual ship that called away the emergency). He asked for volunteers and I'll be damned if every one of my guys didn't put their hands up before he even finished his sentence. I was so incredibly proud of them. \n\nWe egressed our ship, swept across the pier and by direction of the other ships OOD entered their vessel and moved as a unit to the reported location of the gun shots. We entered the space and evaluated the situation, and in the end it turned out to be a case of negligent discharge by the internal rover and one of his friends who had been \"trying to show him something\". No injuries or fatalities in the end but we didn't know that until the very end. \n\nMy guys volunteered to go into a situation where they believed they'd be in harms way but they did it because they thought the lives of other sailors, some of whom were their friends, might be in danger. \n\nIt's what we were trained for and it's what these cops were trained for. And the cops have spent far more time and effort training for something like this because law enforcement is their whole job. Not so with my sailors. So yeah. Fuck these cops",

Every time a controversial decision is made in the public sphere, armchair juries make judgments both ways, particularly criticisms. When they\u2019re wrong, it fades away like their meaningless opinions should, but when they\u2019re right it gets presented as being immediately obvious. I don\u2019t disagree that it would appear that they made the wrong decision, but there commander didn\u2019t have the benefit of judging it from after the fact. It may still turn out that their immediate decision was still a bad one, but this wasn\u2019t like a decision over which shoes to wear, it was a high pressure and high stakes decision and people fuck up.",

He had more information than anyone else and everyone else knew kids were being shot inside while he kept everyone out.\n2. If you fuck up this badly in high pressure situations you shouldn't be allowed to be an officer, much less a commander. Stress is not a valid excuse for this level of incompetence. Some jobs are just too important for incompetent people to have that job. It's no different than a lifeguard who can't swim; they shouldn't have their job.",

At that point in time, none of that information was publicly available.  \n  \nInsofar as doing the wrong thing, they\u2019ve since ticked every box I allowed for in my disclaimer, so I agree it was gross negligence on their part.  \n  \nI still stand by what I said though, because the more general point I was trying to make is that people shouldn\u2019t be so quick to judge. There are circumstances where this would have been the right call and whilst they\u2019re deserving of condemnation, that condemnation began before it was actually known that they\u2019d behaved in a manner worthy of condemnation.  \n  \nSo to answer your question m, that is why I commented. People should be given the benefit of the doubt before that doubt is removed.  \n  \nAs for the rest:  \n  \n1. \u201cEveryone\u201d (in inverted commas because I don\u2019t like to speak in absolutes like that) \u201c*thought*\u201d kids were being shot inside whilst they remained outside.  \n2. I partially agree with that. If you\u2019re incompetent at doing your job, you shouldn\u2019t be doing it. However, what if they did go in and the officers were killed, along with the kids? That\u2019d be a bigger tragedy or what if going in prompted the gun man killed the kids because they went in? Or what if the kids were caught in the crossfire? How would anyone outside the building know if all the kids were shot or were going to be?  \n  \n\nKeep in mind that my original comment was made a few hours after this post, so this discussion (at least on my part) excludes any knowledge gained since the post was made.",

That cops aren't there for situations like that? So, in your world, who is it you think we should call in a situation like that? The dog catcher? A dentist? Maybe a librarian?\n\nIt's the police. The police are the people you call for that shit. And why do you call the police in that situation? It's because they are supposed to handle it.\n\nIf you become a police officer, you're supposed to know it can be dangerous, and you're supposed to then do your job. If you're a coward, you're not supposed to sign up for a job where being a coward is the opposite of your job.\n\nAre you even listening to yourself? I wonder, is there anything you wouldn't defend the police for?

What do you think will people prioritise? Their psychology or their role in society? \nAnother huge factor in decision making is emotional attachment. The police probably don't even know these people. They are strangers. Compare that with a country that takes in refugees. Countries are reluctant to take in refugees from the other side of the globe, while neighboring countries are probably very happy to help. Simply because there exists a connection.\nYou know what role in society has the highest emotional connection with kids? Teachers. They are much more likely to protect their students than any officer will. And in this case psychology aligns with duty.\n\nI probably have nothing more to say, but I will read your replies.",

If you aren't willing to go in the burning building then don't be a fire fighter.\n\nAny number of other dangerous professions (mining, commercial fishing, etc etc etc) again have the same explicit exchange of money for risk of life and limb in the performance of a task.

One is of course cowardice. Two is that they were scared to have been shot by their own teams already in the school, which if you don't have clear communication during an inter agency incident then that could very well happen. And three is the gunman was already barricaded and in my experience school doors can be extremely hard to breach without special equipment so bum rushing a barricaded subject would be pointless loss of life. Just sit and wait because the barricaded intruder can't go anywhere without going into your line of fire.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: It was the 3rd one. Police didn't do nothing on the scene, they had inner cordon set up around the barricaded classroom and outer cordon keeping people out of the active shooter site while waiting for a team to breach the school door.
