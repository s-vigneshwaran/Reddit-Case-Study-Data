  "text": "TIFU learning sign language\n[Update.](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/vzli1b/tifu_learning_sign_language_update)\n\nThrowaway account.\n\nMy mom's been involved with this new guy for a few months now. To be fair, enough time has passed for me to stop referring to him as the new guy, but he's not my dad and I guess that will always make him feel like the new guy. According to movie logic, I'm supposed to hate him for trying to replace my father or whatever, but the truth is, I like him. I like him so much that I've been learning how to use sign language to improve our communication because new guy happens to be Deaf. \n\nHe can read lips, which is how I've been communicating with him. My mom didn't waste any time learning sign language at the beginning of their romance and she's at the point now where she can have full conversations without using her voice. I was really proud of her and so was new guy. I'm not on their level yet, but I've had enough practice to follow a conversation that's not too complicated. My plan was to surprise new guy on his birthday, which is 2 months from now, and wish him a happy birthday as well as officially welcoming him to the family in sign language. \n\nHowever, I never factored in the amount of dirty talk my mom and new guy were having in sign language. Not knowing that I can understand them, my mom and new guy have gotten disturbingly comfortable exposing their sex life in my company. It didn't matter if we were at the dinner table or watching tv, I would constantly catch so many dirty descriptions being communicated between the two of them. They are worse than horny teenagers, and I should know, I am one. No 17 year old son should ever witness his mother use her fingers to demonstrate how wet her vagina is. \n\nIt's gotten to the point where I'm no longer willing to wait until new guy's birthday to make it known that I can understand sign language because HOLY FUCK I need my eyes to not see this shit anymore. \n\nThis is an ongoing fuck up.\n\n**Tl:dr The guy my mom's dating is Deaf. Because I like the dude, I decided to learn sign language in secret and was planning to surprise him on his upcoming birthday by communicating in sign language. Little did I know that secretly understanding sign language would expose me to disturbingly intimate conversations between my mom and the new man in her life.**",

He has loads of sign language videos. \n\nIf you *really* want to immerse yourself in dirty ASL slang, find out where your local deaf community meets and ask to join because you're interested in learning sign language. Many Deaf communities do a Deaf Happy Hour once a month at various locations. By the end of the night, you could leave there having learned a bunch of dirty signs. \n\nThere is also an organization called [Deaf Coffee](https://deafcoffee.com/) that is more low-key and less boozy and you can find coffee shops where Deaf people hang out, drink coffee, and chat. \n\nBut one thing to remember: please be respectful and if they're not interested in helping you, accept it. Friendliness varies depending on location, but for the most part, Deaf people are happy to help you learn to communicate with them.",

Same goes for poop, bathroom, beer, fuck/sex, etc. just make a friend who knows ASL and that\u2019s what they will teach you. \n\nIf you\u2019re taking a course, you\u2019ll learn all that by second or third semester. \n\n[On YouTube there\u2019s a million sign language videos with that category of terminology.](https://i.imgur.com/zonUxWG.jpg) Our brain has evolved to prioritize learning that kind of language. The Romans developed memorization techniques using body parts and filthy imagery because our brain remembers it more vividly than anything else. \n\nPenis and vagina are part of all language and are in middle school, highschool and university text books because it\u2019s biology. Everyone has a penis or vagina and it should be among the first things you learn to say or sign in any language.\n\nEdit: the way you phrased it, you challenge the notion that OP learned how to say, \u201cwet vagina.\u201d But the way language acquisition works, in the case of ASL, is OP learned how to sign \u201chot, dry, wet, rain, cloud, storm, tree, wind\u201d\u2026common weather terms. So a beginner of course can sign \u201cwet vagina\u201d just like one could sign \u201cwet tree\u201d or \u201cwet rock\u201d or \u201cwet floor.\u201d You put the two signs together, similar to how you put two English words together, but in reverse: noun + adjective. So in ASL it would be vagina + wet. So you can see there\u2019s no reason OP wouldn\u2019t understand his mom\u2019s flirtations, even as a beginner.",

I've also worked with the three sign language performers at this year's SuperBowl. I don't interpret myself, but I advocate for accessibility at live music events quite a lot - meaning I do most of the work to arrange quality interpreters for live music events when the venues have no clue what to do... which is most of them.",

For people who have a strong attachment to being deaf this will probably make them upset and they might even refuse more advanced hearing aids fearing their culture disappearing, but let's look on the bright side people will have a choice and that is beautiful and miraculous. \n\nMy brother is visually impaired he isn't fully blind but he has no vision in one eye and can see very good out of the other with corrective lenses. \n\nHonestly I wait & pray for a day that he has a choice. The lense on one of his eyes is fully damaged along with significant trauma to the eye lid and eye muscles. I don't know when they will discover a way to either rebuild the damaged parts or grow them from stem cells. Perhaps they could find a way to replace the eye with robotics idk. He doesn't know braille yet(newly visually impaired) but reading can occasionally strain the one remaining eye so he might learn, but if you told me they had a way to fix him tomorrow I would cry and cry and laugh and dance and be so happy. I wouldn't care that braille might die. Fuck braille. \n \nI know being deaf is different then blind but having the option of  fixing a disability is the best option and if the culture dies it dies. \n\nPlus sign language might live on in industries or jobs where full hearing protection is needed or when doing underwater work.",

They think anyone who can sign at all is good enough or they assume any interpreter is capable of any genre of music or that they know where to place the interpreter, etc. They know NOTHING 99% percent of the time.\n\nBut more upsetting, they often pretend that they DO know things they clearly don't know and get it all wrong and refuse to listen to accessibility expects who try to educate them or they just flat out treat this need for accessibility as a nuisance they can't be bothered to give a damn about because they refuse to understand that the better the accessibility, the more people who could not enjoy their concerts will now buy tickets for those events. This is a widespread problem that also includes courtrooms, hospitals, police, and political events and announcements, which is why we occasionally see news stories about city authorities or political events where we find out about some random schmuck who barely signs, if at all, whom they found the moment of some important speech or announcement and assumed that was \"good enough\" (ie. the \"interpreter\" at Nelson Mandela's funeral).",

Learning sign, but I'm not that great at it and sometimes I lose that ability too when I'm already overwhelmed. It may be a bit of an overkill, but I have a 60% mechanical keyboard that I carry with me along with the My Voice TTS Android app; it's come in handy on several occasions. I type pretty fast and that way I don't have to move the phone around and wait for someone to read everything.\n\nYou can go even smaller with a 40% or even a folding keyboard, but I find those much more difficult to type on and speed and accuracy are pretty important to have when you need it.\n\nEdit: One of the reasons why I like that app is because you can add and organize words and phrases you'll commonly need, that way it's just a few taps to tell someone something like \"I can hear you but I can't speak because I'm about to have a meltdown, please let me go somewhere quiet away from people until I get my voice back, thank you. Yes I'm okay. No I don't need an ambulance. Yes I'm okay. Here's my partner's phone number if you're concerned.\"   \n\nThe above would only take me 3 taps to open the app and get to the \"meltdown phrases\" category, then 5 taps to say everything in those sentences.\n\nI know my use case might not be the same as yours, but it's been helpful enough that I feel like it's good information to share, you know?",

I try to keep things low-key and fortunately people in my life know what's up and that sometimes I just can't speak so I'll type instead, or to let me just step aside and collect myself if need be because the last thing I want in that situation is attention. But if I'm in a crowd or something, or in a building where I can't just easily walk away, it's been helpful to have a way to let people know I'm ok, I don't need help, I just need some space and I'll be fine, and for god's sake please stop touching me. And if it's already an iffy day, I can use TTS the whole time so that things don't get weird if I'm able to speak one moment but not the next. Easier to normalize things that way.\n\nI like to think it's at least made me more aware of what kind of help is actually useful or when it's actually needed, though. Like, it's great to want to do the right thing, but it's important to read the situation. If you think someone needs help and they say they're fine or don't want help, believe them. Something that's an unusual situation for you may be a normal situation for them so let them take the lead on that.\n\nI used to always worry about hurting someone's feelings if I needed to tell them to stop \"helping\" me but I eventually realized that either A) they were genuinely trying to help, in which case they would appreciate the instruction, or B) they just wanted to look good or feel good about themselves for being sUcH a GoOd PeRsOn in which case I probably shouldn't care so much about what they think haha",

                          "text": "Well, first thing I should clarify is that I was late-deafened at age twelve, so I'm an oral deaf - I can speak just fine, but I can't hear. I can also sign ASL. And sometimes we oral deaf folks will simply choose not to talk because hearing people will often rely too much on their assumptions of our lip-reading capabilities or ignore that we might still prefer that they write or type out their information to us to make sure we don't miss vital details. Making us do all the work in communication by lip-reading without meeting us halfway is one-sided, mentally exhausting, and stressful. Approaching someone right away in writing psychologically signals them (I call it a \"mental hack\") to do the same for us in return without making a fuss.\n\nThat said, upon finding my gate, I usually write out whatever I need to ask to a gate or boarding attendant and I start with telling them I'm deaf right from jump and that if I sit somewhere I can see them when it's time to board the plane, will they please give me a wave when it's time for pre-boarding. Pre-boarding is important for us as we don't want to be crammed in the boarding line and on the plane with someone cranky who gets worse or violent when we don't respond to them barking at us for ignoring their sense of entitlement. Once boarded, I just take a seat and pay attention to attendants, the clock, and the plane boarding/de-boarding process. This usually works just fine and often the gate attendant will let a flight attendant know about me and they'll direct me to my seat and point out an passenger emergency card. Sometimes they don't want us sitting in the aisles with the emergency exits; I get it, it's whatever, and if they move me to a different seat, I cooperate and let them handle the logistics. \n\nSo basically, even though I can speak, I shut up and I write out everything to every airline/airport staff I see whom I think can give me whatever info I need, be polite, and hope they'll cooperate with clear written info in return, which is usually the case. I fly a fair amount and this usually works for me, but I understand first-time deaf flyers can be nervous, especially in a busy airport. There are two kinds of deaf flyers - those who keep their head on a swivel going hard on our heightened situational awareness, and the relaxed kind who know where they need to be and what to expect, but they've probably got their situational awareness on high alert too observing the demeanor of other passengers and the attentions of the attendants in case we have to react. Hearing people mistakenly presume we're oblivious to danger; no the hell we are not. We may see or even feel it before others hear it. Our heightened situational awareness is no joke; we pay attention and we read body language like a pop-up book.\n\nTL;DR - Writing things out is really the clearest way to ensure mutal communication. And clear visual universal indicators (arrows, simple icons, etc) are helpful for any person who exclusively uses sign language or doesn't speak verbally or speaks a foreign language, for that matter.",

I mean yes I understand ultimately they should know, but if they are saying things OP shouldn't hear around him just because he can't understand, id say it's their fault. I'd say the same thing if it was two parents speaking a language they didn't think their child understood. Having a conversation is much more than just two bags of skin making sound at each other(unless drunk), there's emotions involved, and that can most definitely spill out to the people around even though they don't understand. Why should the fact that they don't understand remove their consent to be around when such a conversation is taking place? Whether I understand or not, I don't wanna be around when two people are having a heated argument, and if you decide to be rude and have that argument next to me instead of in private, you can't really get upset when I actually understand what you're saying.",

I for one, would not want to eat at the dinner table if I had found out my parents were having such discussions around me constantly, and OP should have been given that choice whether he understood or not.

The programs aren't really intended for students, but thanks to my relatively under the radar attitude and acceptable grades, the school allowed me to intend one of the entry level sign language courses on a regular basis. The words on their own are easy enough to get a grip on, but constructing sentences and conversations are a lot more challenging. It's been months of learning sign language and I'm still as green as they come, but I'm more than capable of isolating some of the words in a basic sentence or conversation and kind of connect the dots where I can. Most of the time I struggle to understand new guy when I watch him communicate. But my mom on the other hand, she's not that advanced yet, and her sign language is much slower and more basic, so it's easier for me to understand what she says... unfortunately lol.",

They're using you for excitement in the bedroom dude, that's awful. You should very obviously exclaim that you know what they're doing and that it's disgusting and needs to stop. If this was an English speaking child and parents who spoke Chinese would talked super dirty around their children, it'd be seen as depraved and nasty, idk why this is any different.",

I\u2019m just going to say this just to get it off my chest, and I don\u2019t want you to be mad or embarrassed ya\u2019know? you had no idea, but\u2026\u201d then sign (ME UNDERSTAND YOU)\n\n(I\u2019m assuming American Sign Language, but if it\u2019s not ASL, then whatever the equivalent is for your version)\n\nBy no means is this perfect. Even then, I grew up around a sense of humor that would make this whole situation just an \u201coops\u201d moment and we\u2019d just laugh it off.\n\nI do think it\u2019s at least important that you tell at least one of them that you can understand them.  It\u2019s going to come out eventually, better to just be upfront with it instead of them finding out themselves. It\u2019s very hard to pretend to not know a language. Trust me, most people would mistake me for \u201cun pinche gringo.\u201d (Their words, not mine)",

Keep it extremely simple.\n\nYou want them to think you've only just started learning, and that you can't understand their conversations YET, but you might be able to soon. They will realise they need to tone down their talk in your presence and it will probably just stop. They won't realise you ever knew.\n\nTo really drive the message home, wait a few days and then show them something a LITTLE bit more advanced. Like \"hello my name is X and I am Y years old\". They'll see you're serious and that you are learning rapidly and they'll definitely know its time to stop NOW if they have any sense.\n\nGood luck!",
