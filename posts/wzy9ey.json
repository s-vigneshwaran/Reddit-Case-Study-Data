Why people were trying to get it normalized. \n\nNow i get it. It's not girls. It's not boys. It's children. They are easy to manipulate. Girls are told to get a cool 18 yr old bf so when the 25yr substitute teacher tries to groom her, she'll think it's normal and all the cool girlz do it.\nBoys are told that wanting to do your 30 yr old female gym teacher is normal because hormones and she is hot so when the gym teacher does Rey to force herself onto him, he'll think that he is lucky and that any guy would kill to be in his place.\n\nIt's sick and gross and needs to stop.",

We like this! HORMONES DO YOUR THING!\" While the brain tries to stop it. But, as like shown in puberty, hormones trump everything. Women can orgasm, and get super wet. Its why some people think women like it, because the body obviously \"wants it\" since its getting ready, despite what the person feels.\n\nI feel like it's rhe same with men, where hormones say \"Oh touching! BLOOD FLOW AND HORMONES GO\" while the person doesn't want it themselves. \nAgain, woman, have no idea. Im taking from what I've heard from men. \ud83d\ude05 but if im wrong by all means let me know!

It would be helpful if the language we used to describe these things accounted for that. It doesn't detract from the wrongness or what some of these female teachers have done. But I would agree with the author, that most of these are nowhere the same thing as forcibly raping a girl. The comparable action would be a grown man raping a boy by force. And so a consensual relationship between a female student and male teacher, that would be considered nonconsensual because of the age difference is comparable to an identical relationship between a boy and a male teacher. But both or those are wildly different from forcible rape. In the past, our language accommodated that difference \n\nI also think there could be some admission that lots of guys would voluntarily bone their female teachers, as teenagers, if they had a hot teacher in their school, but that doesn't detract from the fact that other guys would not. Honestly, I would have boned a hot teacher, if we had one. It doesn't diminish the wrongness of what they did. Other guys might do it and later realize it was a terrible mistake, and she took advantage of them. It doesn't diminish their victimization it another wouldn't mind. Both things can be true.\n\nIt's the outrageous privilege women exercise that bothers me. We aren't paying these hoes to exploit the kids. They're supposed to be teaching.",
