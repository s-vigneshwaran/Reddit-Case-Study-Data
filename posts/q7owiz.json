This is actually one of the easiest and most reliable ways to track a device, by pinging it via other nearby devices, such as your car, whether it's off or not.\n\nWhat I told you earlier was how it was explained to me by a high-tech crime unit detective a few years back, which may not be the most accurate way of explaining it, since neither of us was an engineer. However, I have personally forwarded requests to ping phones that have been offline for over 48 hours several times in the course of my job. I can assure you that not only is it possible, it is fairly routine for law enforcement to do this to your phone.\n\nNote that this isn't like Hollywood where it will give you a perfect location for the phone, usually it's a fairly large radius which gets triangulated either from towers or nearby devices that have detected your phone via wifi or bluetooth pings. It can easily be as large as a kilometer. If your phone is pulling GPS or regular data they'll just go through towers instead or even satellite, which is much more reliable. However, it's certainly doable even without any data, so long as they have some info such as your MAC.",
