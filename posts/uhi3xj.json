And for some reason, a significant part of those get jobs in either the sales or purchasing departments. I have yet to meet a female production engineer who works with actual production setup and optimisation. \n\nThe handful of female coworkers I have in my department have barely scratched the surface when it comes to understanding what I do. Every time we hire a new female graduate engineer, I start an internal countdown to when she'll transition into some sort of administrative role. So far, I've been right every single time. \n\nIt can be simplified down to this:\n\nYou will almost never encounter a female engineer in fields and jobs that requires high level math, such as calculus, linear algebra and numerical modelling, and its use in solving physics based problems. \n\nIf men disappeared, yet they were still able to have babies (somehow), the global communications infrastructure would start falling apart when the satellites either malfunction, or their orbit get too low. It's not that there are no women in the fields required, it's that there are nowhere near enough of them. How many production facilities that can design and produce a communications satellite are there total in the world? And if you take all the women directly involved in the design and manufacture and pooled them together, would there be enough to design and manufacture just a single satellite? And even if there were, how long before they run out of materials and parts? Where do you get new electronics components? Where do you get the steel and aluminium to build it? Where does the rocket fuel come from.\n\nThe notion that men and women are equal is ridiculous. We are not. Men are naturally good at some things, and women likewise. But rather that admit that, they insist that we are 100% equal and that nothing would change if men disappeared.",
