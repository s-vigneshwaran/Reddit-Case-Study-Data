Since the graphs are mostly done with a logarithmic scale, they can look a little funky. They\u2019re showing percentage change and not actual change, which can make those spikes look more dramatic.\n\nEdit 2: The graph right above the one you used to cherry-pick your understanding of this paper shows that gun homicides decreased at a solid rate, while non-firearms homicides maintained relative consistency over time. So this not only worked, but you\u2019re reading this paper as a reason to say that they shouldn\u2019t have passed this law? Even with a source YOU PICKED, it\u2019s only supporting the claims made by gun law reformers; it works. The problem with laws like these or any that aims to challenge a problem is that if it works, people don\u2019t really see it working but as soon as it fails once, then people think I t\u2019s suddenly doing the opposite of what it is supposed to do.",

It\u2019s basically saying \u201cthere is a change and we can see the change in the numbers, but how much of that is because of the law?\u201d. They said that ALL inflection points for gun deaths happened in 1996, but the problem is that this process occurred halfway through the year and went into the next, so even though the graph shows a positive change, they\u2019re not sure if it\u2019s JUST because of the law, or because of public perception of guns. For suicides, it even says that we can\u2019t assume that the law is what caused a reduction in gun suicides, but IT DID HAPPEN. This is said about this problem by RAND: \n\u201cEmpirical research on the causal effects of firearm availability on the risk of suicide is consistent with the claim that firearms increase suicide risk, but this research cannot yet rule out some other explanations for observed associations between guns and suicide.\u201d\nYou\u2019re trying so hard to prove yourself right that you\u2019re skipping some very important words and phrasing. They\u2019re not saying that the NFA didn\u2019t do anything, they\u2019re saying that we don\u2019t know how much it did because there are so many factors. But in reality, there were fewer firearm suicides and homicides in the years following the law change.",

We average over 100 people/day dying by gun, yet such deaths don\u2019t even cause a ripple in our collective attention. It takes children being shot in a classroom to grab our attention.

This has been a deliberate, profit driven choice by the gun lobby and it comes at the expense of 100+ of our countrymen dying every day. Think about it: not one tyrant overthrown but about a million of our neighbors, co-workers, friends, parents, children have died in the past 30 years (roughly the tragedy at Columbine when NRA began its current poisoning of our country). Certainly the amount of tragedy that has ensued should give all rational gun rights activists pause and be seeking real solutions (that every other wealthy democratic country has figured out, btw). Ryan Busse, an ex-gun manufacturer executive, in book \u201cGunfight\u201d details the process the gun lobby engaged in since Columbine. He was an eye witness and participant in these decisions, so a very good source.

The problem the US faces is that there seems to me more and more mass shootings and school shootings with every passing year and nobody in position of power is doing anything about it. There was a national tragedy and Australia did something, Canada, New Zealand, Norway etc\u2026 all are doing something about a problem, I may not agree with what the Canadian government is doing but I can get behind willingness to make changes as opposed to watching children be slaughtered on a weekly basis and doing absolutely nothing about it other than \u201cthought and prayers\u201d. \n\nThe US isn\u2019t going to solve this problem by copying any one country to the letter, they can solve this problem by seeing how other countries have solved this and picking what works in the us and what doesn\u2019t. Look at the \u201csolutions\u201d that some people are coming up with, none of them will solve the problem just create a whole host of other problems while ignoring the gun problem.",

I was just a kid watching the events unfold from homeroom.  And at the time the adults around me talked about how terrible it was, but they did nothing about it.  \n\nThen the next shooting happened.  I was still a kid.  But this time we didn't spend all day in homeroom watching the news.  And the adults around me did nothing about it.\n\nLater, while I was still in junior high, my school got a tip off that someone was going to bring pipe bombs to school.  They evacuated the school, arrested the kid, and still the adults around me did nothing about it.\n\nWhen I was in high school there were two different times where we ended up either evacing or in lockdown due to threats against the school.  The only thing that changed is that the school started telling students that they had to leave their firearms at home after going hunting for the weekend.  But still, the adults around me did nothing about it.\n\nI'm now 37.\n\nFor my entire life shootings like this have been common.  Common enough that 20 years ago, while I was still a kid, I was evaced from school more than once.  Common enough that we had to put our lockdown drills into practice *more than once*.\n\nThis has been my entire life.  The adults that were around me then are still making sure that nothing is done about it now.\n\nSo of course that's how I react when I hear about the next shooting.  That's what I grew up with.  That's the life I knew.  Mass shooting are going to happen, they'll sometimes target children, and that no one is going to try and help stop it.\n\nI'll try and do what I can, but there's a reason why I don't think anything will ever change.  Because over the course of my entire life, the adults only ever dug their heels in.",

I was also a junior in high school when Columbine happened, and the next week appeared on a 22-person \"hit list\" left in a bathroom. My entire high school life and adulthood like yours has spanned the Mass Shooting Era. It's been going on so long, everyone age 40 and younger has grown up in the same sick reality.\n\nI hope you don't rely on random dude on Internet to \"better have fucking answers.\" What you do or don't do is your call. \n\nUnfortunately none of us can individually do much, but together we can finally move the needle. The NRA has been weakened in recent years, Texas is actually having a special session about gun violence (which may produce nothing, but an actual conversation is a start...), and Sen. Murphy of Connecticut claims to have \"some\" optimism at the federal level. \n\nThere's all sorts of advocacy/lobbying groups now to which you can donate or volunteer.  Some of them: Everytown, Sandy Hook Promise, Brady, Moms Demand, March For Our Lives. One June 11 you can to a protest that the latter group is organizing. \n\nCall and write your local state senator and representatives. Change usually happens at the local level. Volunteer to phone bank to get voters in Texas (among other key jurisdictions) registered to vote. Texas has come close to turning rational in some areas. Or write letters instead of phone banking, though calling is more effective.  \n\nYou will be best served by channeling your anger and frustration into action, or more action.",

But it's also the sort of singular event that when you say Norwegian mass shooting you don't have to ask, \"which one?\" like you would even saying something like \"Texas mass shooting\" never mind \"American mass shooting.\"",

Firearm regulations not being uniform across states is exactly what enables people to be trivially criminal with firearms by creating massive loopholes. These loopholes are then **easily** exploited, which is also the reason why the US is the source for the [vast majority of firearms used in the Americas](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-link-between-americas-lax-gun-laws-and-the-violence-that-fuels-immigration), particularly [those by criminals](https://insightcrime.org/news/floridas-gun-traffickers-supplying-brazils-largest-gang/).\n\n> Now you\u2019re making things up. \n\nI'm not making anything up, that's so far been all you, now even trying to deny your very own argument.\n\n> Didn\u2019t we just send lethal aid (assault rifles, other guns, Javelin missives, etc.) to Ukraine to help fight the Russians?\n\nWhich has what exactly to do with anything in regards to the US firearms problem? Do you realize that the very same planes that deliver arms, to extend a conflict, are being [sent back with humanitarian aid to the US](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/military-aircraft-arrive-baby-formula-europe-shortage-rcna29990)? To prevent American babies from starving. \n\nIn that context, I'm not really sure why you would even want to bring that up. Can't feed your babies, but at least you are pouring weapons into all kinds of conflicts, \"just let them eat bullets instead\" or what? \n\n> Maybe we should\u2019ve just banned all guns in Russia, made it a \u201cno gun zone\u201d, and Russia would\u2019ve stopped their invasion right? Of course not!\n\nOf course not, the real solution is to [just pour weapons into any conflict](https://www.smh.com.au/opinion/save-us-from-todays-dr-strangeloves-20160707-gq0d74.html), which will make it less bloody and lethal.

The opposite is also true, there are some countries with relaxed gun laws that don't see anywhere close to our amount of shootings. But all of those places also have poverty, shitty living conditions, and mental health problems as those aren't unique to the US. What is unique to the US is our gun culture, which has been around since at least the 1800s. From the old west, to the early 1900s organized crime, to the absurd amount of bank robbings in the 1980s-90s. We uphold them as the resistance to tyranny, a keystone of liberation. A good number of American heroes were exceptional with firearms. Other countries have guns but they are nowhere near as embedded into their countries identity. \n\n Honestly I probably haven't and won't word myself as well as I'd like to, but what I mean is that in the US guns are idolized as problem solvers. So when the mentally unwell decides he wants to be remembered or make a statement, he goes to guns as the answer.  It's not just that they are effective and deadly, it's that he's seen and been surrounded by a culture that feverishly loves guns. \n\nI'm really not against guns, I'm not calling for a ban. Self defense, home defense, hunting, sport all these things are great. But if we want to tackle mental health, as many 2A advocates claim, then we need to concede that guns can be and currently are a problem. Part of that means we need more regulations.",

As you say, some countries with huge amounts of widely available guns don't have the same amount of violent crime. Yet they do have problems with mental health, and perhaps even greater problems with providing health care in general. Yet, they don't have people shooting up schools. That indicates something far more fucked up than neglected mental health + guns is the problem here. IMO, that's an indicator of an ideological problem more than a mental health problem or even a gun problem (even though all of those exist currently in the US). I don't mean ideological in the narrow sense of named political ideology, but the broader ideologies that just permeate everyday life in the US: masculinity expressed through violence; toxic self-reliance; normalization of social atomization and isolation; the real and perceived economic and social precarity of the average (white*) man. There are more specific ideologies that prey on people who feel that way, explicitly and subtly instilling the creeping sense that the future is only going to get worse, and that it's the fault of [women/racial, sexual, religious minorities/liberals/etc.]. If you feel isolated and you despair at the future, it is easy and (in a fucked up way) logical to desire revenge against those who you consider responsible or vulnerable extensions of them. You don't have to be mentally ill to think these things--but it is extremely convenient for the ideologically radicalized to dismiss these mass shooters as \"mentally ill\" because they can plausibly argue that the premise of their ideologies do not naturally lead to mass violence. Again, this is not to say we don't have a gun problem, or a mental health problem, or a wealth inequality problem--we have all of those. My point is that ideology is the active ingredient in these mass shootings. \n\n *The underlying ideology of racial supremacy is so entrenched in American white culture, it expresses itself in conscious and subconscious ways. Not every school/mall/random shooter has been a white man (the whole of the US is fucked up after all), but they have been disproportionately represented. My pet theory is that the era of American \"general\" prosperity is over, and with that comes a contraction of privileges--precarious white men are particularly aggrieved by this, and therefore see revenge through mass violence against the public as a reasonable target of their revenge. This may be more or less consciously expressed through manifestos, political associations, social media posts, or even through media choices. The less conscious, the harder to prove, though.",

Australia had huge fires I think in the same year (just before the next disaster Covid hit) so I really felt for you guys. There\u2019s a really good book called \u2018Fire Country\u2019 about indigenous Aboriginal fire management and how those traditional methods could prevent future wild fires that we experience now. They\u2019ve known a hell of a lot more about managing Australian land and fires for a hell of a lot longer than any people who\u2019ve lived here after being colonised, really devastating that we haven\u2019t looked more towards their methods previously. \n\nSuch a strange thing for this guy to bring up in the discussion of gun culture\u2026like climate change / fires / floods are a worldwide issue. The equivalent would be if fires were starting because everyone owned and used flamethrowers was starting fires, and we refused to do anything about it because of our right to own a flamethrower",

For Australia this might work well. For the US I see large issues. One there are many firearms carried by criminals daily who seek to harm people around them who will not turn them in when asked. Two the court system has proven to be entirely too lenient on firearm law breakers. Three we cant rely on police to protect us from a lot of these crimes. That being said even if we had a gun surrender program and every law abiding citizen turned in every firearm they owned would I consider myself safer? Absolutely not and this is where that statement falls apart. Criminals would almost certainly become more brazen after knowing the public has been disarmed. I believe you saw this in Australia when you had an uptick in home invasions shortly after the firearm collection. There is always going to be outliers to these scenarios but implying you turning in your firearms help protect your fellow citizens is a bit of a stretch assuming you store them properly, can control your temper and take it as a serious responsibility.",

If it can be done online for cheap, that would work much better and people would be far more likely to comply.  \nAs it is, it is common for private sellers to ask to see a handgun permit. Handgun permits tend to be cheap and most law abiding people really do not want to sell to someone who is going to use it to commit a crime.",

Aside from the first couple of people who were caught by surprise, everyone nearby was able to just run away. A good samaritan stopped him by ramming him with a shopping trolley and taking the knife.\n\nWe had an indident where a mentally distressed person drove onto footpaths, and down pedestrian only areas of the city deliveratly trying to running people down. This was pretty bad, but again. People were able to run away, go into nearby buildings, stand behind obstacles, etc.\nThey put in bollards to prevent cars being able to get onto footpaths and into pedestrian areas very quickly afterwards.\n\n\nBut again. The damage these people can do is way way way less when they don't have access to fucking  assault rifles.\n\n\nAlso gives people a chance to calm the fuck down before doing something stupid, if there isn't just a handgun they can reach for when having an argument with someone.",

For sure in Australia we have people with serious mental illness who go nuts; but we have far better access to treatment and support so this is less of an issue to begin with. And then once you do get to an individual who's at the point of going on a murderous rampage, they don't have easy access to guns.\n\nBut that said, it's not like we don't have guns in Australia. \n\nI often get the impression Americans think we don't have any and can't get them. But it's not true: just about anyone who wants a gun can have one. I could go out right now and buy a gun (well maybe not *right now* because it's after business hours \ud83d\ude02). \n\nI'd just have to apply for a license (same as you go apply for a licence to drive a car), pass a basic gun safety course (same as for driving a car), I think there's a background check and you need a valid reason for owning a firearm. Valid reasons can be: I live on a farm and need it for livestock control or wild animal protection; could be I'm a gun collector with a membership in a shooting club. You have to have a safe storage cabinet for the gun, and a seperate storage cabinet for the ammunition. And yes there's limitations on handguns and assault weapons.\n\nBut I've yet to see anyone provide any compelling reason why all of those regulations for safe gun ownership are a bad idea (mostly it's just people saying \"my freedom\").\n\nYes, Australia conducted a large scale buyback and the federal government bought from the public and destroyed a huge stockpile of guns. Americans seem to be largely horrified that this happened, but no one seems to realise the main fact: it was 100% voluntary. No one was forced to give up their guns. It was just offered. We had one mass shooting in the country, and the government put stronger gun controls in place and bought back anyone's guns who wanted to surrender them, and by and large, the Australian public *applauded* this move. \n\nAnd we never had another tragic mass shooting in years. Our children don't have active shooter drills. \n\nI've never even seen a gun in real life in Australia. But just about everyone I know who has at any time in their life struggled with mental health has been able to go to their GP (for free with bulk billing under Medicare), get a referral to a psychologist or counselor with a mental health plan that they can then see for free or with a very small copay for 6-10 sessions. Imagine how many mass shootings in the US could be avoided if everyone had free and easy access to health care and mental health first aid... Even if it's just a percentage of them. Aren't your children's lives worth it?",

Combined with the current laws making scarcity of semi autos increasingly more expensive on the black market your average bad actor doesn't have the money or connections for guns let alone semi autos.\n\nAmerica's best argument if they have one at all is that there's too many guns to control. At first that would be true. But with a ban, a buyback, destroying all illegal firearms and harsh penalties on owning one unlicensed.. basic supply and demand will make them unobtainable even illegally eventually as they are here.",

From what later find out, there were non gang cars going past, the bikers all stopped shooting to let them pass, to keep taking each out out, when it was found out there were still people in businesses at the shooting location, each of them got out virtually unharmed. \n\nAlso Australia has more assistance towards medical treatment, so crime stays lower again. Even with the amount of guns we have out there, at least when we do the back ground checks, if a mental health issue is on their medical file, after investigation of why the mental health issue was, depends on getting the permit. \n\nAlso in Australia, putting on the form \"I need it for protection\" you get a visit from the AFP to see why you need protection, and less than 2% of those actually pass to get their licence.",

Shit, he\u2019s got fifty thousand dollars worth of bullets in his ass.\u2019\nAnd people would think before they killed somebody if a bullet cost five thousand dollars. \u2018Man I would blow your fucking head off\u2026if I could afford it.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m gonna get me another job, I\u2019m going to start saving some money, and you\u2019re a dead man. You\u2019d better hope I can\u2019t get no bullets on layaway.\u2019\nSo even if you get shot by a stray bullet, you wouldn't have to go to no doctor to get it taken out. Whoever shot you would take their bullet back, like \"I believe you got my property.\u201d",

That means *all* (with the exception I noted) are subject to that background check.  Beyond that everything is handled by state laws with less than half (21) states allowing permit less or open carrying.  All states have provisions for concealed carrying but:\n\n>All\u00a050 states\u00a0have laws in place that allow citizens to carry concealed weapons. However, some states will not issue permits or make it extremely difficult to acquire a permit. In 2018, over 17 million permits were issued throughout the nation.\n\n([source with much more info](https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/concealed-carry-states))\n\nPretty much all states, including permitless carry have some laws in place regarding the transport of weapons.  Frequently they have to be unloaded, locked in the trunk, and are only to be transported between point A and point B although the laws vary widely by state and type of gun.\n\n[Here](https://usasafeandvault.com/blogs/safes-vaults-store/are-gun-safes-required-why-ignoring-the-law-can-land-you-in-jail#:~:text=Texas%20law%20does%20not%20require,weapons%20to%20prevent%20unauthorized%20access.) is an article covering gun safe laws with some (but not nearly all) example state requirements.  As you can see, it varies widely by state.\n\n>There are literally videos on youtube of people walking down the street with open carry guns and it's legal with or without a licence in most states. \n\nNope, open/permitless carry is only legal in 21 states.  Even where it is legal there are frequently limitations such as not within X feet of a school or government building.\n\n>Don't know why you think lying is a good idea when I can literally look it up and find out in 30 seconds.\n\nI don't have a horse in this race, I am not a gun guy.  I own a few but I'm also a farmer and even under Australian laws what I have and why I have them would be totally legal.  My statement was that there is nowhere that the laws are as open as many no-americans believe.  That was not a lie, even in your case you were unaware that there are federal background checks.",

Private person to person sale (it has to be in person) is exempt which is the so-called \"gun show loophole\".  It's not really a loophole, it was a compromise at the time, I think on the assault weapons ban during the Clinton era.  It may still be true in your state though, as I told OP the states vary.  Meanwhile, in some states the background check is instant because you are just being checked against a national database but yes in others it takes time and in a few states and districts there are even long (multi day to multi week) waiting periods.",

Ultimately that's a pretty reasonable comparison, IMO just apply a similar system to gun ownership.

Because 99% of people arguing in good faith, would agree cars have reasonable regulations around them.\n\nIn the US, guns are a right, sure cool. But rights aren't without reasonable restrictions and responsibilities. A fit and proper person test would be fair (medical/background check). A safe storage requirement is fair. A restriction to single shot weapons is fair.\n\nBut if you wanna be a tool, fine anyone can own wherever guns they want, ammo is now illegal, gun control and an absolute compliance with the Second Amendment (is it the second amendment?).",

So they're \"gun ownership\" isn't comparable to countries like the US/Canada or Australia/UK/Europe. \n\nNot to mention a very low baseline crime rate. And a very strong focus on rehabilitation rather then punitive measures, very much unlike the US. But if you think they're doing well, why not emulate their system. Link gun ownership in the US with being a part of a Home Defence Mailitia, and have all the military gun regulations alongside that. \n\nOn South America vs the US. You do know what institutional stability means, right? If you don't that's cool. But South America is nowhere near comparable to the US for institutional stability. When was the last time the US disbanded a superior Court? Or had a major internal border change? Had a major University shutdown? \n\nMate the fucking UN is headquartered in the US?!\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23",

But easy access to guns is a major issue. Suicides are another example of often very good (law abiding) gun owners who kill someone with a gun.\n\nUltimately, the issue is easy access to guns. Because there are so many guns, it's really easy to get \"missing\" guns be it steal a gun and remove the numbers, or just buy a lawfully acquired gun and have the previous owner say it's gone missing etc. \n\nIf you're a good gun owner I respect that. Like I said I've got family who own guns. There cool. But they are a really deadly weapon. They're designed to kill people, they're VERY dangerous. IMO it's crazy that they're not at least treated with the same degree of licencing everyone in the world uses for cars.  Like I've said many times, cars are designed to not kill people, but they're so dangerous we as a society feel we need licencing systems to ensure your safe to drive. Why is it batshit insane to say \"things that are designed to kill people, should have at least that level of care taken with them.\"?\n\nGuns are dangerous, they ought to have a licencing system around them. You should have to prove your a safe gun user, and that your a fit and proper person to be allowed to own a gun (fit meaning medically & mentally fit; and proper meaning no past convictions etc). \n\nThat's a very reasonable regulation on what is a deadly weapon.",

To kill or injur typically a person. You're twisting the answer to fit an argument.\n\nReading the rest of your answers, I can only conclude your just arguing in bad faith or a pretty unreasonable person. Like it or not we (all people) live in a society, and to do that we need reasonable regulations around that. \n\nOne of the arguments that might have an impact on you is the harm principal that suggests rights should be limited where they infringe on another's rights. So your (global you) right to own a gun should be limited where it infringes on the rights of others (like their rights to be alive). Crazy thing, unfettered gun ownership pretty clearly infringes on the most fundamental but most important of rights ... for innocent children to not be killed.  \n\nYou specifically, no one cares about, but to prevent the most serious imaginable harm, innocent people being killed, rights like gun ownership must be limited or regulated. Same as we regulate the driving of cars (I don't know of any country that doesn't regulate car driving), heck under international law ship captains and airline pilots are regulated. \n\nIf you believe in any part in the law, you believe in rights being a compromise. But I don't think you're likely to genuinely consider that, and the implications of this. This isn't a \"some cultures differ\" situation, this is a universal truth every society makes choices (not always overt) between what behaviour is acceptable and unacceptable and it's always a compromise between different rights that individuals have. Yes, strong take, is one of them, and if that's the sort of views you have cool story bro. But most people very quickly agree that's pretty arbitrary.\n\nAlso the harm principal is pretty heavily embedded in the US Legal System and is applied to free speech, so we have laws like defamation where speech causes actual harm to to another.\n\nSucks to have your home invaded, I've had that happen to me, thankfully I was a child at the time and didn't really know what was happening so it didn't have much of an impact on me. But I did semi-recently have my car broken into and it's just awful, it felt like such a violation. But that's not a good reason to justify your views.",

And yes, you need permits for many weapons in both, including handguns for defensive purposes, and while some hunting semi-automatics are exempt in Switzerland (not so much in Sweden, for the record!) our gun laws pale in comparison to those in both nations. For instance in Sweden (not Switzerland I know you get confused) you need a separate license for each particular firearm and hunting licenses are, in most cases, restricted to bolt action rifles. Defensive personal carry is heavily restricted and monitored and the list of reasons that disqualify you for a firearm is long, as it should be. Everything is registered and you sure as hell don't have waiting period loopholes or fucking private party sales. You know, common sense things. Things that only people fully succumb to the toxic gun culture in America continue to rail against. Also, ask people in either what they think of American gun laws and they'll tell you how ridiculous we are over here and how we've gone off the figurative wild west deep end with our firearms mentality. \n\nAnyway, I digress, at this point we could mix Swedish and Swiss (again, different countries!) gun laws up in a hat and draw them at random for a better system than we have here now. People like you will still bitch and moan at having to sign a few more forms, acquire permits, prove competence, and maybe wait a little longer to get your next precious dick extender but that doesn't change the fact that stronger gun laws obviously work, they are necessary, and they are definitely coming.\n\nBut again, have fun on your mental gymnastics jungle gym for as long as you can!

The article you posted pointed out that you don't require a permit for semi auto matic weapons for hunting purposes... so any one could in theory buy an AR-15 with hollow point rounds without a permit in w/e example you gave, that is right out of the wiki.\n\nYou're proving my point, guns aren't the problem in a well armed populace. These shooters don't make snap decisions that any of these \"common sense\" gun laws you talk about because it's not about bad gun culture. Sure there are morons with weapons in the US but the mass shooters usually.. have clear red flags for years, purchase weapons and ruminate over BS until they work themselves up to go shoot up a school. Their activities never reach the FBI or any list that would prevent them from purchasing those weapons.\n\n>But again, have fun on your mental gymnastics jungle gym for as long as you can!

Again... what we've seen is the people in charge do not use the preventive measures they have at their disposal already.. and these kids keep passing background checks regardless of how many laws idiots like you want to put into place.\n\nYou'r pointing to a demographic that is different, has different crime rates and motivations for gun violence, and assuming the regulations will just magically work here.

Gun nuts reflexively oppose ANY reasonable reform.  Universal background checks?  Red flag law to protect domestic violence victims? Those aren't an attempt to take all guns away, those are obvious common sense, measured steps to stop the slaughter of innocents, and yet, every proposal, no matter how modest, is met with screeches of 'shall not be infringed' from the gun cult. Gun nuts, instead of proactively trying to help arrive at solutions, are instead a massive obstruction.

That leave overwhelming, the only way anything either side want to happen will happen is if they gain a overwhelming majority in government and according to recent polls that doesnt look like it will happen.\n\nSo here we all are stuck in the middle with extremist on both ends messing things up for everyone.",

That's it. That was the whole proposal. It wasn't a massive attack on the second amendment, or on gun ownership in general. It's just the most basic thing we could do to save women's lives, today. And the gun nuts fucking opposed it. Because of 'principal'. Yeah, no, if you value your guns more than the lives of victims of domestic violence, you don't get to claim any principal, at all.   \n\nSo you don't get to  ascribe to gun control advocates some nefarious goal, when the gun cult is unwilling to concede literally anything whatsoever, even to save victims' lives. You choose to 'hold that ground' then you own the results.",

First you say we need background checks and everyone says yes then you say no 30 rd magazines and everyone say ok then no 10rd ok then no 5 rd ok then single shot only etc etc. Most gun owners would welcome different or tougher rules but the problem is they dont trust the other side to stop taking things away and restricting them until you have no right anymore so the gun crowd has taken a stance of dont give a inch because it leads to a mile. Honestly its the way anyone looses anything a little bit at a time like women with abortion after Roe it was a free for all so to speak no real resrictions of any kind and the opponents couldnt get it over turned so they started incrementaly changing it little by little  and the people that support abortion in the spirit of working with the other side would bend on little things ok no late term then no mid term then finally when the right was on the wall and texas was passing heartbeat bills and such women looked around and realize over time they had given up everything they had gained inch by inch\n\nYou cant meet in the middle when one side is negotiating in bad faith the the gun croud stopped negotiating \n\nIt sad for everyone",

[They were rare before 1996 and they were rare afterwards.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_massacres_in_Australia) Another problem is that better medical care has 'reduced' the mass shooting rate, if you define it by a certain number of deaths. \n\nSo it's tough to assign a causal link between the law and any beneficial effect.",

I've been around gun people in the US, and there are a lot of idiots who seem to combine ignorance with machismo - which is probably why there is strict gun control at gun shows, and why no guns are allowed at NRA conventions.\n\nBut I digress. It seems to me the biggest problem here in the US is the near-total lack of concern for others. A lot of people seem to think anyone they don't personally know and who might look or think differently is subhuman, and not deserving of consideration or care. THAT I think is the biggest difference between people in the US and people in other developed or near-developed nations, and I don't really know how we could even **begin** to address that.

But, I'm sure everyone will argue fruitlessly about it because they're emotionalizing and politicizing guns.

Hell, as a young boy I internalized that story and how it was clearly sexist and awful, and we should make the world a better place where women have choices. \n\nYet my mother seems to completely lack the ability to take her personal experience of injustice and apply it to anything outside herself.

The British were trying to suppress the press and disarm the people. They were also requiring the colonies to pay and house the British soldiers. The American colonies didn't want a federal government acting in the same manner as the British government. After all, what would have been the point of the American Revolution? Therefore the amendments that make up the Bill of Rights were added. What they share in common are what the federal government is not allowed to do. Take note of the third amendment; the British were still fresh on everyone's mind.\n\nMadison, Hamilton and Jay wrote the federalist papers to convince the people of New York to join.

You can see there's increased violence, but none of the people goading the public into it are affected by it. It's kind of baffling.\n\nI've always been a supporter of the second amendment, and this has me seriously wondering if there's any point. The government is supposed to be afraid of the people. It's clearly not afraid enough, and no one's doing anything about it.",

You would get a similar argument to free speech to be against legislation about hate speech. \n\nFor the other part, a vast majority of people and gun owners don't think the government is too corrupt right now/yet, so we would expect nothing to happen and those firearms not be used.

It could have been a mass shooting, but luckily(?) not enough people died.\n\nThere was a man who shot and killed his whole family - enough people to qualify as a mass shooting, but because they were his family and it was a personal thing, it doesn't count for some reason.\n\nPlus a kid was set to shoot up Monash University only a year after Port Arthur, but another student tackled him before he really got going.\n\nThose are just the cases I know off the top of my head. A mass shooting could still happen here. They're just far less likely.\n\nI don't want to be on some high horse like we're better than everyone.\n\n*Edit: it seems as though some people have interpreted this comment as an argument against gun control. It is not. At all. I responded specifically to the 'Australia has never had another mass shooting' factoid I hear smugly thrown around. I hate it. It is said like 'Australia can't have mass shootings any more'. All it would take is for one nutter like the Australian who shot up Christchurch to take it as a challenge to break that streak just to kill that argument.*",

The shooter was severely delusional and will be in a psychiatric institution until possibly 2027. After the shooting, the rules for handguns were tightened up significantly and new buyback programs run to get non-compliant handguns off the streets.\n\nLindt Cafe - if I remember correctly, police stormed the cafe, the gunman killed one hostage, the police killed the gunman and another hostage and wounded three more hostages and one police officer. The inquiry afterwards found the gunman only hit one person - Tori Johnson - all other deaths and injuries were from police bullets.\n\nI never got the impression that wotsisname ever intended it to be a mass shooting - it was more of a hostages & demands siege, and the police refusal to negotiate probably made it worse than it had to be.\n\nWe've had two instances of farmers deciding to murder their whole family and themselves, where that would count as a mass shooting. Those get counted under domestic violence but they do appear in some mass shooting stats. They are a bit different from what people think of as a mass shooting because of the intimate or family relationship between murderer and victims, because the victims are also all closely related, and because it happens entirely on private property belonging to one of the people involved. We *definitely* have a problem with domestic violence in this country.\n\nWe also recently had someone kill four people in Darwin.\n\nThere's no room for complacency, but for us at least, gun control has worked, and worked brilliantly.",

It was only a few nutters that didn't want to give up their guns. But in the end they didn't have to give them up completely and they had like 5 years amnesty to do anything about it. Some guns were outlawed completely, so those had to be surrendered. Things like rifles with a magazine of over 3 or 5 bullets were out unless you are a collector. If you wanted to keep your other guns you just had to get them registered and your license amended to show what category gun you owned and then take a safety class. Every few years we have an amnesty period where you can hand in your unregistered firearms with no questions asked and no legal repercussions.",

Does a pistol grip make you more accurate? Marginally, I suppose, but they did just fine on Normandy without them.\n\nHow about a flash hider? Do people really think that by only allowing weapons without flash hiders we'll somehow be safer? It's fucking meaningless.\n\nHow about a barrel shroud which literally only functions as a heat shield so you don't burn yourself? Clearly that is what's causing the gun crisis in the states.\n\nMeanwhile there are plenty of weapons that don't fit any of these categories which are not just perfectly functional but are **actual military battle rifles used in war**.

Also, after the patents expired, copycat companies also started using the design for ARs, also using their competitor's name in your version of events. But that's not how business works, and the original ArmaLite AR-15 (thats the official name it carried: ArmaLite AR-15) was named such due to it being a **military** assault rifle, nothing else.",

Are your animals armed?\n\nNo, just our middle-schoolers. \n\nYou know, I reallized how big a problem we have when I was watching a clip for the British detective show Luther. These gangsters have Luther tied to a chair, and they've got a revolver, questioning him in a Russian Roulette style manner. Luther manages to break the chair he's in, which undoes the ropes and allows him to make a play for the gun. Through the shock and quickness of it, he gets the revolver and points it at the bad guys. \n\nAt this point, I'm expecting Luther to maybe shoot one of them and kind of run across the room to cover before they can draw down on him. But that's it. He points it, conflict over. They raise their hands in surrender. Why?  \n\n\n*Because they've only got the ONE gun!*\n\nI'm like, \"Wow.....these guys are professional criminals and they've got ONE gun. Our middle-schoolers are better armed than they are!\"\n\nThe real life thing that trips me out is the whole active shooter drill thing. I'm a little older than most of the mass school shootings; Columbine happened around the time I was in high school. It wasn't yet an annual tradition. But the fact that there are kids practicing for active shooters like I used to have to practice for tornado or fire drills is insane.",

It struck me last night that my class was the last to graduate without that shadow. \n\n(Although man, were times different; there were a couple months when we were getting *bomb threats* on a weekly basis- kids were calling them in to get out of school) \n\nI've volunteered/worked at my kiddo's schools since day one. I've participated in three lockdown drills (sounds less scary than active shooter, but that's what it is). At one school, on a military base, it was simply duck and cover. At our next *civilian* elementary school, we practiced [ALICE drills](https://www.alicetraining.com/about-us/). The drills were horrible. I could barely make it through without crying. I shushed kids treating it like a game, and comforted others who were terrified, as we hid behind the storage shed that we \"escaped\" to.\n\nBut those drills did their job. When the voice came over the intercom and said \"lockdown, lockdown, lockdown. This is not a drill\", we knew exactly what to do. I was in a room full of 2nd graders (6-7yo), one other adult. There was no hesitation or conversation. In less than a minute, we were ready. \n\nI spent 20 minutes crouched in front of \"my\" kids, ready to protect them, praying with every ounce of my being to anything out there that my *own* child, on the other side of the school, was safe. \n\nIt was a false alarm.",

This would not appear to make sense. You have greater velocity but the bullet is lighter.\n\nstoner: There is the advantage that a small or light bullet has over a heavy one when it comes to wound ballistics. \u2026 What it amounts to is the fact that bullets are stabilized to fly through the air, and not through water, or a body, which is approximately the same density as the water. And they are stable as long as they are in the air. When they hit something, they immediately go unstable. \u2026 If you are talking about .30-caliber [like a bullet used in the M-14], this might remain stable through a human body. \u2026 While a little bullet, being it has a low mass, it senses an instability situation faster and reacts much faster. \u2026 this is what makes a little bullet pay off so much in wound ballistics.",

In order to have a functioning militia, they needed it's citizens to be able to keep and bear arms as militias largely relied on citizens bringing their own equipment. To do this those citizens needed the civil right to own those firearms suitable for militia duties at all times, as militias were not standing armies and anyone of certain age could be called up to serve in a militia if it was determined to be needed.",

Assault weapon ban for example can have an absolutely maximum reduction of gun deaths of about %4 based on number of deaths from said weapons, and that is making the huge assumption than perpetrators would not just pick another firearm and do the same thing, which is frankly silly. And any legislation that will significantly impact gun deaths will make a majority of firearms illegal  (semi auto firearms are a majority of rifles sold today and in circulation) . \n\n\nMost people wouldn't care about enhanced background checks but its hard to say how much it will do, if someone hasn't been convicted of a crime they will still be able to purchase a firearm. Raising the age may help, but again if civil rights are fully available to you at 18, then we should respect that, or it sets up holding back other civil rights too (some will disagree on this of course) \n\nSome things that are shown to really help for mass shootings (and suicides)  at least is reduced media contagion, by not reporting about to. However personally I think laws restricting that run afoul of the 1nd amendment and think it would be voluntary. \n\nFocus on root causes like lack of good role models and available opportunities to move up in the world do a lot to reduce gun violence and can be done without loads of people.foghtinf against you for it. \n\nAnd the biggest factor I predicting if someone will cause harm with a firearm is previously committing crimes with a firearm, however you see the opposite side neglecting this by letting firearm crime go without charges as it tends to affect the disadvantaged.",

On Political issues they're only thinly veiled legal conclusions that are really political conclusions. Really much of the US system is such that most all the Courts are almost entirely beholden to a political party, the media are aligned with a party (or IMO more likely this is the tail wagging the dog). Look at a problem and find a good solution the US Government does not, it's all about the agenda, metrics, optics and alignment... \n\n\nI don't think even a clear direct statement in the constitution would stop the US Supreme Court from finding a political outcome they wanted.",

In any society it's just much easier to say \"think of the children\" (Ironically not very effective for gun control in the US, but super effective for police powers), or \"Terrorist\" & \"Pediphile\" and almost any police powers get doubled. \n\nI think we need far more judicial oversight, a judge granting a warrant should be allocated at random and should have a higher burden upon them. And police should face far more serious consequences for abuse and missuse of power and that power followed/checked far more stringently. \n\nMetadata retention shouldn't be a thing. And internet security should be taken seriously. \n\nBut just wait the MSM will start to claw at the new Labor Government very shortly. The vast majority of the MSM have overtly aligned with the LNP who basically were indefensible at the last election (and I traditionally am an LNP voter, but they've been VERY bad for a VERY long time, they really don't govern for the people).",

The real difference is guns. Before Port Arthur we had 13 mass shootings in 18 years. It was relatively regular. Then we implemented strong gun laws. We didn't change our mental health system.

So we can see how guns are the most prominent murder weapon world wide.\n\nSource: https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/global-study-on-homicide.html\n\nWhy might this be?  Simply put a gun makes it so much easier to kill someone (thats the reason they were invented). Doesn't matter how big and strong you are or how proficient in martial arts you are, any idiot with half-decent aim can kill you. Attacking someone with a knife or other melee weapon requires a lot more risk. Its also easier to stop someone with a knife as they cant just spray and pray.\n\nHowever you may argue that this still doesn't prove that gun control is necessary. After all if gun-related murders can happen in countries that have gun control, doesn't that prove it is useless?\n\nWell lets compare murder rates between the G7 countries from the year 2018:\n\nJapan: 0.26 murders per 100,000 people\n\nItaly: 0.57 murders per 100,000 people\n\nGermany: 0.95 murders per 100,000 people\n\nFrance: 1.20 murders per 100,000 people\n\nUnited Kingdom: 1.20 murders per 100,00 people \n\nCanada: 1.75 murders per 100,000 people\n\nUSA: 4.96 murders per 100,000.\n\nSource: https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/murder-rate-by-country\n\nSo compared to its peers (all of which have much stricter gun control) the United States has far more homicides.  In fact it has almost three times the number of murders as the next most violent country in that list.\n\nDoes gun-control completely eliminate the chances of a criminal murdering someone with a gun? No.\n\nDoes gun-control immensely decrease the chances of this happening? Yes!\n\n\"Gun bans are unlikely to stop those determined to commit a mass murder.\"\n\nTrue it may not completely stop them. But what it does do is stop them grabbing a device designed specifically to kill many people in quick succession in order to kill many people in quick sucession.",

Obviously if you point out that democracy exists in places with fewer guns they just sort of plug up their ears and insist that those places don't really have democracy because if the gov. wanted it could just pass whatever laws it felt like and the people couldn't do anything about it. \n\nThis runs really deep - it's a part of these people's identities. Under no circumstances will they even consider the idea that removing guns could be a good thing, because in their minds, removing guns means suddenly you are living in a dictatorial state.\n\nThe other part of it is that these same people have been convinced that, practically, there is no legislation that could possibly help, because even if you banned guns, people would just find illegal ones if they wanted one. \n\nTaken all together you get a country where like 1/4 of the population is so attached to the right to bear arms that they literally care about it more than the lives of children, and they are convinced that any laws passed to restrict those rights wouldn't reduce fatalities at all, and would just make life worse for everyone. \n\nThey can't be reasoned with.",

We would expect a place like china with a population of  1.4 billion to have a firearm related death rate of about 171k per year. They don't have even a fraction of that.\n\nLet's scale it back. Australia. We would expect about 3.134.18 per year. Over the last 19 years their TOTAL number of firearm related deaths is 4478. that's total. over 19 years. \n\nSo why are our numbers so off? Because the density of population is only a SMALL factor.\n\nHow do we know this? Because Venezuela has a lower population than the united states and has an instance of firearm related death of 49.22 people per 100k. Answer. Venezuala is a destabilized and collapseed economy LITTERED with cheap firearms from the U.S. does that mean the U.S could be worse? Yep. But we could be better too.",

It's a basic repsonsibility of the presenter.\n\n> Because the question is more nuanced, the NUMBER of guns, availability of guns and the cultures attitudes TOWARDS guns are more important variables.\n\nYou can only start to determine their influence if the statistics you are comparing are per capita rates.\n\n> The use of population numbers as a variable only has value insofar as it's used to contrast the datasets and normalize them to come up with easily digestible per-capita facts.\n\nIt's not a question of being \"easily digestible\". Per-capita figures are the **only** comparable figures in cases like this. Turning an absolute number of incidents into a per-capita rate is a basic requirement when comparing statistics between areas.\n\n---\n\nEdit: I see you got mad and blocked me. Nice!

There will always be outliers, but you have to admit that something needs to be done. In no other first world country do you hear of so many mass shootings in such a small frame of time. \n\nIt also helps that police aren't dealing with firearm related incidents so often that there are more resources dedicated to finding those outliers to help prevent such things. Even then people fall through the cracks. A shooting in Nova Scotia a few years ago, a guy in a truck intentionally hit a Muslim family in Ontario last year, etc. But these events don't happen daily or even weekly, not even monthly.

Now compare that to our pathetic 66% of eligible voters actually voting in the 2020 US presidential election, which was the highest turnout in 120 years. Add to that the fact that we allow for all sorts of gerrymandering designed to make various people's votes count less, voter suppression, notoriously understaffed age poorly run polling places, refusal to implement campaign finance reform, demonstrable lack of transparency compared to other developed countries, etc., etc. Now tell me, whose choice has been taken away?\n\nPoll after poll shows that the majority of Americans support some kind of increase in restrictions on guns, yet that never seems to be reflected in our \"representation\" in the legislature, which seems to be much more in line with large lobbying entities backed by weapons and munitions companies.  Australians voted and got what they voted for. Who had freedom of choice there, and who didn't? I know that's a really hard concept to wrap your head around when you've been taught your whole life that America is the bestest, free-est place ever and everyone else is jealous, but believe it or not we as a country are flawed just like everyone else, and sometimes we get things wrong.

This has never happened in my experience,  and if it does happen,  additional laws won't be effective since they are willing to break them,  but they should be punished. I don't know of any cases where a store intentionally skipped mandatory background checks. \n\nOnto the other thing,  we don't need \"assault rifles \" (a loaded term,  there's no gun classified as an \"assault rifle\", it's a media buzzword ) to defend against burglary. The second amendment doesn't give us guns to keep our homes safe from burglars, it gives it to us explicitly to prevent tyranny of government.  \n\nAs to the age thing,  if every American has the right to bear arms,  and 18 is when you're considered an adult,  then why shouldn't an 18 year old with no criminal history or mental issue history be allowed to purchase a fire arm? It's his right,  it's not like he's going to go on a rampage the second he's armed.\n\nThe drinking age should be lowered. You can sign your life to the army but you can't enjoy a beer? Ridiculous.  To me,  that's the issue with being able to buy a gun before you can drink,  it's inconsistent,  we should treat 18 year olds as adults if that's the age we've decided is adulthood,  otherwise the age of voting and signing up for military service should be raised.",

Switzerland and other countries have a lot of guns and low gun crime rates.   \nSocial conditions are what matter.  \nThe US had its highest gun violence rate ~1994. Gun violence went steadily down to its lowest level ~2016. During that time the assault weapon ban ended and millions of ARs were sold, more guns than ever in general were sold, and gun laws were loosened, with concealed carry or constitutional carry coming to most states. Obviously there are other factors that effect gun crime rates more than the amount and access to guns.  \nProhibiting guns outright would require amending our constitution. We can hate that and disagree with it all we want but that is the legal reality that needs to be dealt with. We don't trust our government and we trust the police even less. So in that environment, it is especially not going to happen.",

True compromise would be \"you have to be 21 to buy any firearm, but we will deregulate suppressors and a few other NFA items\", but we all know that won't happen.

Does she speak for you or the right?\n\n3) I agree that it should be looked at why some peoples mental health is so jacked up. But that\u2019s not the whole issue. The guy in Buffalo knew exactly what he was doing and had the presence of mind to hide what his goals were until it was too late. \n\n4) That\u2019s not true that these shooting are taking place where people aren\u2019t armed. How do you explain Texas then? The guy in Buffalo killed a retired cop when he tried to stop him. So, right there. Two instances of good guys with guns being unable to stop bad guys with guns. Hell, let\u2019s go yesterday. Tulsa. More than 54% of the population owns at least one firearm. Why didn\u2019t anyone stop that from happening?\n\n4) Whether you like it or not, America NEEDS a constant supply of immigrants to come to America to work.  Without it, our economy would fall and then collapse. So we need people to come here. \n\n5) AND HERE WE GO!! Why are you trying to use strawman tactics to argue what I would like or what compromise is before anything is even said. You are already on the defensive about ANY sort of compromise and just going to stomp you feet and screen NO like a petulant child. I am all for your compromise!

You immediately stepped into \"ban it\" territory, which is not the argument I was putting forward.\n\nIn each of these cases, speed limits are not very strongly correlated with traffic incidents, I would support restricting fatty and sugary foods, alcohol and tobacco products are already age restricted, home pools could require a little fence around them.",

You have a line that is an acceptable amount of people to die for something to remain legal. Another person might say one it too many and alcohol should be restricted to only drinking in certain locations, none at home, and only under 6% abv because all the people dying from DUIs is above their threshold.\n\nThat doesn't mean that they are right and alcohol should be banned or restricted.",

Lots of people who don't understand how fundamentally broken the US is commenting about what we should do. Nevermind that pre-Columbine, school shootings were rare as all hell. Coinciding with the destruction of school funding in the US and all of that really was a recipe for disaster.\n\nKids aren't raises by parents because they have to grind out one or two jobs each, schools are too underfunded, and school culture creates horrible bullying and doesn't help kids out.",

To be clear, yes there was like one shooting like 5 years ago, but as far as I\u2019m aware, that\u2019s the only one we\u2019ve had in the last 20 years. As an Australian I can say we heavily stigmatise guns, and have a kneejerk reaction to them as a culture that we should repulse them. I was born here, but I lived in America for 5 years when I was growing up, and looking back on it now I\u2019m kind of disgusted by how laissez faire the attitude on guns was. Personally I just believe that a heavier restriction on guns is a baseline that establishes just a bit more safety in an entire society. I feel that even just rudimentary psychological testing, background checks, and gun safety courses could make a world of difference.",

It isn't unrealistic to say the second ammendment isn't really relevant today, given the advances in weapons technology and the scope of the ammendment itself.\n\nIt isn't a small number that aren't responsible with weapons.  It's a statistically significant number of people.  Guns are now the leading cause of death for children:\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2022/04/22/1094364930/firearms-leading-cause-of-death-in-children\n\nA big part of the problem here is the narrative you need guns to protect yourself, but the main reason for this is because you're afraid of other people with guns.  What we end up with is a lot of armed people with very little in the way of training wildly overestimating their capabilities.  If self defense is such an important thing why are there so many more restrictions on other weapons like knives or batons?\n\nMaybe instead of being a part of the problem you should support police reform, such as better training, actual consequences for their actions, and the obligation to protect and serve.  Guns just do more damage to society than good and studies have been done that prove just that:\n\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/more-guns-do-not-stop-more-crimes-evidence-shows/\n\nYou are right that a debate isn't great for you.

But I'm happy for people with problems like chronic pain as it seems cannabis is surprisingly effective at chronic pain relief.\n\nAs for other drugs, like I said: probably not going to benefit from a heroin shop on each street. But there are other drugs (particularly party drugs) that would benefit from legalisation and regulation, because of the commom problems associated with making a popular drug illegal. Since legalizing something means we can regulate it, there's more opportunity to help people before harm is done.\n\nNow on the flip side, there's a big opioid problem in America, partly because doctors are prescribing too often to people that don't really need it. Since opiates tend to be fairly/pretty addictive and there's a massive supply of it, I feel like something should be illegal there.\n\nIn short: drug good if help more than hurt",

                          "text": "\"statistics under scrutiny: Why some experts disagree with the CRPC report on mass shooters  \nMany statisticians believe the reason the CRPC study's results seem so counterintuitive is that they are incorrect. One of the more detailed analyses appeared on the fact-checking website snopes.com and concluded that the CRPC report used \u201cinappropriate statistical methods\u201d which led to misleading results.  \nAccording to the fact-checkers' analysis, one of those inappropriate methods was the leaving out of the many European countries that had not experienced a single mass shooting between 2009-2015. This data would not have changed the position of the U.S. on the list, but its absence could lead a reader to believe\u2014incorrectly\u2014that the U.S. experienced fewer mass shooting fatalities per capita than all but a handful of countries in Europe.  \nA more important oversight was the report's use of average deaths per capita instead of a more stable metric. Because of the smaller populations of most European countries, individual events in those countries had statistically oversized influence and warped the results. For example, Norway\u2019s world-leading annual rate was due to a single devastating 2011 event, in which far-right extremist Anders Behring Breivik gunned down 69 people at a summer camp on the island of Ut\u00f8ya. Norway had zero mass shootings in 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015.  \nAn easy, though arguably insensitive, way to illustrate the shortcomings of this approach is to apply it to the 9/11 attacks, which killed 2,977 people in the United States on a single day in 2001. Running that data through the CRPC formula yields the following statistic: Plane hijackings by terrorists caused an average of 297.7 deaths per year in the U.S. from 2001-2010. This is mathematically accurate, but it gives a badly distorted impression of what actually happened during those ten years.  \nIn addition, the CRPC study went a step further and computed average annual deaths per capita. Critics argue this further warps the data, because Norway\u2019s population is a fraction of the U.S. population. As a result, Norway\u2019s death rate came out more than 20 times higher than that of the U.S.\u2014which tallied 66 deaths in 2012 alone (nearly matching Norway's total for the full study) and averaged at least one mass shooting death per month for the entire seven-year data set.\"",

Which I believe is a bad idea. But even then, murder, especially with a weapon. Is still illegal. If it does come down to fisticuffs. Most cases result in a fist fight. And not much difference to a Europeans country. It\u2019s way more rare than you think.",

Registries are bad because then the government knows who has what guns. People already can't buy guns because of mental health conditions. Expanding on it could risk taking away this inherent right from people that don't deserve to lose it. I like the idea of having some course you can to take before getting to buy a gun. But making that a requirement turns it from a right to a privilege that the government decides who can have that right.\n\nI vote for actually having a more comprehensive look at the mental health of kids in the us. Guns have been around for a long time but you don't see many school shootings in the past. That tells me that adding more gun control won't help. Guns have always been around and there were not tragedies like these school shootings. Heck kids even used to bring guns to school to go hunting or target practice after school.\n\nThat all tells me that the problem is not the guns.",

Population density and size definitely play a role or else it wouldnt have been so common to see big cities being more violent and crime-ridden than other areas\n\nRussia is alo underdeveloped. Compare to the very democratic and uncorrupt coutnries in the west that have no guns with America. Case closed mate. It doesn't counter my point. There are countries like Pakistan that allow open carry of AK47's that are the most authoritarian countries in the word. The point is that guns and corruption.authoritarianism aren't correlated. No point is countered if the only example is one country in a vacuum and isn't evfery country in the worl mate.\n\n>I never said these issues are exclusive to the US. Im saying thag size and population density contribute a lot to these issues. And only someone mentally disabled would think that government has 0 involvement in any of the mass shootings. Theres no way the vegas shooter could have pulled off what he did all on his own. Passing very strict security, managing to either move or break thick tempered glass windows that weigh heavier than people. Also the buffalo shooter somehow able to afford such expensive gear despite being jobless and very poor. And driving way past his enemies to target a gun free zone. Not saying that theyre 100% government psyops, but the lines dont match up for your typical mass shooter. They're very sus\n\nCool story. population and land mass aren't correlated to corruption/authoritarianism. Your points are redundant.\n\n>  \nBanning guns wont lower school shootings and violent crime rate mate. Itll only make the citizens defenseless while giving criminals and government more power over them\n\nStatistically you are incorrect. Every other developed country has done the same thing and has dealt with the issue that America still deal with today and that you still give excuses to. The rest of the developed world is your proof that you are just defending some brain dead coping mechanism because of some 18th century law.",

Cause banning guns would give the corrupt even more power than before? Why do you want your cousins of the west to turn into subjects to corrupt rulers? Also semi auto is good against bears, boars, and moose. Animals that australia dont really have to worry about. The tankiest animal they got is emus and they lost a war to them\n\nHow am i incorrect on speech? Hate speech laws contradict freedom of speech so by technicalities, we do have more freedom of speech\n\nAlso you seem to ignore the fact that the middle east is in a constant religious war. To say that all its violence stems from citizens being able to carry guns is just plain braindead. Treating women like property is literally part of their religion and culture\n\nPopulation density may not be correlated to corruption, but it is correlated to violence. Theres too many people here and too bunched together. The fact that every major city in america tends to have higher violent crime rates than suburbs and small towns is testament to that\n\nAlso not all violent crime is strictly gun crime. Australias violent crime actually got a spike increase after its new gun laws, but steadily lowered then rised a little bit throughout the years\n\nIf you actually think banning guns will work in the US. Look towards the war on drugs and look towards the prohibition era on alcohol. Even if they tried to, it wont work. Especially since these shootings continued to rise after MORE regulations. Almost as if they have the opposite effect on the US. You want to put all the blame on the guns but completely ignore every other factor. Its like someone who brings up the 13/50 for black people but ignores all other factors as to why. They just wanna be mean to black people\n\nIn the UK. Stabbings and acid attacks are still common. Getting lower then higher each year too. Guess their solution didnt work as intended either",

Pretty sure more speech laws=less freedom of speech. Its not a hard concept to grasp\n\nAlso if the bans we talked about increased violence in the US but worked in other countries, doesn't that just prove that laws in other countries simply wont work for the US? I mean were comparing small and monoethnic/almost monoethnic countries to one of the most culturally, politically, and racially diverse countries in the world. Its like comparing a fork to a water hose. Both are way too different to be applied the same way\n\nI still dont see the logic in banning guns in the most corrupt developed country in the world. If its as bad as you claim, then you dont want US to ban guns for the safety of the people. You just want it to turn into a dictatorship. Like its hard to take your argument seriously when you want to unarm citizens of the \"most corrupt country\"\n\nI also don't understand the fear of ar 15s. Theyre basically better pistols. Semi auto, bigger mags, and better bullets. Thats really the three biggest differences between them and magazine size wont really make much of a difference in a school shooting. A lot of people arguing against them only do it cause they think \"bigger means scarier\". However, an ar15 would be a lot more difficult to conceal than a pistol and would be much harder to sneak past police that actually do their jobs",

And needed mounting. It wasn't portable. They weren't widespread. Was crew-served. So essentially moot. \n\n>Also, the early twentieth century had very very lax gun laws to where you could buy full auto guns from a Sears catalog, yet there were almost no mass shootings.

Also nothing remotely like what we have today. \n\n>It is the combination of these factors that make me believe that restricting guns is not going to any good as it only treats a symptom, not the source\n\nHow so? The source is people who should not be having guns, having access to them. Remove/restrict that access, and that's a core problem gone. If you mean that all guns must be removed, then that's ludicrous. Other countries with strict gun laws don't even have that. \n\n>How many times have these people also been on the radar for the fbi yet nothing was done to prevent the shooter from killing?

When literally every person is surveilled, obviously they fall into that category. Do you know *exactly* what he was known to them for and for how long?\n\nAlso how do you act on someone who has yet committed a crime? Surely the best option is to reduce the potential of them committing a crime without taking direct action on the individual.",

In the 20s, a tommy gun cost $125 with all the bits and bobs, which is around $1800-1900 today, which is very average for firearms today. \n\nThe feds knowing who may be a threat and not being able to act on it is all the more reason I feel people should own a firearm for personal defense, but that should be decided by the individual if they want one, not the government.\n\nMentally disturbed individuals are the ones that are going out and breaking the law, not your average neighbor. The way people wish to further restrict gun control will do no good. Background checks will never find something if they have no prior history, such as felonies or undiagnosed mental illness. It won't find things that haven't been caught before.\n\nRemoving guns is only going to cause more problems. Noncooperation will be immense, both for police and citizens. It would be a bloody mess trying to confiscate firearms.",

It think laws, poverty, social structure, economy, government, religion, guns, drugs, etc would all play a factor. I think it would be a far more productive discussion than just saying guns period.",

You sound ignorant when you claim guns are the only tool of massacres. For example China had a school massacre with a knife. One assailant left 33 dead and wounded 130 others. A knife attack in Japan left 19 dead. Add in arson, Australias new preferred method of massacres, and bombs, and gas attacks and just ramming people with trucks and you will find that there is no end to human ingenuity when it comes to killing.",

This is purely because now instead of simply robbing you and leaving, the assailants see you attempting to attack them. The chances of you winning are extraordinarily slim.\n\nGuns are cool I get it, but the fact is they're causing unnecessary deaths. The solution to gun deaths is not introducing more guns, that just spirals the situation out of control.",

So is panic firing, where maybe 2 out of ten shots hit. What if you miss the first 6 because of panic, but then hit the next 4? If an armed person breaks into my house, you better believe I'm going to keep firing until he stops moving, and if his buddies hear 10+ rounds in quicks succession then they probably got the idea my house was a bad choice. My neighbors will probably be calling the cops before I get the chance to, because rifles indoors are loud as hell. \n\n>average citizen isn't a 20 week Quantico graduate with multiple marksman medals\n\nNeither are most cops, so why would you want the only guns left for the layman to buy be unnecessarily complex and harder to manage than what is possible? \n\n>LE has guns because they know how to use them and train day in and out\n\nNo, they don't. Maybe the really good ones go shooting once a week. \n\n>5/10 civilians with guns have no formal training at all.\n\nDo you have any idea how many civilians are Veterans or have gone to formal training courses? Because realistically it's probably not half the population, which is why I fully support the idea of putting licenses to carry behind a course of either \"formal training totaling of 10 hours\", or proof of prior military service. Unfortunately that's not likely to pass, in favor of more attempts that will hit major resistance.",

                                  "text": ">panic firing,\n\nIs when you lose all your shots because you're not calm and collected, as is very common with civilians with little to no training. Like I said if you can't land 6 shots you can't land 60. Volume will not help if you don't have years of adequate training. The most likely scenario is either you aim your gun at the attacker and get gunned down because they have more informal experience than you, or you sneak up on them and your nerves are shot. You mess up the first shot and get killed.\n\n>Neither are most cops\n\nMost cops do in fact train at least weekly, often bi weekly. A \"trained\" civilian usually pass one, maybe two total firing range training sessions.\n\n>No, they don't\n\nThey do. It's required for all members of Law Enforcement to be fluent in firearms, which includes mandatory firearms training every few weeks to ensure correct handing of guns.\n\n>Do you have any idea how many civilians are Veterans or have gone to formal training courses?\n\nVery few, I was being generous. Honestly there's just no reason a civilian needs a gun. Certainly not for self defense. Ranchers may need access to buckshot or slug shotguns for defense from wild animals like hogs and bears, but no inner city civilian needs a gun, as it only increases, not decreases their chance of survival. On the off chance a \"good\" civilian uses a gun against an armed gunman, they will probably be shot by local law enforcement since they're now considered armed and dangerous just like the gunman.",

I\u2019ll keep it real simple so you understand. Australia has had a long history of strict bio security laws. Now, how is that relevant? Because we\u2019ve always been strict on what comes into this country. Covid came, and there were requirements for ALL travellers to quarantine for 14 days. This was happening in hotels but because a hotel is not really equipped to deal with quarantining people (ya know most don\u2019t have balconies and stuff), they used an old mining camp. I bet your mind is blown right? \nNow. The people who were in Howard springs were people who had travelled and were required to quarantine to ensure they weren\u2019t sick. 14 days was the quarantine period because that was the information being provided from the \u2018medical experts\u2019 at the time. This is no longer the case. \n\nI know plenty of people who have had Covid and weren\u2019t locked up. They stayed at home, rested, and got better. \n\n\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",

You really think a group of amateur gun owners with simplistic weaponry would have any chance against the military might of the US armed forces, even if it was reduced? What you shooting at a tank or any of the military related armored vehicles with guns bigger than most cars attached to them? You hold an AR-15 or any weapon you can legally own as a regular citizen up against one of the men or women in uniforms, you will automatically be transformed into either Swiss cheese or a pile of mush. It\u2019s ridiculous to think that having guns are in anyway helpful in combatting  government \u201ctyranny\u201d. Let\u2019s just use what you said as example, let\u2019s say we have another Covid situation and the military comes to your home to put you into some camp or force you into a hospital. Not your family, just you due to, idk, let\u2019s say your a carrier of Ebola. Are you going to take your gun and shoot at the military outside your door and win? Would you really put your family in that type of danger? What\u2019s the logic in this? But I digress, guns are not a right because their they\u2019re to defend against tyranny, they\u2019re just here due to cultural normality throughout US history. Theirs nothing wrong with that but it\u2019s a fucking dumb thing to think that they will be any help against the government.",

We had a massacre and in response the government had a buy back program through which you could surrender guns and get money for them. We did it happily as gun culture was never a thing here and mostly only farmers and collectors really had them. We don't live in fear to go grocery shopping and have very few gun incidents so have no desire to carry around AKs to starbucks.\n\n\nGuns are not illegal here, you may own them if 1, you pass a licencing test, 2 you have a valid reason for owning it (hunting, pest control, collectors etc) 3. You pass a criminal history check. The reason we don't have more guns is because we look at America and understand that that's not what we want to become.",

I\u2019m not a conservative either, i\u2019m a younger latino liberal guy. \nTo obtain my firearms I had to apply for a state license and pass a background check. To obtain any firearm I first need a background check and 3 day waiting period. To obtain some of the short barrel AR\u2019s I have, I had to get another background check, take a passport photo, fingerprints, and notify my local sheriff about it. Also we are not allowed to openly carry any firearms. Only concealed weapons are allowed, but only after taking a 16 hour course, shooting qualification, and another background check. There\u2019s also places we cannot carry. Schools, government buildings, hospitals, public transportation, some parks, and some restaurants. \nThe laws vary by states. \n\nAs an American who does not know anyone from Australia, I feel like one of the reasons we have such a problem with mass shootings is due to the low quality of life for the majority of Americans. We have awful schools, a lot of our inner cities are filled with heavy crime/gang activity, expensive universities, low wages, high costs of living, awful public transportation, ineffective police departments, police that fails to protect their citizens, a failed war on drugs, a prison system that punishes low level drug crimes, a justice system that set ups people who have committed crimes for failure with no second chances to reform, ridiculously high healthcare costs, and the inability to find professional mental help. The US does not have a social safety net for it\u2019s citizens. \n\nI have the firearms I have and carry/train with a firearm because I live in a fairly dangerous area. Multiple gang related homicides every week, shootings and multiple armed group break ins (3-4 people). I personally have had an attempted robbery on myself, a drive by shooting at my house, and have had a family member get shot due to them being in the wrong neighborhood. \nWhat is life like for those that live in strict gun control countries? Do you all have access more resources such as affordable medical care, affordable education, and low crime areas? If so do you feel like that better social welfare helps your country tremendously?\nI\u2019m tired of everything here being a Democrat vs Republican issue because nothings gets done. It\u2019s all done for social media clout and votes. \n\nI want a change in my country. I\u2019m willing to sit down and discuss how we can improve the gun issue in this country, but it seems like no one is willing to actually talk about we can fix the deep rooted issues we have here in the United States.",

Cost of living in certain parts of Australia can be quite high, with many people currently struggling to find housing due to costs and availability. There\u2019s certainly violence and high crime areas, and despite having strict gun laws there is still shootings here. The strict laws we have doesn\u2019t prevent people from getting guns but it does help ensure proper gun safety. Because at the moment, what is stopping someone getting a gun in a state with lax laws and then taking it somewhere else? The lack of social safety net is just the tip of the iceberg.",

There is a lot of laws already in place to prevent tragedies from happening but there is a lack of enforcement. A common thing that happens here in Chicago is people who are felons who are not able to legally own firearms, get caught with an illegal firearm, and eventually released within the week due to an already over capacity county jail. This is all happening in a city that had 797 homicides in 2021. \nI just hope that we are able to all work together to find solutions to these issues.",

In my eyes the people will always be more trustworthy than the few who want to control us. Recent events have occurred, both are reasons for and against gun ownership. Personally, I see both as a valid point for gun ownership. One one hand we just armed an entire country, on the other we have a mental health problem and guns are easy for bad people to acquire. Gun ownership is a right, and has been for a long time in this country, although if you're a felon or have significant mental health problems you aren't able to legally own a firearm. I'm all for reasonable discussions on this, and I do think we should have better ways of keeping guns out of the hands of criminals and psychos. But taking guns from law abiding and responsible gun owners is a stupid idea.",

In the US, guns are part of the culture, constitution is something most people are proud of (don\u2019t get why) and the constitution allows the people to have weapons. Children are raised in an environment where guns exist. Go to almost every single other country in the world that isn\u2019t poor, in war, or controlled by terrorist, and that isn\u2019t the case. We don\u2019t get taught about school shooting here outside of the US. People don\u2019t seek weapons and they are tought as terrible objects. Every single coutry has bad people and mentaly ill people or psychopath, yet not every country has mass shouting regularly; 256 this year just im the 5 first month of the year in the US. \n\nBut what about my freedom, my rights, the constitution: FUCK all those! If you have to take away some rights from your population to prevent kids from dying at school, do so! This is basically what we did during lockdown; take away our freedom to ensure the wellbeing of the population, and that is great. \n\nI am not gonna accuse people who disagree with me to be child murderer or a bad person, this would be hateful and doesn\u2019t help us having a rational discussion, just reconsider; is the right to having a gun really worth all these deaths?",

Even though most mass shootings take place in urban areas because there's more people (mass shooters looking to kill as many people as possible) - they STILL happen in rural areas, that's how bad this problem has gotten. They still happen in places with guards, the tops supermarket had an armed security guard at the door.\n\nGood guys with guns do not stop mass shootings, the more guns in circulation, the more mass shootings; this is a clear pattern. Even the cops cowered outside Robb elementary school due to the amount of firepower an 18 year old was able to legally and easily acquire with zero restrictions.\n\n> How can we improve safety, protect lives, reduce gun related crimes, all while allowing the law abiding citizen the right to keep/buy a firearm to protect himself/family?\n\nBanning certain kinds of weapons, setting higher age restrictions since most mass shootings are carried out by 14-24 year olds, waiting periods, national gun registry, stricter background checks, voluntary buybacks, red flag laws.\n\nAll these things still allow \"law abiding citizens\" to keep their weapons while preventing at least SOME of these incidents. The ones about the gun registry and stricter background checks (coupled with more gun store audits) would even help reduce the amount of illegal guns used by gangs, since a lot of these are obtained through illegal purchases that the stores claim as \"stolen\" and are just written off - this would discourage that practice by tracking exactly where these guns end up and if a single gun store becomes an apparent fountain source of illegal guns; they can be shut down.",

People in rural areas usually have guns and that dissuades people from doing bad things. Of course it won\u2019t stop everyone. Thank you for agreeing with me! Competent security, (people with guns), is effective. Maybe more guns isn\u2019t the answer but, I sleep soundly at night knowing if someone breaks in my home and wishes me or my family harm, whether they have a machete, a gun, or baseball bat, I can respond with deadly force and save my family. I will not hesitate to fight for my life and my family\u2019s lives. What have we learned? Criminals don\u2019t obey laws and no amount of laws will stop bad people from doing bad things. Even in days where there were not guns and swords were dominant, other people had swords to defend themselves from bad people with swords, commensurate with the threat. The 2nd Amendment protects my ability to defend myself. This utopia that you want and frankly that I want as well, will never exist in the real world. Every day people die from a plethora of things, life is not safe, we take risks every day with our lives, over 40,000 people die every year in car accidents, should we get rid of cars? We have traffic laws, why does that not stop car crashes? Because people disobey laws and some people don\u2019t care. That\u2019s why we look for danger and act accordingly. If all guns were made illegal would criminals still have them? Yes. How difficult would it be for armed criminals to fight off someone who doesn\u2019t have a gun? Very easily. I bet you all the money in the world that if an armed criminal broke into your home and you didn\u2019t have a gun because you turned in your gun because it was illegal, you\u2019d wish you had a gun to defend yourself and your family.

It's not an easy thing to just drive to the Northern Territory - Darwin it is 2860 km from Brisbane, over 4,000 km to Perth or over 3,000 km to Adelaide.\n\nYou didn't answer whether or not you thought guns on planes was a good idea.",

Now, you can come back and find an article that cherry picks certain parts of those stats and neutralizes them just as I can take in data that favors my opinion. In my experience, no one wants to try and beat you or take your stuff if you have a gun too. No one wants to die. Generally brandishing a weapon is like an ape beating its chest. The difference is that when someone of smaller stature brandishes a weapon with a would-be assailant, they\u2019re less likely to commit the crime regardless of stature. Idk about you but I would like to see a way for women to protect themselves reliably and not be told \u201cjust wait til it\u2019s over and maybe, if you survive the harrowing ordeal, you can go see the police and maybe, just maybe the justice system will prosecute them. If that goes through, maybe if they present a mountain of evidence and go through the degrading processes of having to be tested for semen, stds, etc it will be enough to convict the assailant... unless their rich, famous, or a politician. Then they\u2019re screwed. \n\nJust last week, everyone was talking about how ineffective the police are, now you\u2019re advocating for people to just rely on those same people?

      "text": "The American Left is going to lose and I don't mean just the gun debate, they may \"win\" that, but at a heavy cost.\n\nThere is an idea called the \"Four boxes of liberty\", which states:\n\n>There are four boxes to be used in the defense of liberty: soap, ballot, jury, and cartridge. Please use in that order.\n\nSo lets break it down.  First one, the \"soap box\", is about free speech, which includes the right to protest.  We saw protests a couple years ago in the aftermath of George Floyd's death, peaceful protests against police brutality that were met with more police brutality supported by the Right.  Even the president at the time (you know who) asked about using the military to shoot the protestors, much like China did in Tiananmen Square in 1989.  As far as I can tell, nothing changed.  There was a small organized group of peaceful BLM protestors that were carrying \"something\" other than signs, they weren't touched or assaulted by the police.  Care to guess?\n\nWell next comes the \"ballot box\", the right to vote.  Go out and vote, make your voice count!  Except it is getting harder and harder to do just that.  At this time, the Right (and yes, sometimes the Left) is actively attempting to gerrymander voting districts to weaken the Left's voting power and boost their own.  Even in cases where the Left does win the vote, we are now seeing a new tactic of the Right where they claim \"voter fraud\" in an attempt to change the election results against the will of the people.  There was an attempt during the 2020 Presidential Election and even resulted in the January 6th terrorist attack on the capital, but now they are planning to do it across the country.  They may not be successful in all of them, but a few is just the start.\n\nThe third is the \"jury box\" or the court system, used to interpret the law and help overturn unconstitutional laws or \"illegal laws\".  Except that has now been stacked by the Right with their own judges to impose their own agendas on all levels.  Just look at the Supreme Court's recent Roe v Wade brief that abortion rights may soon be taken away.  It sets a dangerous precedent where other rights that the Left supports may be taken away, such as LBGTQ rights and gay marriage.\n\nLastly, and to be used last, is the \"cartridge box\", also know as an ammunition box or gun rights.  The last tool to preserve Liberty, and the Left wants to give that up \"for a safe and secure society.\"\n\nSo we have one side that wants to control your voice, control your right to vote, have the courts rule in their favor and has the support of the police that will use violence to get their way.  \n\nAnd the other side wants to disarm.\n\nEven is a gun ban goes into effect, who is going to enforce it?  The police won't, or maybe they will just enforce it on those that don't have the same ideals as them.\n\nSo like I said, the American Left is going to lose, if they have not already lost.",

Australia is smack in the same category as other European countries, the effects are miniscule.\n\nAnd if we normalise by legal guns in the country, Australia is actually much, much, much, much, much worse.",

If kids were allowed to bring guns to school back in the fifties and forties for shooting class and didn't have an issue why do we now? Could it be because we rather just prescribed a toxic SSRI rather than figure out the root cause of a mental issue? Could it be because we stopped teaching the value of life? I bet it totally has nothing to do with the degradation of society..\n\n\nPS after 9/11 we made TSA security at airports more strenuous, after issues at concerts we created policies to prevent bags large enough to carry guns from being able to enter the venues, we put more security and police at higher chance areas like concerts, and so on. If we do all of that why have we still yet to put security in schools like we should? There's a plenty long enough list of loving caring and unemployed vets who are more than trained that would be more than willing to defend our kids. Fuck you and your gun control...

He had 40 rounds of ammo and 2 pistols with extra clips preloaded... Something changed, but it wasn't the availability of guns... Banning guns is a bandaid on a shark bite.   Personally I don't care if they are banned, I don't own one, but I don't think it will solve the root cause.",

This translates to 56,110 violent crimes prevented annually on the low scale. This also doesn't include property crimes which include home burglaries which increase that number to over 300,000 defensive gun uses between 2014 to 2016 or over 100,000 annually. This also doesn't include defensive gun uses that stopped a injury or death from an aggressive animal.\n\nThis ranges upwards to 500k to 3 million according to the [CDC Report Priorities for Research to Reduce the Threat of Firearm-Related Violence](http://www.nap.edu/read/18319/chapter/3). \n\nGovernment agencies from the CDC, BJS, and FBI have found:\n\n[\"Almost all national survey estimates indicate that defensive gun uses by victims are at least as common as offensive uses by criminals...\" & \" Studies that directly assessed the effect of actual defensive uses of guns, i.e., incidents in which a gun was \u201cused\u201d by the crime victim in the sense of attacking or threatening an offender, have found consistently lower injury rates among gun-using crime victims compared with victims who used other self-protective strategies...\"](http://www.nap.edu/read/18319/chapter/3).\n\n[\"A fifth of the victims defending themselves with a firearm suffered an injury, compared to almost half of those who defended themselves with weapons other than a firearm or who had no weapon.\"](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/ascii/hvfsdaft.txt)\n\n[According to the BJS from 2007-11 there were 235,700 violent crime victimizations where the victim used a firearm to defend themselves against their assailant.](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/fv9311.pdf)\n\n[The FBI Active Shooter Report for 2016 to 2017 specifically calls out multiple times an armed civilian stopped an Active Shooter.](https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/active-shooter-incidents-us-2016-2017.pdf/view)\n\nAlso while defensive gun use is common less than 0.4% of those uses result in a fatality.\n\nAlso bear in mind police have no legal duty to protect you. The job of law enforcement is to enforce laws, as they see fit. Multiple cases, up to the Supreme Court, have established that law enforcement has no duty to protect you.\n\n[Warren v DC](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_v._District_of_Columbia)\n\n[Castle Rock v Gonzalez](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_of_Castle_Rock_v._Gonzales)\n\n[DeShaney v Winnebago County](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeShaney_v._Winnebago_County)\n\n[Lozito v NY](http://decisions.courts.state.ny.us/fcas/fcas_docs/2013JUL/3001010882012002SCIV.pdf)\n\n[And most recently in the Parkland shooting.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/12/19/parkland-shooting-judge-school-cops-no-duty-protect-kids/2360683002/)\n\nThe whole to *\"protect and serve\"* [is just a slogan that came from a PR campaign](http://www.lapdonline.org/history_of_the_lapd/content_basic_view/1128).\n\nIf police do come when called the average\u00a0 response time is 11 to 18 minutes but can be up to 24 hours.\n\n[While the average police response time in America is 11 minutes it can take as long as 1 to 24 hours if they respond at all.](http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cvus/current/cv08107.pdf)\n\n[According to the National Sheriff's Association this average response time is longer at 18 minuets.](https://www.sheriffs.org/content/embracing-technology-decrease-law-enforcement-response-time)\n\nAnd we've had recent events such as the [national 911 outage](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/03/09/fcc-to-investigate-nationwide-911-outage/) Which can keep emergency services from even receiving your call for help.\n\nAdditionally in rural, and even urban communities, firearms are used to defend People, Pets, and Livestock from all manner of dangerous and invasive species ranging from feral dogs, coyotes, Bob cats, mountain lions, bears, and rabid animals.\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/progun/comments/kwclyf/indisputable_american_gun_violence_evidence/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share\n\nhttps://youtu.be/h5NU4wp4CZY \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/progun/comments/lkk4p6/are_you_liberal_leftleaning_a_democrat_etc_just/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share \n\nhttps://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-8.xls\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/fee.org/articles/guns-prevent-thousands-of-crimes-every-day-research-show/amp\n\nhttps://www.nraila.org/articles/20201005/fbi-2019-crime-data-released \n\nhttps://www.lawenforcementtoday.com/fbi-more-people-killed-with-knives-hammers-clubs-and-even-feet-than-rifles-in-2018/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Firearms/comments/mvf397/myanmar_protests_show_an_ar15_will_protect_a_lot/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share\n\nhttps://youtu.be/_aYNizuXu8c\n\nhttps://youtu.be/q6fNSGl2_tg \n\nhttps://youtu.be/asbE4dNSgigq\n\nhttps://wenstrup.house.gov/updates/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=399295 \n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/08/16/what-the-data-says-about-gun-deaths-in-the-u-s/%3famp=1 \n\nhttps://www.heritage.org/firearms/commentary/dont-count-american-compliance-gun-confiscation \n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_v._Heller\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/fee.org/articles/national-gun-registration-the-road-to-tyranny/amp\n\nhttps://youtu.be/PKCv6UUq9SI \n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/05/assault-weapons-ban-firearms-lifespan \n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2021/04/09/politics/biden-gun-control-executive-actions-speech-fact-check/index.html\n\nhttps://www.nraila.org/get-the-facts/what-is-the-charleston-loophole/\n\nhttps://azdailysun.com/news/opinion/mailbag/gun-ownership-kept-japanese-at-bay/article_234b2654-26c2-57ad-944f-7eef4efb0e29.html",

They gave civilians firearms to defend themselves and the country and they are winning.\n\nFrom my understanding, I believe that the civilians would definitely stand a chance only because most of our military would be on our side and disobey orders to kill neighbors.
