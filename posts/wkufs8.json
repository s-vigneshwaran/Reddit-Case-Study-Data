And so lesbians perform by also hooking up with men sometimes. But so you're suddenly an expert on LGBT people? Have you gotten a sexual history of every gay person you ever met to confirm your biases? How can you be sure there werent people that \"look straight\" to you that are actually gay and then did you verify they behave the way you want? \n\nIt seems like you guys have an assumption on what a gay person should like and then when you see those people you create a rigid guideline on how they should behave, and if they behave outside of those arbitrary rules then you think their labels aren't valid. \n\nSexuality is a spectrum and labels are not rigid things. Maybe they are bisexual and prefer another label. Maybe there is more going on. Its ultimately none of your business how we all perform our sexuality and it doesnt matter if someone doesnt \"look\" and \"perform\" in the way you want that label to behave.",

We\u2019re annoyed by the attention-seeking behavior involving labels and flags and new terms to describe who specifically you want to fuck.  Keep that shit to yourself if you don\u2019t want feedback.\n\nIt\u2019s like calling out for work-  the more information you provide to your employer the more you\u2019re implicitly asking for their judgment on your decision to call out.

He\u2019s probably in the closet\u201d. Both sides pull this crap. \n\nComp het is also dumb because in their own community gay and lesbians ridicule and mock bi people for being sluts or liars.

She was petite and feminine, highly prized among the gays in our city, and the thought of her lezzing out was admittedly sexy, but I couldn't allow myself to proposition her for I would never lay with such a corrupted creature.

It is actively trans-exclusionary and misunderstands gender identity, genital preferences and their validity, and what a sexual orientation is. People who hang up the \"superstraight\" flag don't do so because they think it's a valid sexual orientation, they do so to make a mockery of the LGBTQ+ people. \nSimilar to how people hanging up the confederate flag don't do so because they legitimately identify with the confederacy as a nation (most of them couldn't even tell you, which states belonged to it), but because they believe in values the confederacy held up, namely deeply racist beliefs. Hence, why they are bigots.",
