His cheeto-stained fingers cannot move fast enough. He has only one humble goal; you know, just to save the entire world is all.\n\n>Every little arrow he sees glows blue, the most sensual color he's ever seen. Blue, like hope, so elusive yet so tender with the promise of a better world.\n\n>He sees a red, glowing arrow and jolts back in his chair.\n\n>Red. The color of blood and lies.\n\n>In his flurry, he's made a monumental mistake. The fate of all men has been compromised.\n\n>\"The foiiiiiids, They'll know!\"\n\n>He quickly corrects his mistake, and the comforting essence of watery blue returns. For now, the world is safe.\n\nThis is the kind of misandry and hateful stereotyping we call out... and they praise each other for it.\n\nThey really have a serious mental disconnection with misandry and misogyny. How do they not realize they are exactly the thing they claim to decry? You would think their overweight problem glasses red haired selves would put down the Dorito's and dildo's to think for a second but maybe the hair dye has soaked their poor dried up brains too much.\n\nSee, I can do it too. Isn't this fun? I sound like them! The hypocritical morons they are... tsk tsk.\n\nEdit: And the comment is deleted and the post is locked. Did they get admonished? We'll never know, they'd never admit it.",
