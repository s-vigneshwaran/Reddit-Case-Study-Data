I immediately realized what happened. My son's daycare celebrated Hannukah last week by coloring menorahs and making dreidels and he was curious about Jewish people.\n\nTLDR: My son asked about Jewish people, but I thought he said \"jealous\" people and I explained how greedy those people are.",

The doll was African-American (also important to the story) so she asked her mom if she could get it and her mom said \u201cugh, it\u2019s so expensive.\u201d The doll was like the Target version of an American Girl doll and it was VERY expensive. She relented and told her daughter she could have it. At the checkout her daughter handed the cashier the doll and told her \u201cmy mom let me have this doll even though it\u2019s offensive.\u201d My friend\u2019s actual soul left her body she was that mortified. Expensive, her daughter meant expensive.",

And here we are on a date driving past a BJs when my stupid naive brain decides to declare, \u201coh you know what\u2019s great about BJs\u2026\u201d\n\nInstant regret. He turned to look at me with the biggest smile on his face and said \u201cwow, please tell me\u201d. \n\nI couldn\u2019t do anything but laugh and try and explain what I really meant (which he knew) but it was somewhat of an ice breaker and now it\u2019s almost 20 years later and I\u2019ve never forgotten that.",

Every page had a different theme, and was meant to portray a different part of Sticker World. \n\nAnyway, one day my mom discovered that there was a penny candy store not too far from our house, and she got really excited because that was a thing when she was younger. So she took us to get some candy. A lot of the penny candy was completely new to us, and my sister decided to immortalize the experience within Sticker World. She taped the candy wrappers to a page of her notebook and called it \"Sticker World Wrappers.\" Only, she spelled it \"Sicker World Rapers.\"\n\nHere's the thing: The year prior, my mom had had The Talk with me, and she gave me an excellent book by Dr Ruth that explained puberty and sex. The book went a few steps further and explained things like different sexual orientations, masturbation, and sexual crimes. Thanks to that book, I now knew what rape meant. I also knew that my sister had no clue and she wasn't old enough to understand. So I tried to gently tell her, \"Uh sis, you spelled wrappers wrong, you might want to correct that,\" but because I couldn't tell her exactly why she needed to correct it she stuck to her guns. Sicker World Rapers still exists to this day, and is somewhere in the world!",

I have issues with it, b/c not every family can afford to \"donate\" just so their kid can wear something fun to school and kids end up being left out, but I digress. \n\nAnyway, I was friends with the school secretary and had gotten to know my son's kindy teacher throughout the year. I get a phone call from the school about an hour after school starts. Secretary is laughing so hard she can barely breathe as she tells me that a  3rd-grade student had come into the office all upset telling her that one of the kindergarten kids had shown him a bunch of quarters and told him it was **his stripper money**. (For context, pre-covid, there were more than a few strip clubs in our county, and several were along the two-mile stretch where the high, middle, intermediate, and primary schools are located. Thanks, super lax zoning laws!) \n\nThe child was super worried and the secretary asked if he could tell her who the kid was. The child didn't know my son's name, but he had a very distinctive hairstyle at the time so they figured it out pretty quickly. She called his teacher and told her and they had a good laugh. My kid had a lisp back then and was super excited he was going to be allowed to wear slippers in class that day.  We were a bit concerned about the 3rd-grader who already knew about \"stripper money\" though.",

My brother in law complained about something and my 5 year old daughter piped up \u201cit\u2019s probably those damn Jews\u201d.

Because it requires cooler temperatures, that method of drying doesn't work well further south. \n\nOf course, that still doesn't explain the lye \ud83e\udd14 I mean, stockfish was a big export.

I toned that all way down to use \"all the spices\" (salt -and- pepper) then slowly built from there.\n\nAs far as I can tell NE Polish food is a cuisine developed in poverty and the jewish food from that area is the same but with a bunch of rules thrown on top making things even harder. Top of my head Ashkenazi is from around there in the \"jews are allowed border\" area that russia made.\n\nWithout bacon / kielbasa so much Polish food becomes quite arguably meh.",

I put beef cubes in my kasha because it is crap without it. Then sour cream.\n\n(No idea what american \"poles\" think though - could be very different)",

                  "text": "It all depends on your taste and the presentation of the food at your introduction to it.  There are definitely dishes in the catalogue of Ashkenazi food that were developed to make the most of what was available (any society that experiences privation will have that).  We certainly have a lacrimose history, but it's not entirely so and there is a lot of flavor to be found, both culturally and in the cuisine.  Unfortunately, a lot of us experience more of the neuroses and poorly made food, so that's what we receive.  In an effort to defend at least the cuisine, I submit the following:\nMatzah is great with cream cheese or butter or as matzah brie (especially if you use Manischewitz Everything matzah; I cannot recommend this highly enough).  The brand also matters: Yehuda matzah is very good all around, others can really be quite bland.  If you're a kid and all your siblings and cousins are like \"durrrrr cardboard\" it can ruin the experience.\nHorseradish: it really depends on how much you like spicy food or other strong flavors.  My grandpa used to make his own for seders and it was hot and you could feel the burn in the back of your head.  Unfortunately, he hadn't taken a maror apprentice before he died.  If you are introduced with some jarred beet-colored vinegar-adulterated horseradish, it will be bland and it doesn't have anything to recommend it.  If you don't like it, fine!  Totally fine.  Use romaine lettuce for maror.\nGefilte fish: this is a tough one.  If you bought a few jars or -choke- cans and went back in time to the Lower East Side and tried to serve that at shul, yeah, no one there would like it either.  That stuff is not good and I don't know how it sells.  And don't get me started on the jelly: there is no reason for it and no one should ever see it or eat it.  There has been one jarred gefilte fish that I've liked; the rest have not been fun.  If you want to have real gefilte fish, you want homemade.  You take some whitefish and salmon, you grind it up with some garlic, salt, and dill.  Dice some shallots and mix them in.  Put in a loaf pan, top with some smoked paprika and sumac, and BAKE, don't boil (or you can boil, though I don't know if there's a separate way to prep for boiling).  It's way better and actually has flavor and character.  It's how gefilte fish was meant to be made and it would make your bubbe proud.\nLiver: divisive; either you like it or you don't.  My recommendation would be to get some from a good deli or deli counter.  Serve on some rye or black bread with a wedge of tomato.\nP'chaw: no comment.  My grandmother remembers it from when she was young and it was not a fond memory.  I've never had it but I want to try it just for the sake of trying it.  I'm sure it can be made well, but it was definitely one of those things we ate for the protein.\nCholent: generally good, but can be really good or really bad.  Essentially slow cooked beef stew.  I haven't made it in years but it was very well reviewed.  I used a lot of meat and potatoes; flavored with spices and sauces; no barley, yes chick peas; and kishke.\n\nBone apple tea!",

Getting a bit uncomfortable in this following part: >!In Jewish history, especially within the Levant, any community that grows too large or too autonomous would usually end up being purged by its neighboring Arabs, Druze, or Turks. The notion of a peaceful coexistence prior to the 20th century is entirely a myth.!<\n\n>!Hebron and Tiberias suffered similar fates, and the apartheid system of Ottoman governance typically softlocked Jews out of Jerusalem by banning them from owning land entirely, with the occasional period of just straight up saying that Jews aren't allowed to live there. Practices like these, as well as pogroms and humiliations, continued right up into the 20th century, when the government was approving new houses be built in front of the Western Wall to block its access, and Jews visiting it were frequently subject to beatings and/or having dung or human waste thrown at them. Chants of \"Jews are our dogs\" were widespread through the 1920s.!<\n\n>!This is just kinda how it is. Nothing about the tribal identity of the Jews would be respected, not the sanctity of land, nor their philosophy, nor their right to live at all. After all the cruelty the Romans had inflicted, all the violations, there was a hope when the Caliph's armies took the cities. A hope that was crushed when \"People of the Book\" became, in practical terms, a status of being subhuman. When Dhimmi status became less tolerance and acceptance, and more of an extortion racket. When mosques were built on top of Jewish holy places, and Jews were banned from visiting them at all thereafter. When new clans were invited to fill the places where Jews were being pushed out of, until the population of Jews who had never left at all was pushed to just Galilean Jews, and when those were reduced to basically just Peqi'in after the Crusaders committed wholesale slaughter. Saladin was another glimmer of hope, great he was, but that was only temporary until the Mamlukes took over and did just about everyone dirty. In the transition from Mamluke to Ottoman power, local warlords took the chance to slaughter Jews en masse, and the new Ottoman authorities did not last a century before falling into the same patterns of apathy at best, apartheid on average, and genocide at worst. It's one of the world's oldest, longest colonialist narratives.!<",

I don\u2019t see the point in trying to stop them from discovering \u201cbad words\u201d, and it\u2019s the very fact that we make it taboo that makes it fun for kids to misuse profanity once they discover it.\n\nEdit: I should probably mention that I\u2019m only referring to profanity like \u201cfuck\u201d and \u201cshit\u201d. Slurs and targeted hate are a whole other matter.",

Like a kid should be scolded for using profanity in a way that could hurt others, but I wouldn\u2019t scold my kid just for saying the word \u201cfuck\u201d if it makes sense in context.

It was ludicrous. He had to rent a truck to transport it from the post office to the dorm, and we had to clear out a closet on the first floor to store it all. We held it for people who really wanted to use it to celebrate the holiday, but I don\u2019t think there were many Jewish people, and the student who received it all just told us to let anyone take it for snacks or whatever.",

I told my friend that his \u201ci\u201d\u2019s were wrong bc it didn\u2019t look like the cursive \u201ci\u201d I learned from my mom.  We argued about it a bit before he became so upset and told the teacher that I kept telling him his \u201ci\u201d\u2019s were wrong.  The teacher immediately put me in time out and set up a parent-teacher conference w/ my mom and I after school.  I really didn\u2019t see what the big deal was; i hadn\u2019t teased him, we just disagreed on a letter.  Until years later my mom told me that my teacher thought I was making fun of my friend\u2019s EYES.  She thought I told my Asian friend that his eyes were wrong.",

      "text": "This is one of the better stories to come out of my slow pitch league.\n\nI've been the pitcher for my mixed gender slow pitch league for a few years. I know most of the people in the league and generally joke around a lot while playing the game.\n\nIm not very competitive so I'm known for pitching a lot of 'melons'. Melons are slow moving easy to hit pitches straight down onto the center of the plate. They keep the game moving and allow everybody to play. At some point I started calling these watermelons. This will become relevant later in the story.\n\nSo anyways... I'm pitching a game against one of my friend's teams and this big, strong, athletically built man comes up to bat. I usually pitch harder for players like this because they can easily hit it out of the park. I send two trash pitches and can tell he's not too happy.\n\n\"I'll give you one nice one and that's all you get!\"\n\nSo I send him a patented Kosnov watermelon straight down the plate and he crushes this ball so far out that it goes into another ball diamond further out from us.\n\nThe game continues and in a later inning, this same guy comes up to bat again. Queue the garbage pitches. I send three balls and he doesn't swing. I figure if I throw one more ball, he'll be walking anyway and it IS just a fun league, so I send another watermelon.\nBoom.\n\nCrushes this ball directly into the neighboring ball diamond again. I'm impressed and I loudly exclaim \"No more watermelons for that guy!\"\nThe issue here is... The guy crushing these balls out if the park was black. I didn't even think about what I said until it was too late. \n\nAnother person from their dugout yells back at me \"What the fuck man???\"\nEverybody who knows me knows that in no way did I mean anything by it but I had to spend the rest of the game throwing everyone watermelons to make sure people understood.\n\nTLDR: Told a black man he couldn't have any more watermelons while playing baseball. Probably marked as a crazy racist for the remainder of my ball career.\n\nEdit: Formatting",

After some stumbling verbal evasion and then some internal searching for the words to use, she found a relatively age-appropriate way to tell me that it meant to have sex.\n\n\"Oh,\" I said. \"Ok...\" And I paused, gears churning for a moment. Then I asked a followup question:\n\n\"Do people really do...*that*, at work, so much?\"\n\nShe seemed baffled, said no, and told me she wondered why I asked that.\n\nI said something like \"I keep seeing stories on TV where someone is at work and the boss yells \"do a better job or you're gonna be laid!\" Or someone comes home from work really angrily yelling \"I got laid today!!\" or is instead just really sad about it having happened...\"\n\nMy mom became more pale, and more tense, while I was telling her the above answer, and by the time I finished saying it, she seemed to be feeling some kind of shock at realizing what had just happened. She just sat still and processed for a moment, then slowly turned to me, and said \"...did you mean, '*getting laid off*'??\n\nCompletely oblivious to her suddenly dying inside, I replied excitedly \"*Oh right, that's what it was*! Laid Off! Yeah I forgot part of it! Haha. So, what *does* \"getting laid off\" mean?\n\nShe told me, in a flat, expressionless tone. (Basically it means getting fired from work.)\n\n(I thanked her! Also told her that question had been stuck in my head for a while; characters talking about \"getting laid off\" appear  in so many movies and TV shows; not knowing what it meant was getting frustrating!\n\nShe said \"you're welcome\". And then she said she needed a nap and went to her bedroom. \ud83d\ude05 )",

We were both super liberal and Obama fans, but this was in Georgia. \nAnyway I think we got into the topic of Nader and how he was going to ruin the election. We were reported to the teacher for saying something racist and talked to after class. \nThe teacher said something along the lines that two of the black students in the class said we they heard us say that no one would ever vote a black person president. We vehemently denied this, and mentioned we were in fact campaigning for Obama. I remembered the students were crying that day in class and didn\u2019t realize it had anything to do with us. Anyway we were dismissed and the next day in class it dawned on me what must have happened. They must have heard us say that no one would ever vote a n-word president. When we actually said no one would ever vote Nader for president. No wonder they had cried. I felt awful and told my friend, and she just brought it up to them like \u201cwe said Nader, not the n-word get your facts straight\u201d. I felt horrible. Like have some empathy. I apologized to the two girls after class as best I could, but I still feel terrible to this day over the whole situation.",

He turns around and looks at me with a 'wtf' sort of expression on his face, understandably so, and looks back at her asking, \"He told you that??\" I have a brief moment of panic and confusion, as I have not interacted with this girl at all, much less introduced her to derogatory slurs... She says, \"no, it's up on the board\" pointing back up at a chalkboard that is on the wall behind me that lists our daily specials. We had a fish and chips special that day with Alaskan Pollock. The relief was apparent on both of our faces and we shared a laugh as he explained (with the correct pronunciation)  that it is a type of fish.

Luckily, I heard the word on the television once and was smart enough at that age to put 2 and 2 together, and realize I\u2019d made a mistake.
