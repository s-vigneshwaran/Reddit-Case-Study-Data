Like I hope the person is okay and gets help but at the same time fuck that person because they've altered the day of tens if not hundreds of people. Strictly from an economical stand point, that's significantly costly.\n\nIn the last 5 years I've been late to work three times. Two of those times were due to a totally avoidable car accident. The company I worked for was solid and still comped all of the hourly wage employees. And there was at least 15 of us late due to this accident. That was a couple thousand dollars didn't need to be spent. On top of that the 15 employees waiting for the day shift to show up were paid overtime. Not saying that this is what happened in this scenario, just an alternative viewpoint.",

As an example, imagine you get in a fight with your significant other before you go to work.  Somebody cuts you off in traffic on the way.\n\nA person with a high EQ would be able to separate those two events and deal with them distinctly and rationally.\n\nA person with a low EQ would combine the two completely unrelated events and have an irrational response that would likely become self-destructive.\n\nIn context with this post, the cop does not show the emotional intelligence to see the greater benefit to society would be to allow the firefighter to continue because he can't see past the perceived disrespect. \n\nIt's a fairly new concept but Google it a bit, I think it's fascinating.",

And it's pretty strict criteria as well, which you'd know if you did research.  Things such as suicide by cop, when the criminal has a gun or other weapon etc. \n\nAnd stopping people with guns, preventing domestic violence, aggravated assaults, attempted murder. Those are hardly \"non events\" and its disgusting that you care so little for the regard of others lives that you're willingly ignorant to all the good police do.  \n\nA little fact for you. There are 259 million police contacts per year in the USA. There are 1000 people die per year by police (this is even including self defense, suicide by cop etc).  So that's a 0.00038% chance of dying to police per contact.  So a 99.998% success rate and you're trying to say its an evil machine.

Some traffic cop coming on shift on his motorcycle rode trying swing dick yelling about all the traffic and to get it moving, to which I said that\u2019s a bad fucking idea here, and this tow truck needs the room but he insisted so I backed off, give it like 45 seconds and a car fucking clipped the tow truck and he realized how fucking stupid it was and closed it down.

No discipline was made public although a higher up in CHP did admit they should strive to work with fire better in the future or something.\n\nThe firefighter spent 30 minutes in cuffs and then was released, no charges filed and wasn't transported to jail or anything.\n\n*Technically* CHP has authority on freeway crash scenes although incident command usually goes to the fire captain on scene. If CHP did anything to punish the officer, it probably wouldn't be made public as they don't want to admit that they aren't in control of the freeways, which is kinda their whole domain. But no one has ever actually arrested a firefighter on scene over parking before so I doubt anyone felt any rules needed to be made about the whole deal.\n\nGenerally just a bunch of fucking nonsense. I do hope the officer got in some sort of trouble that wasn't made public, but I have no way to know honestly. I'd imagine not now, from the looks of it, although he probably went on his supervisor's radar in the worst way possible for the next few years after that.",

A wash board dirt road and and 6 teens crammed into a small hatchback Camero. \n\nThree firefighters, one paramedic and one EMT, three cops.\n\nWe get there first, start triage and patient care.  Cops arrive next and block the ambulance from getting any closer.  Ambulance forced to park over 50 yards down the road.  \n\nCops are just standing there. Hands in their pockets. \n\nOne kid has a brain bleed and become combative. Punches a female firefighter. Cops hands stays in his pockets. Myself and the EMT wrestle the kid down. Tied his hands with gauze and strapped him to a back board. Paramedic gave him the good drugs and he settled down while waiting on a helicopter. \n\nSecond ambulance arrives. 65 yards away.  Had to run all the way back and forth for supplies, C-collars, backboards, etc.  While wearing turnouts. \n\nWhen triaging, I (as the senior guy of the first arriving crew) had to make the call to decide who we worked on first. I assumed a girl was dead at first glance, and we moved on the help the other 5.  3 people can only do so much. If the useless cops had lifted a finger to help with the combative patient, myself and the EMT could have got to that girl 20 minutes sooner.  She made it, but she was unresponsive the entire time. That's been 10 years ago, and I'm still pissed just thinking about it.",

Its \"annoying\" when you're stuck in traffic because of an accident. But its 100% understandable when shit gets blocked off for emergency crews (unless you're a sociopath). Putting up an impenetrable blinky weewoo fortress keeps everyone as safe as possible. A tired commuter barreling down the highway and swerving into a rescue operation can kill multiple people.\n\nYes. The cops should be there to control the situation. But the other emergency crews are there to do their job too. Fucking work as a team. Its not like the firefighters are blasting the cops with hoses and chopping at them with axes because *they're* not cooperating.",

On average, id say close to half of each video is spent on screenshots of actual case precedent, study and law. They give letter grades to all parties involved for how closelely they followed the law or common sense and explain what they did wrong or right. It is extremely thorough, i cant express that enough.\n\nEdit: i just learned a lot about the legality of owning a firearm from the \"police arrest an ATF agent\" video. Also that the police dont seize illegally owned weapons, the federal agents from the alcohol tobacco and firearms department comes to your house for that",

And under any doubt you should obey what they say. So technically yes. But just like to search your car a cop requires reasonable justification to ask you to leave your vehicle. And you should roll up your window and lock your car unless they already have permission to search after you leave your vehicle. You leaving does not provide permission.\n\nIf the cop does not answer with I feel unsafe continuing this traffic stop with you in the vehicle then they may not be able to remove you from the vehicle. Or some variation of the answer it doesnt necessary mean they feel in danger. They could be worried you or other pedestrians or police are in danger. And obviously they can remove you for any detainable offense.\n\nedit: not a lawyer and its different depending on the state or country. Some states are more lax than others.",

Its pretty blatant discrimination.\n\nedit: they could have also asked to inspect the firearm and relevant permits which would have removed the danger of the firearm. They are allowed to inspect the firearm to make sure it is within legal specifications like barrel length or modifications etc or to make sure he is the legal owner.

This is true for both the passenger and the phone conversation.\n\nOne key difference, though, is that the passenger is also situationally aware of the car's surroundings (and is also likely a driver themselves), so it's easier to adjust the flow of the conversation and slow it down or pause it altogether when needed. So if the driver needs to maneuver through a tricky situation on the road, the passenger usually shuts up for a few seconds and conversation resumes once the maneuver is completed. A passenger that knows you are looking for something (an address, an exit, etc.) can also look for it with you, which compensates a little for the distraction the conversation is causing in the first place.\n\nOn the other hand, someone on the phone doesn't see what's happening, and thus will continue the conversation throughout the maneuvers. That study also showed that drivers talking on the phone tended to talk more (in terms of words per minute) during difficult maneuvers, which they believe is a way to remain in control of the conversation and reduce the amount of incoming information to process. It's still less efficient than talking to a passenger that can react properly to the car's surroundings, however.",

And says she's waiting for back up. 5 cars roll in one after another, one dude comes out packing a shot gun, asks the 1st cop if her dog would be ready to go in. But thankfully she had the sense to be like, nah he's a pup and still has his balls, he's super aggressive and hasn't had enough training yet or something to that effect. And before entering all of them drew weapons. Kid must have been 14-17 years old un armed just being stupid. Thankfully while they were all having a powwow up front the kids got out through a back door and split. It just blew my mind like, how people could come out ready for war when they were called in to deal with a minor.",

Then I had to remind her my wife is an immigrant, and we'll be having mixed race babies that will have to grow up likely being the only non-white kid in their classroom. It's pretty terrifying to think about.\n\nBut of course my situation is somehow different and \"those people\" at the border are dangerous but my wife is fine since she come from a more acceptable country and married a white man.",

Also, because using violence is not allowed, they should get special rules which enables them to use violence but only in certain situations when said violence is necesary. Also, when they confront aomeone who has violated the laws we should enable this new organisation to detain them so that they can get prosecuted and punished for the violation.\n\nSound good?",

Turned out they were just creating a dangerous and distracting traffic hazard to camp a hill and laser people.\n\nSo of course they ticketed me for briefly speeding up to get out of their way for their safety, and not the girl next to me who was speeding and driving in two lanes looking down at her phone in her lap that wouldn't let me over.",

Went into court with dash cam footage of both the erratic driver next to me and the dangerous area the cops were parked, with hardcoded speed data. They refused to even look at it. The prosecutor called a private audience after my statement to berate me for wasting her and the officer's time, and then begrudgingly offered me a plea for a lesser charge. I just played the whole thing really dumb and innocent and when the judge came back repeated everything the prosecutor said to me and kept asking questions to \"waste their time\" as much as possible. (I had also used all my available reschedules.) Then set up a payment plan for the charges.\n\nI knew what I was in for, and made that clear. The apologetic and innocent, friendly \"let me explain why this was necessary\" approach with a peppered in \"I am aware that justice is not going to be served here\" undertone.\n\nI've been fighting tickets all my life. I used to have great success. Even when I was actually in the wrong (which is rare, I've just lived in places where if you travel on certain roads enough in a car that is old enough you're guaranteed to get bs tickets pretty regularly. Poor cities that rely on the income. It was common for people to have a display wall of tickets in their home at one of those places.)\n\nI've found that over the last 10 years many municipalities have completely dropped any effort at keeping up appearances and will not drop a charge for any reason. I once tried to fight a seatbelt ticket that was not fully filled out, by an officer who was out of his jurisdiction, who pulled me over because I was in my wife's car who he was harassing, pulling over her car any time he saw it. The ticket information was wrong, I was wearing a seatbelt, I brought in irrefutable proof that there was no possible way he could have even seen if I was or not when he started pursuing me. Still didn't get dropped.\n\nGot another ticket from that same cop for speeding in a school zone while I was sitting at a redlight. Ticket info was also wrong. Had the name of a street 2 blocks past where I was stopped, which wasn't even in the schoolzone anymore (its a one block school zone with a stop light in the middle, pretty hard to hit 35 there.) He didn't show up to court, and the judge refused to drop it and made me come back again.\n\nAlso got a ticket for speeding while driving a cab, by a tiny little douchebag that was a campus security guard who got turned into a \"cop\" by a really dumb vote to make campus security an official police department with ill defined jurisdiction. In a different city than the college. With multiple sources of recorded data of my speed (it's a heavily monitored cab) proving he was full of shit. Didn't get dropped.\n\nInterestingly that guy also pulled a gun on me another time for standing in a parking lot across the street from where he was harassing some kid. Yelling \"you can't stand there\" while I lit a cigarette and very definitely stood there. Saw him a few other times body slamming drunk college girls outside of bars down town for seemingly little reason.\n\nThe other guy also tackled a college kid for \"resisting arrest\" for \"public drunkenness\" while drinking on his front porch. Then sued the kid because he sprained his little wrist tackling him. Oh he also had some paid leave for fatally shooting an unarmed man while he was holding his toddler in his own home, the man had called the police to report a domestic dispute and his wife left before the cops arrived. The officer was told not to enter until backup arrived and went in alone anyways, then came out with a story about how the guy \"pointed a (non-existent) gun at him.\"\n\nI still have a warrant out in a bumfuck town far away for being pulled over because my plates came back as a different car. I showed him my registration and he ran the plates again and it came back as yet a different car, each time he ran it. Something wrong with the computer I guess. He said \"I've already started writing the ticket so I'm just going to put headlight out and you can have it dropped\" but guess what? They wouldn't drop it and he wouldn't show up. So I refused to pay it.\n\nThese mfers just do whatever they want and the court makes no effort to hide that it's a revenue machine. If I could afford to hire a lawyer or demand trial in places where it's even allowed I would. But I just suffice for getting some entertainment out of going in to court and fucking with them. Get my couple hundred bucks worth of fun out of it yaknow?\n\nFortunately I rarely get tickets any more since I've been able to afford newer cars. You almost never get pulled over in a car less than 8 years old unless you're actually fucking up. But alas my vehicle is rapidly approaching the 10 year old mark and car prices are insane right now, so I've seen a few more officers than I care to over the last year.",

She was being harassed by a police officer, who has a recorded history of harassing women. He's the only cop that ever pulled either of us over in the 8 years we lived there. In fact I was pretty friendly with most of the officers in my area due to my job. I only got pulled over by him in her car. Never when breaking any laws.\n\nI have broken laws. Everyone does. I did it a lot as a teenager. Got away with a lot. I'm a very responsible driver as an adult because 1. Lots of experience and 2. It's how I earn a living. I very rarely go more than 10 over and if I do it's very briefly and for a safety concern. I stay in the right lane except to pass. I always signal. I avoid wrecks so well that it's a detriment because I'd really benefit from someone hitting my car right now lol, and work driving all day in an area that has multiple wrecks every day, but I just can't seem to not avoid getting hit.\n\nThe point of the topic at hand is not \"here's everything I've ever done, you judge.\" It was about how traffic enforcement works and why, and the level of complacent corruption in it. Relating back to the point that illegal window tint is almost never the real reason for a traffic stop, but is only brought up when it can be an added charge (as many charges as possible helps reduce the likelihood of all charges being dropped) or as an excuse to pull someone over and search for something else to charge them with. **Edit: whoops wrong thread. This was about cops creating traffic hazards and then ticketing people for reacting to them. My b.***\n\nI just shared a few of the wilder anecdotes I have. Which I'm sure many people, especially those with a lot of miles under their belt, can relate to. Gotta love the people who haven't even driven 100k miles in their life trying to compare time frames like it's a more valuable metric than time spent on the road.",

Was it not long enough?\n\nI can add irrelevant info to pad it out:\n\nI once got ticketed for 84 in a 55 (i was going at least 95, but that would be a felony so he wrote it for the max non-felony speed.) With a car full of people on ecstasy. I was sober. I got out of it by claiming I had no idea what all these weirdos were doing but they were scaring me and I had offered to give them a ride but wanted them out of my car asap as it was late and I had to be up early to lead my church youth group. The truth is we forgot some drugs at the dealer's house and didn't realize til we got to the party so I was flying back to grab them. Totally in the wrong and breaking many laws.\n\nI also got ticketed for illegal street racing when I was illegally street racing. Took a driving safety course (which they let me do despite the fact that I was a driving instructor lol) and got it dropped. (For anyone concerned it was a very safe setup at an abandoned parking lot in the middle of nowhere where car enthusiasts have been going to race at night for decades. I never did that shit on public roads.)\n\nI got ticketed numerous times for lack of insurance, and just went in to court with some insurance papers I printed out from microsoft word and got them dropped. Can't get away with that anymore I don't reckon. But I also haven't driven uninsured in my adult life so idk.\n\nI didn't see the need to add another several paragraphs to an already obnoxiously long comment just to preemptively assuage the inevitable \"if you got in trouble you must be a bad person\" comments. But there's some guilt admission, unrelated to the topic of for-profit penal fines baked into city budgets and the difficulty of fighting them even with plentiful proof, to satiate your appetite for longer comments.\n\nI've also done plenty of illegal shit I didn't get pulled over for. But yes the vast majority of times I've been pulled over it was bullshit. Most of my speeding tickets have been from one place where the only way to get between two cities I had to commute through was a highway that passed through \"the most corrupt law enforcement in the country\" and if you ride through there enough times you're gonna get a ticket. 84 in a 65 in a car that had a top speed of 72. Pedal to the floor, downhill, maybe 73. I asked the judge to come outside and get the car to 84. Offered to pay 3x the fine if anyone could get my car over 80. They weren't interested.\n\nI too have heard \"if everyone else is always the asshole\" all my life. Usually from assholes. It's a dismissive and ignorant bumper sticker wisdom slogan that appeals to the stupid and oblivious who are completely blind to the fact that they're accusing others of exactly what they're doing.\n\nIf you don't believe that there are places where being poor or not white are all the cause required to be railroaded by the legal system on a daily basis, then you're very fortunate, and very uneducated. Try driving around, completely legally, following all rules of the road to a t, in a 15+ year old car with paint damage. Especially in a suburban southeastern town neighboring a major city. See how many times you get told your tail light is out...",

Any car out after 10pm anywhere near the border was gonna get pulled over. It was a very boring place to live so some nights we'd go cross the city line to get beer and drive back just to waste time fucking with the cops. We were completely clean and legal of course, but sometimes we'd put weird shit in the car just to mess with them. Or pretend to throw shit off to the side of the road and watch them hunt for it.\n\nOne time I had a bunch of gas masks in the car and he asked what they were for. I said \"swine flu\" and he said that a gas mask would not protect you from swine flu. I was having a laugh but also like... Wasn't sure if he was kidding. So I was explaining NBC filters and shit and he got really upset and put his hand on his sidearm and screamed \"A GAS MASK WILL NOT PROTECT YOU FROM SWINE FLU!\" so I immediately backed off.\n\nIt got to a point where we got pulled over by the same 2 cops so many times, and each time they'd switch up who was good cop and who was bad cop. They finally started remembering us and we'd chat about Metallica and Guitar Hero and shit while they toss the car.\n\nWeird way to entertain yourself in retrospect but god damn it's boring in a sundown town.\n\nNot enough windshield wiper fluid is a new one to me lol. That's creative.",

I have a similar story, we were headed to mates place on a Saturday afternoon. Got pulled over but the same cops, as per most Saturdays, said they had a report of 3 kids doing drugs somewhere. Picked the car apart and the cop holds up something he got from the glove box. Gave us \u201cone last chance to come clean\u201d my mate tells him it\u2019s opera glasses. Looking smug he asks \u201cis that you final answer?\u201d Yeah bro. \nHe pulled out opera glasses.\nOne of the mates we had with us was the son of the big boss cop of our region. We still got pulled up but they didn\u2019t search the car again.\n\n\nAlso the fine for no fluid was $80 it\u2019s now $120 according to my cop friend",

Kinda pissed at myself that it just slipped out like that. But it was funny to me because I almost always signal to exit a traffic circle, and often get made fun of for it, but I'm a stickler for the rules.\n\nThis was barely a roundabout. It was one of those little circles they drop in neighborhood roads instead of speedbumps and there was no intersecting road. And we were the only two cars anywhere around. Me driving and her parked in the bushes lol. When I got the usual inappropriate line of questioning about where I'm going and coming from told her I was working and pointed to my dominos uniform and hotbag. She wanted to look inside the bag, threatened to go to dominos and ask them if I worked there, all because I didn't have a cartop sign (we didn't have enough for every driver.)\n\nShe actually followed me and watched me go inside. \n\nHell even before I had a car, I used to work night stock at a grocery store and got stopped by the same cop almost every night walking to work and questioned about where I'm going. Right next to a grocery store, wearing a shirt with that grocery store's name on it... \"Same place I'm going every night, Pinky.\"",

I walked up to the crosswalk, and one of them gave me a dirty look, which I interpreted as \"stay out of our way.\" The crossing light was red, but it was a small one way street and there was no traffic, so I looked both ways and crossed.\n\nBehind me I heard, \"Hey, get back here!\" I turned and he was talking to me. \"I can't believe you just did that in front of us!\" I said, \"I was trying to stay out of your way.\" They wrote me a ticket.\n\nI fought it in court, but because I admitted I had crossed, the judge said the circumstances didn't matter, and the ticket was upheld. It was over $300. For jaywalking. Turns out it was actually much smaller, but LA has an \"assessment fee\" for pretty much all tickets that tripled (or more, I can't recall exactly) the cost.",

I really don't understand the blanket rejection of cops only parking in a designated parking spot. If there's a car accident on my street, it's going to block traffic anyway. \n\nI'd rather have cops park in the red (which doesn't even affect other drivers) when they eat so if there's a call they don't have to walk to the parking structure to get to their car. \n\nThe roads are part of the commons, which means that yes, sometimes there are delays and detours. This is not some kind of daily occurrence for people. I don't know why people feel they deserve a seamless ride from pony A to point B, regardless of your mode of transportation. Even pedestrians have deal with closed sidewalks. \n\nI'm all for defund the police and everything but when *you* need a cop, i bet you don't want it to take five minutes to get from their car to you. \n\nThis thing that happened, though ?

We need you to relocate your vehicle so we can receive the team.\"\n\nSometimes the cops were cool about it. \"Sorry, didn't realize,\" and go move it immediately.\n\nMany times, they were complete assholes. \"I'll move when I'm ready.\" or even the occasional \"Sounds like you should call parking enforcement.\"\n\nEven when there was a cop in the car while their partner was in the Starbucks, they sometimes wouldn't move. \n\nWe worked closely with the police a lot of times and most of them were pretty cool about things like this. \n\nBut there will always be the assholes who just think they're above everything.",

Miami Police Department officer Fausto Lopez led Watts for seven minutes before finally stopping. He told Watts he was on his way to an off-duty job.\n\n>>Often in such cases, the officer in charge will extend what police culture has dubbed \u201cprofessional courtesy\u201d to the offending officer. That is, they\u2019ll let him go. To her credit, Watts didn\u2019t do that. She arrested Lopez, who had a history of speeding and dangerous driving. Lopez was later fired.\n\n>>But that isn\u2019t the end of the story. The Florida Highway Patrol then investigated Watts for her handling of the incident. The agency cleared her of any wrongdoing, but it took two months. It\u2019s hard to believe a cop who arrested a regular citizen for driving 120 mph, and who then initially refused to pull over, would be subjected to a similar investigation.\n\n>>But then the real retaliation began. On police Internet discussion boards, Miami police officers posted open threats against Watts. One Miami cop apparently tried to pull over an Florida Highway Patrol officer in retaliation, until that particular move backfired. Another FHP officer found his car smeared in human feces.\n\n>>For Watts, the harassment has been quite a bit worse. She has received hundreds of calls to her private phone, some pranks, some threatening. She has had pizzas randomly delivered to her home. Strange cars began parking outside her home. And her career as a police officer may well be over. The Miami New Times reported in 2012 that her \u201csuperiors don\u2019t think she\u2019ll ever be able to return to duty on the road, and if she ever got into a situation where she needed backup she does not think she would receive it.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2014/02/18/a-plague-of-professional-courtesy/",

If it was a one way freeway, then parking on that side of the barrier might be the only way they could reach the scene without driving against traffic. And finally, since the car was flipped on the other side of the barrier, it is entirely possible that it hit the barrier on the side the fire truck was parked and went over. If this is the case, or even if it did just hit on the other side, it would have throw debris, metal shards and glass all over the highway. You don't want the public to be driving over that, so I'm pretty confident in assuming that they were parked there for good reason. Not to mention the firefighter was a 12 year veteran of the department, and responded to the scene with his captain. I would trust their judgement as to what needed to be done to control the scene and keep the public safe. This officer was way out of line.",

One big reason is people are stupid, and will want to look at what's happening. When driving a car, the car will naturally go where your eyes go. So when someone is driving 80 MPH down the freeway, and looking at the accident, and the crew working on the accident, their car will drift towards the scene, putting everyone in danger. If you park the Engine like that, it's not only a physical barrier that might help stop a car from killing you and your entire crew (a fire engine and a concrete barrier is safer than just a barrier especially when cars are traveling at freeway speeds), but it blocks their view of the accident as well, so they won't stare at the scene, and their car won't drift twords you in the first place. Not only that, but in my experience, fire engines are bigger than most shoulder anyways, so your going to be blocking a lane of traffic no matter what, you might as well angle it to where you're in the safest position possible.",

The Police (or Highway patrol) should be responsible for the whole accident, including securing the area to maintain everyone's safety (first responders, victims, other people on the road), the direction of traffic around it and organizing the cleanup afterwards.\n\nThis is a prime example of a conflict of responsibilities.

And they often get DOT trucks, which is ridiculous, they could have called a tow truck and had whatever mess was there cleaned up by the time they get a formation of DOT trucks ready. Meanwhile, in parts of NY, they do it right, and use the cruisers to shove cars that are blocking lanes off of the road to keep lanes open. If you're crashed and blocking a lane, tough shit, they're going to shove your car out of the way. Maybe people are in shock, but in honestly surprised there aren't more fights or brawls after someone crashes into someone, usually they're all just sitting there on the guardrail or standing around going \"oh shit\".",

We're not fighting the same fight. We don't need to hold some threat over the public's head that through our gallantry alone is fire held at bay the way cops do vis a vis crime. Co-opting someone else's public relations disaster is never a good move. \n\nTaking it a step further: our origin stories couldn't be more different. Police departments have their origins in protecting the haves from the have nots (yes, I'm massively simplifying here). Firefighters were citizens looking out for each other, with a little extortion (Roman soldiers turned firefighters, if you had the cash), ethnic strife (early volunteer companies were often organized along ethnic or \"nativist\" lines), and thuggery (companies would fight each other to claim bounties paid by insurance companies for getting first water on a fire; my department was founded in 1858 after the Mayor abolished volunteer companies for fighting each other rather than the fire)) thrown in: throughout our history we've been different from cops in so many ways.",

The hilarious thing to me was that he could've actually charged me with a couple of pretty serious offenses, because I was drunk in public, and taking a piss outside of a bar in an alley. Instead, he had to flex his cop status, and tell me that he was going to arrest me for doing nothing at all but apparently pissing them off. I say them, because apparently in Atlanta it takes three cop cars, and six officers to harass a 21 year old for taking a piss. They eventually let me go.",

Prosecutors were going to try to tack on, resisting arrest, assaulting an officer, public intoxication, and indecent exposure if I wanted to fight the blocking a roadway with my vehicle charge.\nI was in the middle of a divorce so I didn't need any of that bullshit. \n\nI would've won that case to. No proof of public intoxication because I was sober and there were no sobriety tests. I didn't resist arrest and all of that was on film. They refused to tell me the actual arresting officer a name and their badges were taped over. Indecent exposure was bull shit. They took of my toms and left them in the street. And possession they just tried to pin on everyone because one guy had a gram of weed in his pocket. (They missed my (prescribed) Percocet that was on my pocket during my search. But not in it's bottle so that could have been bad. It just made the drunk tank tolerable. \n\nBut fuck it, I'll take a traffic violation and no repercussions other than I have a traffic violation on my record.",

It came about during an age discrimination lawsuit when a police department refused a 50 year old candidate because he was 50 years old and then got sued for it. They decided to claim that he was rejected because he was too smart as a defense in the discrimination lawsuit.\n\nEven if what they said was true and not just some half baked defense the lawyers came up with (I tend to believe it really was age discrimination) I have seen no evidence that any other departments have similar maximum IQ gates. The reality of modern policing is that there are an increasing number of technical positions that require real education. While you can still find cops with GEDs in rural counties, in many larger cities and state police forces you are expected to be either a military veteran or to have a college education. Excluding high school graduates from joining your police force is not consistent with the claim that police don't want smart people on the force.",

Last night, a video started circulating of a local cop in my city walking up onto someone's porch and kicking their dog several times. He kicked it against the house, braced his hand against the house to put more power into the kicks, and turned his light off so that it would be hard for anyone else to see. His partner, of course, did and said nothing. One of those good ones we keep hearing about, I guess. The owner had a Ring doorbell and that is how they found out. \n\nThe cop is the president of the police union here, so obviously, nothing is going to happen. The department has already investigated and said they found nothing wrong and that it was self-defense despite him approaching the dog that was only barking and wasn't moving towards him. He was the aggressor, but okay.. The prosecution said nothing illegal happened. It's such a disgusting video.\n\nPeople are pissed, but then the sympathizers come out and come up with these what-if scenarios that don't apply to the situation. A lot of it is misinformation spread from the department's investigation, of course. It's maddening, but obviously, nothing will be done about it.",

On one hand you're absolutely right, they LITERALLY ruled out individuals with too high a score. Coming from EMS I do joke that if you do too well on an interview you might intimidate the people there, and I've definitely felt that vibe before with no proof to support it when testing.\n\nInterestingly, the court ruled that \"Even if unwise, the upper cut was a rational policy instituted to reduce job turnover and thereby lessen the economic cost involved in hiring and training police officers who do not remain long enough to justify the expense.\"\n\nEssentially, the agency had a right to issue an upper cut off because it *incorrectly* believed that high test scores were related to high turnover, which in fairness, as most agencies train their own cops from the ground up which is an enormous expense, is a pretty big deal.\n\nPersonally I think it speaks volumes to how fucking shitty recruitment in the USA is, and how generally dumb the people working there were, more so than an outright \"hey guys we only want to hire dumb people right hahaha\" type of deal but it certainly doesn't change the fact they were selecting for dumber people. Ironically, increasing funding, pay, and benefits would probably reduce turnover more than test score upper limits ever could and for that reason I'll never support defunding the police, at least not in the current state we're in.",

I don\u2019t think being too powerful is a good reason, because then a lot of unions would need to go down too. Unions need to be powerful too, since they need to attract the attention of politician on key issues for the workers. Unless there is evidence of corruption schemes and the like, it has its reason to exist and protect its members, the same way other unions do, as frustrating as it may be. That being said, there could be ways to reduce its power, but then I think it would just be applied to unions at large.\n\nEdit: just to add to your last point, I wouldn\u2019t really say that you need to support police unions, as they are abhorrent, but that denying police an union fragilize every other government funded employee unions. I just don\u2019t think that the solution is this to a problem that I do think we agree on (I read your other comment on regulation, training and militarization and I completely agree).",

When police unions bargain with the government, the same entity that they're a part of, it means that they're collectively bargaining against the people they're \"supposed to serve and protect\" (which they're not even required to do). \n\n\nPolice unions are a very peculiar edge case in which they were historically and still are used by owners to bust labor movements, in addition to protecting corrupt members from the law and not from exploitation. It's about as valid of a union as the DPRK is a Democratic Republic. \n\n\nPro labor, anti-police union. \"Reddit\" has always been like this, and it's not some sudden change due to hating cops lmao, not unless you just wanna imagine shit and get mad at the shit you made up.",

Most cops are good and it\u2019s a shame a few have to give the stigma that they are all bad. Imagine going to work and every single encounter you have could result in your death. Its stressful and impossible to be perfect at. And to top it off they really aren\u2019t compensated for what they do.\n\nI completely agree that police officers need more training in deescalation and need to be held accountable for gross negligence but saying their jobs shouldn\u2019t exist or they should be defunded is some radical shit. Anyone that thinks or says that is grossly incompetent. \n\nI actually do agree with the initial point of needing malpractice insurance it\u2019s just that I also think they don\u2019t get paid enough to afford that. Most doctors are making 200k + while cops are probably making 70k ish. If malpractice insurance is 15k (ball park estimate) that\u2019s a significant reduction in compensation when you really aren\u2019t making enough as is.",

They only hire people with a psychological need to abuse other people. \n\nBut, even if a normal person somehow slipped past the hiring process, they're still a person who watches one of the thousands of videos of police assaulting or murdering innocent people, puts on their uniform, and goes to work like nothing is wrong. \n\nEvery cop is a bastard.

The Supreme Court made a grievous error on qualified immunity. Thet ruled that unless the exact same scenario has been ruled not immune before, it is immune. poorly worded, and now taken literally.\n\nHunted down and shot in the back while trying to surrender in a field of wheat was ruled no immunity before?   \nSorry, you were hunted down and shot in the back while trying to surrender in a field of grass. Immunity held. Not exact enough.\n\nThe end result is it is almost impossible to void immunity for a cop. It gets more and more impossible as society and technology changes. Dead due to less than lethal beanbag to the skull? no rulings whatsoever on LtL weapons. its open season boys!",

Issue is, they did not just give them leeway, they pretty much ended up giving them complete freedom to just do what they want and use any miniscule difference as a basis for saying, well, this is different cause, uh, he wasn't laying down but sitting down when we let our dog maul him while he was surrendered and in our care (yes that happened).\n\nWhat is worse, qualified immunity is not law, its something that the courts and judges invented and uphold by refusing to charge a cop unless its already been ruled in a different case what they did was unlawful, as it could not be said to be known or understood by the officer to be unlawful if not specifically declared so by the judge. That is an awful ruling cause it means unlawful things have to happen before it can be made unlawful, inviting any police to do what they want as they know they can't be charged so long as that particular behavior have not been before a judge and ruled unlawful. But it could work at least to a degree, sooner or later we could maybe reach a level of cases where most bad policing would have established precedence, but they failed to also clarify what level of granularity it should be considered on, so the police can just bring up any tangential barely relevant detail and use that as justification as to why this particular criminal behavior by the police have never been found unlawful by a judge (Note, this is just my layman understanding of it, tough I have done my best to find any excuse for this absolutely awful ruling).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGenerally speaking, I find their judgements to be wise and well tought trough, as you say usually there is nuances that explains controversial ruling, but this one where it was not, where they did not properly consider the ramifications and consequences well enough and released a beast that have had huge negative ramifications to this day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile it may have been somewhat well intentioned, the road to hell is paved with good intention, and boy did they pave a whole fucking highway to hell.",

Which itself means that the next civil rights violation suit, if one ever appears with a miraculously similar set of facts, can't use it as precedent so it also fails, and so on forever.",

You can be getting stabbed to death right next to them, and it's legally A-OK for them to just walk away, or cheer on the stabber.\n\nWhile I haven't heard any cases of them outright cheering, just refusing to help and letting people die is relatively common and has been the target of many legal cases, all decided in favor of the police, as far as I am aware.\n\nMandatory reporting is totally unrelated in any way to the comment you're responding to, as that's a whole different deal than generic legal obligations to report crimes such as murder, or a dirty cop.\n\nHowever, police in California (the place the OP video takes place) are absolutely mandated reporters and MUST legally report any of the covered crimes promptly, or they might actually suffer some consequences for once.\n\n\nNow moving on even further, it is broadly the case that anywhere in the united states, failure to report a felony is a federal criminal offense. Some states have even stricter state laws about reporting a crime and what Aiding and Abetting is.\n\nAt the very least, there's very good grounds to think that any of \"the good ones\" that are passively ignoring crimes committed by the \"bad apples\" are in fact, committing a serious crime themselves, and could potentially be argued as accomplices.",

One factor is our local politicians are afraid and don't want their dirty deals aired to the public, something the fraternal order would absolutely do.",

If that was the end of the process, it may actually be manageable with identifying the bad ones and removing them.  In reality though, it's even worse than the saying suggests. Numerous times, good cops speak up and get kicked out.  It's so bad that the bad apples literally kick out the good apples as soon as they're identified as potentially good.  They actively select for rotten apples to fill up their barrel. That's the actual insidious way you end up with 100% bad cops.  They don't let the good ones even get to 1% of the bunch.",

It operates, in practice, as a closed-circuit ruling that essentially negates new claims (which would serve to create the necessary precedent for future claims) due to a lack of sufficiently similar rulings and/or facts (which are largely devoid because the previous claims also relied on the same precedent requirement). \n\nWhat do *you* think Qualified Immunity is?",

This applies to both federal and state constitutions, and it applies to the way these rights are interpreted by the courts. I\u2019ll use Graham v Connor and your right to be seized in a reasonable manner without excessive force. \n\nIt absolutely does not protect the officer from being held responsible for violating constitutional rights by any means. For example if an officer used a reasonable amount of force to arrest you, but you happened to have broken your nose because you tried to take a swing at them- qualified immunity protects the officer, as Graham v Connor is an established case outlining precisely what reasonable force is. \n\nOn the other hand if you do not resist and the officer uses an unreasonable amount of force to arrest you like striking you in the face and breaking your nose, then the officer can be held personally responsible because Graham v Connor is still a thing, and the force used would be deemed as unreasonable. He can also be held responsible criminally, for assault. \n\nThe way these precedents are set is by going through the court of appeals. If you are not satisfied with the outcome you go to a higher court. Miranda v Arizona is an example of this.",

I never said that Qualified Immunity was the same thing as Diplomatic Immunity in the sense that it is generally inalienable. I said that Qualified Immunity is a legal doctrine that, in practice, protects LEOs who have violated a civilian\u2019s constitutional rights by virtue of the fact that it creates a legal standard in which the plaintiff must prove that the type of violation and the accompanying facts of the case are substantially similar to a previous ruling. That is literally all that it is: a legal precedent used to protect government officials (including but not limited to LEOs) who are accused of violating someone\u2019s rights. \n\nYour example didn\u2019t disprove or even disagree with anything that I said. An officer can be held responsible in that scenario BECAUSE of the judicial precedent already set by Graham v. Connor, and even then it is not [not absolute](https://www.npr.org/2021/10/18/1047085626/supreme-court-police-qualified-immunity-cases). If the same exact case were being judiciated today, without Graham v. Connor already being on the books, there is a very strong chance that Connor would not have been found personally liable; for the very reason that I stated\u2014because it had not previously been \u201cclearly established\u201d and there would not have been a sufficiently similar case to determine precedent. \n\nI genuinely don\u2019t know if your end-game here is to act belligerently ignorant or just to be unnecessarily confrontational, but I am not going to continue debating this with you beyond this post. You\u2019re not arguing in good faith or making valid points.",

It does not protect civil servants who violated constitutional rights. \n\nIn summary- qualified immunity protects civil servants from frivolous civil suits for simply doing their job. It does not protect civil servants from repercussions due to the violation of your rights. A court must affirm that your rights have been violated. \n\nWhen it isn\u2019t clearly established, that\u2019s when your case moves to higher courts. That\u2019s how things become clearly established. That\u2019s how we gain additional protections. \n\nIt\u2019s absolutely idiotic to believe your average joe who couldn\u2019t get out of jury duty should decide what their rights are, and how they\u2019re interpreted. We would then run into issues like the cop appealing the decision all the way to the Supreme Court, then counter suing the original plaintiff for damages and legal fees in addition to setting clearly established laws that say they actually can do whatever act was in question. \n\nAlso you linked to the easiest open and shut court case in the world. In one, they subdued a resisting subject in compliance with Graham v Connor. In the other, they shot a man who\u2019s approaching with a dangerous weapon raised as if he intends to use it, which is also in compliance with Graham v Connor. In neither of those instances did the officers violate anyone\u2019s constitutional rights, which is very clearly established not only in Graham v Connor but also every single state\u2019s laws on the books regarding your right to defend yourself from unlawful uses of force.

Because every American does. Public defenders may be overworked to the bone and barely able to stand up in some cases but they absolutely exist. I can't imagine they would actually retain a public defender if they can avoid it but everyone in this country has the right to counsel. \n\nAre you under the impression that if a police officer gets sued that the department pays for their lawyer? They retain their own lawyers, sometimes through union deals or contracts, that are separate from the cities lawyers. \n\nEvery time a kid gets hurt and their parents sue a school, we pay for that. Every time a police officer decides to unload 9 into a disabled chair bound guy at Lowes, we pay for that. Every time a fire truck or a city bus is at fault for an accident on a roadway, we pay for that. Every time a person slips and falls in a courthouse and bruises their ass, we pay for that. I mean fuck, medical malpractice is a MASSIVE area where cities pay out the ass for peoples incompetence and/or stupidity (example: the VA under the Federal Torts Claims Act).\n\n\n> while on \u201cdesk duty\u201d getting paid\n\nDesk duty is still work, you understand that right? Temporary reassignment isn't exactly a crazy concept. Desk duty doesn't mean the guy just fucks off to a pub for 8-10 hrs a day and then gets a paycheck in the mail.",

There are the rare places where they seek out high quality candidates and you even get pay bonuses for things like having advanced degrees (masters and above), but those are few and far between.\n\nIn America, in my opinion at least, it's a good system to have 2 types of people patrolling together, you need them both to be reasonable people to begin with, and one should be a thinker and able to de-escalate, and you need a strongman in case things go down (at least in most rougher areas). It would be so easy to reform departments across the nation, it's unfortunate that the ultimate watchdogs themselves (3 letters, FBI etc) have envisioned police forces to be tools of our oppressors and ruin communities so they like it when major departments end up being filled with low IQ racists who are fast on the trigger.\n\nIt's not by accident that you see major departments across the nation be such villainous shitholes, it's largely by design.",

My old man told him he was a bit busy at the moment being on his way into that burning building over there and said, \"you've got three options: you put on this gear and go in there so I can move the truck, you figure out how to lower the boom and move the damn truck yourself, or you go around the fucking block.\" I'm pretty sure he chose option three. Cop later got his ass chewed out by the chief (who was friends with my parents) and apologized to my dad. Funny thing is they ended up being friends later",

CHP probably got tired of actually having to manage traffic, found a ticky-tacky law and sent out a mass email to all municipalities that they were going to start citing fire departments for said-ticky tacky law. \n\nThe fire-fighter taking point probably talked to the cop, cop asked him to move, firefighter said, not right now you can give me a citation and let me do my job, and then the CHP had to \u201cmake an example\u201d of him and was on a power-trip and then probably said he\u2019s under arrest for disorderly conduct, or obstruction or some stupid shit. \n\nEdit: it\u2019s in the video, but I\u2019m pointing out the officers \u201cjustification\u201d \n\nEither way it\u2019s a state run bureaucracy where people want to stay as lazy as possible. One cop decides that he is going to be the enforcer and really show what the power of the CHP can do, and here we are. \nFucking stupid if you ask me on all accounts",

The problem is that nobody wants to try to see the perspective of somebody that they don't agree with. Maybe he is just an asshole, maybe not, but I doubt it's as clear cut, black and white that everyone wants to make this out to be. The news report said that this was a common problem in the area and the firefighters have been warned before. Firefighters have a higher fatality rate then a lot of other jobs and the most common way that they die is not in fires, but instead are in traffic collisions, so maybe the cop was on a power trip, but his intentions could've been in the right place",

A century of frat boy psychology combined with an open hand to do what they please because the unions will protect them has resulted an institution which is arrogantly self-entitled and convinced they're somehow the saviors of society because they found a job that lets them continue their highschool bully bullshit and get paid for it. These people *delight* in fucking with others casually, both subtly and overtly. The fact you haven't experienced it first hand has allowed you to buy into the idea that police are our friends, like they tried to teach us in school. \n\nRemember that shit? \n\nYour lack of imagination doesn't mean that reality has to agree. The police being corrupt in North America is a cultural meme on the same level as catholic priests liking little boys and - you know, it's funny - but I seem to recall *exactly the same kind of thing you're saying* coming out of churchgoers mouths in the 90s about how that was impossible and doesn't *really* happen.\n\nYeah, look how that turned out.",

No, all they can do is report this robbery and maybe look at local cameras to see some guy in a mask walking away.\n\nHow long do you expect someone breaking in to stay there? They\u2019re gonna grab something valuable and get out. Maybe they\u2019ll shoot you if they feel threatened or are particularly psychotic. But, if the cop doesn\u2019t arrive within a few minutes, there\u2019s not much help they can offer even if they\u2019re the most altruistic officer on the planet.\n\nI\u2019m not even necessarily against the police, I\u2019m just genuinely disillusioned to what help they can even offer besides pulling over reckless drivers and reporting theft to your insurance.",

      "text": "Fire apparatus drivers are taught to park in a blocking position to protect all personnel and patients within the accident scene.  This spans the lane the accident resides in and partially in the next lane in order to protect those working on Patient care and the scene from being struck by a passing vehicle.  Police are there to manage traffic flow and the Incident Commander is the OIC on the Fire/EMS side, not the Police.   Proper chain of command is to approach the OIC to inquire if the blocking apparatus can be moved in order to ease the return of traffic flow and arresting an apparatus driver not only hinders caregiving but in some cases it will delay the moving of the apparatus from the scene if another qualified driver of the unit isn\u2019t on scene.\n\nA nearby municipality recently had a LODD and 2 other FF\u2019s injured by a DUI driver while working on a scene due to proper blocking not being enforced.  A delay in someone\u2019s commute is not more important than preserving the lives of the personnel working a scene.\n\n\n\n- I\u2019m aFirefighter/EMT",

Giving you a safe lane to walk, and to try and prevent someone rear ending you.\n\nLiving in Texas now, I see the same technique being used. In theory the firefighters are using a more extreme version of that to tend to possibly wounded people.

Over the life course, about 1 in every 1,000 black men can expect to be killed by police. Risk of being killed by police peaks between the ages of 20 y and 35 y for men and women and for all racial and ethnic groups. Black women and men and American Indian and Alaska Native women and men are significantly more likely than white women and men to be killed by police. Latino men are also more likely to be killed by police than are white men.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.pnas.org/content/116/34/16793",

                              "text": "\n\nListen, I'll really try to explain this to you because you seem like you're genuinely lost. A lot of people who are saying the same thing as you are trolling or intentionally using racist/fascist dog whistles to rally their team, spread propaganda, and generally gain support. That's why I come down so hard on it, and why people are downvoting you.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFirst, you need to understand there's no such thing as \"just sharing a fact\". A fact is either a fact in context, or it's just kinda nonsense. I could say \"The earth is ~91 million miles from the sun\" and that's just a fact. But in the discussion we're having it doesn't make any sense. It's the wrong context. Likewise saying \"not all cops do this\" is true, but it has extra meaning in context. It additionally implies that not all cops are culpable for this conduct. It also suggests that what American policing needs is minor tweaks. We need to get rid of some of these bad apples and then everything will be alright. That leads to the anger you're seeing.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nBy \"just stating a fact\" you're being caught up with other people who have stated that fact for a purpose. The purpose other people have put that fact to is maintaining US policing in its current state (or with some very minor tweaks). This is why you're seeing so much anger. There are people groups who suffer incessantly and systemically at the hands of the American Police (and criminal justice system more broadly). These are marginalized, often voiceless groups who are doing their best to cry out for justice and are frequently vilified for it. I don't know what your take on BLM is, but they're one of these groups and whether you like them or not I don't think you can disagree that they're vilified.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nTaking this view makes business-as-usual or minor tweaks a totally untenable\u00a0option. For true justice to be perpetrated in America the system needs an overhaul. Currently policing duties need to be reconsidered. Then they need to be distributed. The vast majority of mental health cases should be handled by social workers, not police. Traffic accidents, for the most part, could be handled by a non-police entity. There are so many things police do that don't need a man with a gun present. By breaking out these services and giving them dedicated teams we can leave the few things that do need a man with a gun to the police. All this allows for much deeper specialized training as citizen's needs are met by the government.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nBeyond that dream, there is currently a massive issue with accountability. Because of the way police and prosecutors protect each other and themselves it's almost impossible to get justice for crimes committed by police. So even if we don't go all the way to the dream in the above paragraph, it would be a huge stride to break up the police union, force police themselves to pay civil settlements, and find a way to actually charge and convict police for committing crimes. This is such a big problem I don't have a framework for the solution. But it starts with the citizenry as a whole being fed up with and totally intolerant of police. We need to end policing in its current form or millions of marginalized peoples are going to continue living (and too often dying) in fear.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nI hope that goes some way to explaining why you're getting an angry response and downvotes. I also hope it gives some context on why people say \"all cops\" and aren't satisfied with \"a few bad apples\". It just doesn't work that way.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nSince this post is already crazy long I just want to add an extra example from my own industry to hopefully make it make more sense. I work in plumbing for a medium sized company. If we have an employee who does really poor work and causes some explosive leak two things happen: 1. we compensate the customer out of our own money. 2. that employee is either going to be fired or is going into a major retraining program. At that point we can say \"yeah, there are always going to be some bad employees, but we make it right\". Imagine for a moment we didn't do that. That we don't compensate the customer, and when they win a civil suit we make the taxpayer pay for it (like cops do). We don't fire or retrain the employee, but just move him to a branch in another city. Imagine we do that over and over with all our \"bad apples\". The result would be that people recognize OUR ENTIRE COMPANY as a bad company, and we go out of business. The problem is that cops can't go out of business. Allowing the \"bad apples\" to continue makes the whole company bad, not just the bad apples.\u00a0\u00a0\n  \nIf you've read this far I really appreciate it. I hope this goes some way toward broadening your mind on things. Sorry for any spelling/grammar errors, I just pounded this out at work and didn't do too much proofreading. Let me know if you have questions or whatever.  \n  \nEdit: the line breaks derped put when I copy pasted, sorry about that.",

Firefighters had placed their vehicle along the center road divider, close to where a car had flipped over, and behind an ambulance. Emergency personnel tended to the car's two occupants as the conflict went on around them.\n> \n> The firefighter, Jacob Gregoire, 36, was held in the police car for about 30 minutes before being released, CBS 8 says. The station posted video showing Gregoire talking to the news crew to be sure they knew what was taking place.\n> \n> \"Hey, I just want to let you know, he's arresting me for not moving the fire truck,\" Gregoire can be heard yelling.\n> \n> And with that, he was handcuffed. Despite the unusual situation and the disagreement it followed, the firefighter and police officer aren't seen exhibiting much aggression toward one another in the video, which shows them talking as Gregoire is led away.\n> \n> The fire department's chief tells CBS 8 that while the CHP would have jurisdiction over a scene on the interstate, it wasn't yet clear whether the police had claimed control when the dispute escalated. The fire truck was reportedly the first to arrive at the scene.\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/02/05/272144424/police-officer-arrests-firefighter-at-accident-scene-in-california",

And fyi, my girlfriend is chinese/vietnamese and ive heard and seen the things that asian people have experienced in the last year. So i am very much inclined not to be racist towards asian people. \n\nUnless you are referring to the fact that i said since the first chinese person. Which i will respond with, do you know anything about history? The reason china is so big today is because they expanded really really fast for many many years in history and they have continued to attempt to expand throughout history in a similar fashion.",

              "text": "Let\u2019s get some context here. The Dutch police didn\u2019t just open fire for no reason here - they opened fire on 3 rioters in Rotterdam who were attacking police. Rioters who were starting fires, setting off fireworks at police, and using makeshift weapons. 3 rioters shot. The Dutch police shoot and kill, on average, 4 people a year. The US kills, on average about 1100. Once you take into account population that\u2019s 2.3 per 10 million compared to 33.5 per 10 million.\n\nAustralia isn\u2019t a police state. You should try reading articles from outside of your right wing bubble buddy. Australia has increased covid restrictions, sure, but that doesn\u2019t make it a police state. I\u2019m also not sure what these \u201cmandatory check ins\u201d you speak of are. The state of Western Australia has an app called SafeWA that allows you to check in to venues when you go there to aid in contact tracing, similar to the UK\u2019s NHS contact tracing app. But this isn\u2019t mandatory.\n\nGas being 7 dollars doesn\u2019t really seem relevant to anything but ok.\n\nIn regards to energy in the EU, 25% of petroleum and 43% of natural gas comes from Russia. Sure, it\u2019s a lot, but far from the majority.\n\nDefense spending, wrong again, the US contributes less to European defense spending than Europe does. The EU spends about $300bn on defense. What exactly is the US \u201cdefending\u201d Europe from? The vast majority of US defense spending goes to defending itself and starting foreign wars. Ultimately, if you don\u2019t want to defend the EU, then leave? But you see, the presence of the US in Europe is more for the benefit of the US than Europe itself. \n\nAlso, the irony of an American lecturing basically anyone in the world about bombing people. The US has basically been at war since it\u2019s inception. In the last 80 years, you\u2019ve been involved in like 8 wars\u2026",

He still refused and then the cop arrested him and called someone from the county (city?) to come move the truck since none of the firefighters there were authorized or allowed to or something.\n\nIt's a little fuzzy, but that's what I recall originally from the news story - that being said OP is just trying to score anti-cop karma.",

I don\u2019t see a mass exodus of Muslims from their religion because of this, nor do I see a large Muslim movement condemning or wanting to eradicate the practice from their religion; they are all complicit then, no?",

No one has ever written a song called \u201cfuck the fire department\u201d no one has ever graffitied AFAB. \n\nPolice and firefighters have very different jobs and because of that respond to their respective situations differently. If you have to call the cops (for a legit reason) you\u2019re already the victim or about to be a victim and your day sucks. Then people show up asking a bunch of questions that make you relive the experience and force you to question how you responded and acted to said experience. When you call the fired department for a legit reason they come and actively try to remedy the situation in real time for the best possible outcome.\n\nHouse on fire? Here comes a group to help stop it and save as much of your valuables as possible. In a car accident? Here\u2019s comes a group to give you first aid and make sure there\u2019s no danger for future motorists (fuel spills, debris etc) never mind if you\u2019re trapped in a vehicle. And then if you\u2019re stuck in a shitty spot or trapped they have to work as engineers in real time to save a life. \n\nI didn\u2019t write all this to shit on cops. I wrote it to show why naturally we all went \u201cwhat a fucking asshole\u201d when the cop went to put the cuffs on the firefighter. That firefighter could have been on video pissing in that cops fuel tank 3 seconds and none of us would care cause\u2026.don\u2019t fuck with firefighters.

Also, by saying that you're insinuating that if it was more than that it would be ok for him to be arrested.\n\nSomewhat related: When you get into an accident you need to move to the shoulder. It's ok if you want to get out and take a quick video because you think it's going to be that important, but you can't just leave your car sitting in the road because look out I got into an accident this is serious evidence.\n\nAnd while I'm at it, I don't understand those people who pull over for police immediately, regardless of where they are. No cop is going to say why did you wait 500 ft to pull into this parking lot instead of just stopping on that shoulder-less road? Like do people think the cop is going to rip them out of the car and arrest them for evading because they didn't put the officer in danger and back traffic up? It happens way too much, I see people pulled \"over\" all the time when there's a parking lot or side street right in front of them.",

If it's too backed up, get off the freeway and try another route. \n\nBut when it comes down to it, you protect the scene from traffic so that the folks providing aid don't have to worry about it. \n\nThat CHP officer should be named and shamed. He could have decided not to enforce the rule. Or handled it in a dozen other ways other than arresting one of the responders.\n\nAlso, remember that joke that's made the rounds lately: no one ever made a song called \"Fuck the Fire Department\".",

I don't agree with the arrest, but I also don't believe the cop was in the wrong here. This is taken from the subsequent court case that was filed:\n\n\n> At this accident scene, as he heard the conversation between Colunga and the firefighters, Flores assessed that the **ambulance** which had responded to treat the patients was parked **in the center median area and out of traffic lanes** and the **collision did not occur in any southbound lanes**, so there was **no debris field in any southbound lanes**. (Id. \u00b6 9.) Flores believed that having **fire trucks parked in traffic lanes were posing a serious risk and unnecessary risk** to the public and the trucks were **not needed to protect the accident scene since it was fully shielded in a large center construction area by cement k-rail walls.** (Id.) The truck he was trying to get moved was on the I-805, which is a freeway on which people commonly travel at high speeds and **he was concerned about** vehicles approaching at high speeds and unexpectedly coming upon stopped emergency vehicles without time to react and **causing secondary accidents** and additional people getting injured or killed.  (Id.) \n\nIt is good to note here that this is the officer's statement. There is a counter statement by the fire department that says the Ambulance was being shielded by the truck for loading/unloading. So I'll take this with a grain of salt. The summary judgement was denied and the case was settled.\n\nSource: https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/california/casdce/3:2014cv01749/448978/46/",

I'm not an expert on the law but I don't think that the assault law was passed with this kind of incident in mind.\nBritish police officers would be glad that someone is taking care of someone ,who, if left to fend for themselves would give bigger problems ( ambulance or police department time that is better used for emergencies).\nIMHO training and flexibility to look at the bigger picture is very important and helpful working practice.\nI don't know how long the training period is in the US but for UK police officers it's 2 years,then a probation period under the wing of an experienced officer ( don't forget that the British police officers don't carry firearms,so it's two years of learning the law and the working procedures)",

I was first on scene with 4 other people in the heavy rescue truck and we blocked the highway with the truck. About 2 minutes later, while I was getting a collar out of the truck, a cop came up to me and told me \u201cyou have to move this now. Traffic will be backed up for hours\u201d. I informed him that moving the truck will put this ours and the victims life in jeopardy because cars will be zooming past us. He didn\u2019t care and I told my driver what was going on and he moved the truck. What should have been 10-15 minutes took us 45 minutes because we had to take extra precautions. The victim was fine and was even able to stand up on his own but still went to the hospital (added this in just for readers peace of mind).\n\nAnyways, when cleaning up the scene, a 16 wheeler drive down the highway causing my PW extinguisher (pressurized water extinguisher) to tip over and roll down the highway. It rolled and rolled until eventually it picked up some speed and hit the cops in the ankles causing him to fall onto the truck of his cop car. He got up and screamed \u201cwho did that! I\u2019ll arrest you for obstructing a crime scene!\u201d. We all ignored him and waited for the tow truck company to get to the scene to take the car.\n\nWhen the tow truck came, the guy told us \u201cuhhh\u2026 I need way more room in order to pack this thing up\u201d. The driver gladly blocked off the highway again and let the two truck drive through. During the 10 minutes it took, that cop was talking faster than an auctioneer. He called for back up and not even a minute later his chief called him and told him to stop. The cop was fuming and took off the moment the car was put on the tow truck.\n\nSomebody from my station is neighbors with the guy and told his kid to ride his bike in front of his driveway whenever he goes to leave his house (in his civilian car only). The stories I hear come out of this are some of the best stories I have ever heard.",

It appears that it was done to flex his authority and because he knows that he could get away with it.\n\nIt seems that the US needs to reevaluate its police training and use of deadly force doctrine. It could be beneficial for the US to look at how Europeans do their policing. Countries such as Ireland requires four years of college to be a Garda (Policeman), and the members of their armed support unit are personally responsible whenever there is a need to discharge their weapon. The Gardai has to investigate whether the use of deadly force was necessary for that situation, and the officer in question could be held accountable for their action if the evidence indicates. However, the state offers immunity to the police officer only if it is proven that deadly force was justifiable. With a bit of tweak, the US could improve on and adopt such a system for the safety of the civilian population, especially the members of marginalised communities/groups. \n\nEdit: Clarity",

Why did he walk the fireman out into the dark away from any emergency vehichles (shouldn't his cruiser be lit up if its parked on the side of the road...where is it)? The car looks to be flipped in the median between two concrete barricades so why did a fire truck need to block traffic? Why was a ladder truck responding to a flipped car? Why is the fire truck only shown in a seperate shot, looks to be on a different crash scene and with suddenly much lower camera quality? Why does the patient look perfectly fine? How is the radio chatter so crystal clear for this? Am I the only one seeing this shit? Bravo to OP if this is staged because they turned the the responses into facepalm gold.",

How is cuffing the fireman and throwing him in a cop car going to rectify the situation? It won't magically move the truck. He didn't walk the guy to to truck and have him move it first, which would have been the smart move if he was genuinely concerned about public safety. Instead he's just taken a first responder away from an accident with actual injuries for the sake of imaginary people who MIGHT get injured later, that he doesn't actually seem to be worried about.

Why is he only butthurt about one fireman in the bunch? Couldn't they all have moved it, thus they all defied him? If there's allegedly two urgent situations (the current accident with injuries, and the dangerous truck that might cause more injuries) going on, why is he wasting time doing this? Now if someone goes to move the truck, 2 first responders are away from the scene. Shouldn't he be coming up with another way to protect the public now, then come handle the fireman once things are cleared?\n\nIf the emergency vehicle is in a weird spot/position in the roadway, whatever the size, the cop usually parks their car up ahead with the lights on. In my area that's what they're trained to do. Its never posed a problem and it's pretty easy for drivers to figure out what's happening. I dont see how it's more reasonable to handle the situation like this cop did if he truly believed the public was in danger. Signs point to emotional response, not rationally trying to help.",

So you're telling me to use my brain when you are basing your whole opinion on this snippet rather than even attempting to see a bigger picture. I'm not defending anyone, but I highly doubt some rando cop would risk his entire career to arrest an actively working firefighter just because of ego. I'm just pointing out the fact that we have this and only this to go off of. There a million videos out there that have no context and automatically make cops out to be the bad guy. The story could be much more complicated. Maybe stop following the loud crowd and follow your own advice. Just because he is EMS doesnt mean he can break the law. Just because the  cop has a badge doesnt mean he can just be a dick. \nThis was great, have a good one \ud83e\udd19",
