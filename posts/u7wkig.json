We don't have this view about other unprovable negatives with no evidence to support their existence. There's just a default disbelief until something justifies belief - especially if there's evidence for alternative explanations for whatever that belief is intended to explain. To use a typical example, adults rarely consider themselves Santa agnostic just because it's impossible to prove he doesn't exist in some way, shape, or form.\n\n>I don\u2019t believe in gods and I don\u2019t believe anyone can prove god exists or doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nIf nothing else, gods themselves could prove they exist, at least as far as I understand their supposed attributes. Whether humans could prove it would surely depend on the god(s) in question, no?\n\nThe same goes for non-existence as I see it: some belief systems are incompatible with logic as we understand it, and thus already disproven according to the standards we'd use for any non-religious subject matter. Others cannot be disproven since it's impossible to prove a negative.",

Which is fine, it's pretty niche if we're honest\n\n\n* https://www.guidestar.org/profile/82-3404757 claims it doesn't need to report to the IRS because they're a church. Which makes sense, that's part of the point. So I don't think they're a 503 as you said since 2019 or so. (I think the Wikipedia page confirms they're not a 503 anymore)\n\n\nI just genuinely don't know what the mechanisms for accountability are for their leadership or the organization as a whole. It might still be great, and like I said at the start I'm open to it being great, I'd just like to see evidence of a good process and not just individual actions that seem to be things I agree with.",

But the Satanic Temple, explains its not devoted to worshipping Satan, but rather teaching rational and scientific ways of thinking.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of evil already in this world, so to allow it to come into our school and our community is not OK.\u201d said parent, Laura Vangeli.\n\n\u201cSatan is a liar and Satan will show himself as light when in fact he\u2019s not light.\u201d Maddie Snelbaker said.\n\nHundreds of parents bringing out the pitchforks to tonight\u2019s school board meeting.\n\nAccording to the Satanic Temple \u2013 a couple parents from the district asked for the program \u2013 in response to the board green lighting a bible study group during school hours.\n\n\u201cThe school board does not have the authority to decide which religious organizations they prefer holding after school clubs and which one they don\u2019t.\" Said Lucien Greaves, the Cofounder of Satanic Temple. Greaves stresses the club doesn\u2019t support worshipping Satan or any religion.\n\n\u201cI hope that when people understand that it will be less easy for them to use these old witch hunter mythologies that never served a positive function.\u201d Greaves said.",

Not that it matters, because they could easily hold the ASSC off campus just like the other one, but the school is banning the concept altogether, which is illegal. The club would need to be approved and have bussing options made available just like the Joy El Christian Club gets.\n\nEdit: not to mention, the 2001 Supreme Court Case ruling \"Good News Club v. Milford Central School\" stated that it was a violation of the first amendment to deny a religious club access to a school district's limited public forum, so they can't ban the club. At all. They have to allow it to use the school.",

I doubt very seriously anyone would raise an eyebrow over me doing so for 36 hours' worth of time in a school year.

So you're born with / already have the philosophy, but upon reading The Satanic Bible, you are finally able to put a name to how you feel.\n\nAgain, church of satan doesn't do any of the stuff you mentioned, while the satanic temple does, but isn't reflective of actual satanism",

You could call it the Temple for Secular Rationalists and it would achieve the exact same thing. \n\nIt's all very illogical and misguided.  TST goes out of its way to say that they don't worship Satan, and that the core belief of their \"religion\" is secular rationalism. So if it's goal is to be a poison pill to reinforce separation of church and state, then they're arguing for separation of the state from secular rationalism?  Secular rationalism is what is supposed to be in the schools when we ***do*** have a robust separation between church and state.  \n\nIt's a sophomoric game within the current legal order, rather than taking on the real principles at stake. That's an excellent way to win a meaningless battle while losing the war.  The legal order that this strategy depends on is slipping away, and intentionally conflating secular rationalism with Satan worship is not going to help with that. The goal has to be to change minds.",

It's true when people haven't heard of you at all, but everybody knows that atheists exist. The challenge isn't to make theists aware of atheists; it is to make theists see atheists as decent regular people who happen to have a different view on the origin of the universe. I strongly suspect that for every person who reads a full article about TST, thinks about it and comes away with some better-educated view, there are many multiples who read the headline and thank god that Karen McWingnut is on the school board to protect the kids from the Satanists. (As a rationalist, I of course can be persuaded to change my mind with data, but I haven't found any, so I have to go with my experience and common sense.)  \n\nWould Will & Grace have done so much to normalize homosexuality if it had been called The Pedophile and the Spinster (with a banner at the beginning of every show saying \"We don't really endorse pedophilia\")?",

If one makes a mistake, one should do one's best to rectify it and resolve any harm that might have been caused.\n\nVII\nEvery tenet is a guiding principle designed to inspire nobility in action and thought.
