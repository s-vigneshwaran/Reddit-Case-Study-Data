  "text": "TIFU I thought a cute guy was ghosting me....only to find out I was actually ghosting him.\nI was at a party two weeks ago, where I only knew two people. when in walks this guy who immediately gave me this really big smile and I thought he was so gorgeous. We ended up talking in the same circle and he introduces himself. We start chatting and quickly find the circle around us has disappeared and it is just us. \n\nHe is so smart, his smile is outrageously cute, and I love how he seems laser focused on me instead of one of the many attractive women that have now joined the party and are talking about their cool Raya dates. \n\nAs the night wore on, I found myself talking to various different groups, but, each time this guy would appear again and we'd end up just talking to each other again. Someone who neither of us knew came up and said we made an attractive couple, and I realized somehow in the span of two hours we were already acting like a couple. It wasn't just being sexually attracted to him, I felt so comfortable around him and he was so attentive to my needs. \n\nI told him offhand I had allergies to the dog at the party. Hours later when I started sneezing he immediately knew why and moved us outside. His smile was the thing that immediately caught my attention but it was the thoughtfulness that made it so at the end of the night, we catch an Uber home together and end up kissing. Before the Uber drops him off I give him my number. \n\nSunday comes, don't hear from him. Ok, ok, I get it, we both got home at 4am and I too just want to sleep the day away. \n\nMonday comes. Silence. \n\nTuesday, even more silence. I know I've read how it is \"uncool\" to text a girl immediately because you want to seem super cool and wanted, but we're both in our mid-thirties and, I hoped, realized these mind games are bullshit. If you like someone, text them when you can. Life is too short to be with people half-interested in you. \n\nWednesday comes and I'm a mixture of angry and over it and insecure all at the same time. How dare he lead me on like this! ...Well, I guess I'm glad I only wasted one night on this asshole....was I not pretty enough? All these thoughts raced through my head and coalesced into me typing his name and work place into Google to see if I can find him. \n\nTurns out, he was incredibly easy to find. I was planning on just looking at him because I missed his face, but I accidentally clicked the link that brought me to his LinkedIn page. Yikes! Now he'll know that I stalked him which made me feel even worse. >.< I probably looked crazy. \n\nWelp, since I was already on his page I guess I'd look at where he had worked. Maybe he wasn't really interesting and I'd feel better about him ghosting me. \n\nNope, turns out he is not only very smart but also humble because his resume listed a dozen different cool jobs, impressive schools he's attended, things he's worked on. Great, I probably wasn't impressive enough for him. -_- \n\nNot thirty minutes later he friends me on LinkedIn, but seems surprised that I was reaching out. He had evidently texted me that night, and again the next day, only to not hear anything back. I had ghosted him. \n\nAnd this is how we found out my fuck up. When I gave him my number, turns out I was off by a digit. Turns out, tipsy me isn't so great at typing or proofreading. \n\nIf I hadn't been a creepy LinkedIn stalker, it could have been months, if ever, before we would have seen each other again. Right now we're laughing about it and setting up our first real date. Wish me luck Reddit!\n\nTL;DR Thought a cute guy was ghosting me. Turns out, I gave him the wrong number. Fixed my fuck up by using my cyber stalking skills, and now we're going on a date!",

You have the clearly absurd ones totally unaware of what they're saying (e.g. life is easy just get a 10m loan from your parents), the attention seekers (e.g. \"work is hard\" and a random picture of them in a bikini on a beach), the corporate shills (e.g. the #hustle culture crap), and the influencers (e.g. \"Thoughts?\", \"Agree?\" At the end of the post trying to get engagement for the algorithm to spread their crap).\n\nPersonally, I think most of them are toxic. LinkedIn started as a professional networking site and you have people acting very unprofessionally, and/or advocate for unhealthy work/life balance, or just outright posting opinions that don't belong in your workplace (e.g. politics). And to make it worse it's all under the thin veneer of \"business speak\". \n\nLike, I don't know, if you don't see the appeal maybe you're not the target audience. Or maybe you can post about the #Hustle and #Struggle on LinkedIn after you find #Success. Thoughts?",

We were pretty drunk and at the club, I felt like dancing so I looked around and picked a girl to dance with me. Being very drunk I started to dance really silly, like making awkward moves not taking myself seriously, she liked it and joined me! We didn't even chat or anything. After the song ended I thanked her and went back to my friends to chat.\n\nA couple moments later I feel taps on my shoulder and when I turn around it's her! She asks me if I have her phone and my autistic self thought she lost it, or maybe thinks I stole it during the dancing, so I start looking for it around the club... I saw her facepalm and push her phone in my hands to enter a number. So I did, but my drunken self put completely wrong number.\n\nHow do I know that? I met her again! In completely different club couple months later with different group of friends. We chatted and exchanged real numbers this time.\n\nUnfortunately nothing more came out of that, but still a funny memory to have.",

Well as fate would have it I was moving and was selling a futon.  \n\nThe buyer was him.  He came and picked up and when I opened the door the look on my face was a mix of shock, horror and disgust.  But still he paid for the futon I at least needed to let him get it.  He was a completely different guy and he noticed we were reading the same book. Then he noticed we had similar tastes in movies and music.  He asked me out on a proper date later in the week.  I refused saying I was moving.  Well he came and helped me move, then bought pizza that night. After that I couldn\u2019t say no to his offer of a proper date. \n\nI learned the night I met him he was at his buddy\u2019s bachelor party and he never drinks so just a few drinks hit him hard.  He felt so embarrassed when he saw me at my house getting the futon.  He knew he made an ass of himself and thought the likelihood of running into me again was slim to none so he just was going to write it off as a learning lesson.

Lots in common, lots of things to talk about, seemed witty/funny/cute/endearing so i gave her my email address, said let's connect off the site and get together!\n\nAbout a week goes by and I'm like... fuck I guess she found someone more interesting than me. Which was par for the course, i had gotten out of a long relationship and wasn't used to the new landscape of internet dating where everyone ghosts everyone as soon as someone with more promise/potential shows up. I hadn't even planned on messaging her because when I had logged on to lavalife and saw her message, i was actually there with the intent to delete my account and stop dating for a while, but i liked the stuff in her profile so much that i thought i'd let her be the last person i connect with and *then* I'll delete my account. It was more of the same ghosting crap, so I felt pretty bummed. \n\nThrowing caution to the wind though, because she did seem really nice, I reached out to say \"hey *just in case* here's my email address again, I haven't heard from you so if you DID email me maybe just copy/paste because there's this typo that you might make\" and sure enough, ***she had typed my email address wrong***.\n\nAnd thank god I reached out because she thought i was ignoring her and not getting back to her! How did it go? well we'll be married 5 years this year and we've got kids, a house, etc etc. So it has a very, very happy ending!",

I was in an odd spot by this point, getting out of a 4 year long relationship (just after graduating high school) and wanted to remain single a while to center myself. I was always dating someone so i never really took time to address my own needs. \n\nBut this girl made that inner strength dry right up and i find myself speculating on just how far out of my league she might be. I finally get the confidence to talk to her a bit (because drinks and assorted unhealthy habits that you practice in college) and immediately kind of freeze up. \n\nI asked for her name, she tells me. And all my dumb little man brain thinks is to say \"your name is ____?\" Point to my brother, of the same name. \"His name is _____.\" Some friends then call me over to play pool and i just walk away, slightly panicked and just as stupid. \n\nNot only did i never tell her my name, never gave her my number, and none of my friends knew who she was because she hadnt hung out with our group before. So i did what any reasonable person does after possibly missing thier chance at thier dream partner: start looking on facebook. \n\nSo i start browsing friends of friends of people who dont even use facebook hoping to find her. The college page, in case she followed it there for some reason. Everywhere i could think. No dice. Until a few days later. She had the same idea and much more luck than i did, as it recommended me as a friend to her. Probably because of all the traffic i generated from trying to find her. \n\n3 botched, disasterous \"first dates\" behind us, and we have been together almost 7 years.",

              "text": "Too long for the origional, which was wordy enough lol. \n\nFirst disaster was going to our downtown area to a park. We have a relatively small, safe city comoared to larger ones. And our parks here are fairly spacious, with a bike/jogging path connecting a few of the smaller ones to the park kind of in the center. I decided to take her to one that was fairly remote, has a nice little waterfall, and a big rock overlooking a small pond. I enjoy standing on top of large rocks, and thought she would enjoy it too. \n\nWhat i did not realize is that not everyone, especially a gorgeous gal who prepped for a nice date in dainty shoes (not heels, but a nice, white cloth, lace shoe, like Toms), can just climb up hills and rocks like i do. And not after rain with shockingly deep mud puddles. So those shoes inevitably got ruined, stained forever when she stepped in said puddle. And ripped more of it shortly after. \n\nThus it was deemed not a great first date, and allowed me to try again. \n\nFirst date #2, i just got a sudden stomach bug and she offered to come take care of me instead. \n\nFirst date #3 was a two-fer. We started with ice cream, which was a mistake because she is lactose intolerant. And half way through not enjoying her ice cream while i enjoyed mine, i got a call from my mother. To remind me (it was new info for me, not a reminder) that it was our mothers day and what time i needed to be at her house. Which was very soon. And i had no gift. So we shopped for a gift in 25 mins and i left. \n\nAnd those are the infamous 3 first dates of disaster.",

Even randomly ran into a bunch of my other friends while there, and we end up hanging out with a bunch of them. \n\nWe get asked at one point by one of the couples there how long we'd been together. We laughed together when we said \"it's actually our first date!\"\n\nThat basically sealed it for me though, knew she could be it based on that question, and that I was an idiot for hemming and hawing until that point. \ud83e\udd26",

That's also pretty normal to feel like that. Maybe they know it's stupid saying it like this, maybe it's tongue in cheek, maybe it's just hyperbole, maybe a joke we don't get. \n\nI just wanted to give my thoughts, we should try to take the positive out of meeting nice people, not mourn the missed hypothetical relationships. At least that's what I think, and try to do out there in the dating world. Lots of weird people out there, but also lots of awesome people we can engage with and learn from and grow through without necessarily mutually falling for one another. And if we lucky, some day someone we like also likes us and doesn't mind our flaws and quirks, we all want that, just like OP.",

She eventually called me out and said something along the lines of, \"are you ever going to reach out or just keep looking my pictures?\". Turns out the number same gave me was one digit off. We've been dating for 6 years, have a daughter together, and are finally engaged. \n\nTLDR: Congrats on the future engagement OP!",

She added me on facebook and my phone was dead, so I said I would do it in the morning.\n\nThe morning comes and she's getting in her car to go leave. She asks me if I accepted her friend request and I go \"no, I forgot\" and she took that as a \"no I won't\". I had to clarify that my adhd arse forgets things and that I would have seen it eventually and accepted straight away.\nThree weeks go by and she messages me, because my adhd arse forgot to hit the send button before I did some laundry or something, I thought she was ghosting me lmao.\nWe laughed about it on our first date, and we went from constantly getting acquainted to becoming best friends. I can tell her anything, and she has made me a better person.\n\nI hope everything works out for you OP",

Seen this one girl who I thought was cute, hence why I added her. She had a mutual connection as that was a coworker at work who got me in there in the first place. My friend texts me a day or so later and says something in the context of \u201cI was weird for adding her,\u201d coming from her to him. \n\nA few months go by, and Im leaving work. I see my buddy coming with that girl beside him as she\u2019s in a rush to catch the train. He briefly introduces me to her. \n\nA few weeks go by, and there\u2019s a work lunch party. At the time I had finally started going to a barber to get my haircut professionally. Well at the party I notice her looking at me. Didn\u2019t think much of it, but knew something was up. About a week or two after that party, she messages me on Skype out of the blue. We end up getting to know one another. \n\nNothing much came out of that until last year when we started hanging outside of work. By then I had moved on from the company. We met a couple times whether it was her and I or mutual friends who would join us. Things ended up changing around July 4th as she ended up meeting her current boyfriend at a party while I was away at a wedding I was in. \n\nI was bummed once I officially knew something was up weeks later after she met my friend and I late one night in the city. We still talk these days as just friends, but not as often as we once did. Sadly I\u2019ll never really know how she felt about me as she was one of a select number of girls I\u2019ve met in life who have had an interest in the stuff I do. Woe is me:/",

Like every single detail was the exact same until the very end when you guys ended up together again. Thre myself a pity party for like 5 days till I eventually just tried to get over her. I rarely ever have an actual crush on someone and like 95% of the time I put the charm on we usually end up together. We had such a lovely time that ended in a small kiss and going our seperate ways. I guess at 2am she sent me a booty call but I was tired and wanted to have a nice date the next day. Next day every message I sent just went to \"unread\" and never heard from her again. Oh well",

      "text": "I have had instances like this but when it came to online. There are so many ways to easily accidentally give someone the wrong e-mail address, or username, or forget to add someone to your friends list or something like that. \n\nThen there is the fact I have come across people who have forgotten a password to their account and don't remember/have access to the e-mail associated with said account anymore and thus can't get back on it. Luckily for us we had more than 1 way of communicating so was able to find out and get their new account etc but some aren't so lucky. Though kinda stupid to set up an account on some IM service and not have the e-mail wrote down or something somewhere and just forget what it is. :S\n\nI have also experienced (though not anymore lol) someone disappearing for a long time only to have them come back and find out they were grounded from the internet by parents. I had one a long time ago who had over protective parents and if their brother got into trouble they both got grounded from the internet and thus would lost contact with them for sometimes months at a time. Luckily I didn't delete them off of the IM we used back then and eventually they came on one day and apologized for being gone so long. It then happened frequently enough that I knew just to wait to hear from them again. \n\nAlso my last ex a long time ago disappeared for like a month and found out it was cause of her internet being turned off. Though kinda annoying she didn't just go to a local library, or use a computer at a friends house to just send me a quick e-mail or something to let me know what was going on. \n\nThough that also caused problems in the future when adding someone to an IM and then they delete/block me after a while and some (even to this day) don't show/tell you that you have been deleted/blocked by them so you will wait around for months wondering what happened to said person. Thus why I always try to message someone before deleting them and just give them a short message that im deleting them so they don't sit there waiting for months wondering why I don't come back online for them. \n\nBeen deleted/blocked by so many just out of the blue with no rhyme or reasoning and without any warning which is quite annoying when you expect to chat with them more later only for later to never happen. So yeah ghosting stinks and even worse if it's done by accident cause then each other person could think the other one is a jerk and then you lose out on a possible friendship or more. \n\nI worry about that, thus when I meet someone who I hit it off with I try to add them to more than one thing, or find more than just one way to contact them just in case something happens like a glitch, or accidentally deleting them or your account getting hacked/shut down etc.",
