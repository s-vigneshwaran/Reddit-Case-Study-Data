The critical energy innovation fund ARPA-E was put on hold and proposed to be cut in the first Trump budget. \n\nComing from the private sector its impossible to overstate how unacceptable that level of ineptitude would be.

Their motto is \u201cBenedictus fructus ventris tui.\u201d and they\u2019ve recruited from every religious group that fights against abortion and/or contraception rights.\n\nMany people get involved without ever knowing the organization\u2019s name or even of its existence, believing they\u2019ve found an organic, grassroots, peer-to-peer movement.\n\nLay members who formally join are told they are saving women\u2019s souls by using every means necessary to prevent the death of a fetus. They are fed feel-good stories about how couples who are super devoted to movement, known as \u201cThe Select\u201d, have adopted X or Y number of babies, proving that no fetus is really unwanted. The numbers are always large but still short of shocking so they can seem attainable. Sort of the familial version of owning a Mercedes or vacationing in Singapore. Something to aspire to.\n\nThe truth is much darker. The founders took Jesus\u2019 commandment to eat of his body and drink of his blood very literally, and work tirelessly to maintain a steady supply of \u201cbread\u201d and \u201cwine\u201d. Their motto means \u201cBlessed be the fruit of your womb.\u201d and they believe the \u201cfruit\u201d must not be picked until it is ripe. The Select are in charge of procuring said \u201cfruit\u201d from other states and then helping it get lost in the system.\n\nEdit: It occurs to me that I shouldn\u2019t just say wild shit without making it clear that I\u2019m kidding. These are wild times and some people actually spout shit like this with a straight face.",

Once you start thinking like that, then compulsory euthanasia follows automatically. Killing babies after they have born becomes ethical as well.

I don't think there should be laws against abortion but to try and say it is a right is also a huge stretch. You can not have a right to take a life. And if the mothers life was in danger than the abortion would be the treatment to ensure she would live. The vast majority of abortions. I am talking over 90%, are done as a form of birth control. That might be uncomfortable to hear but it is the truth. That is what is wrong, that is what people hate. Don't make it a right take it case by case like you just suggested.",

To a Democrat \"a rose is a rose is a rose\" but call a rose a red schnurffle to a Republican and it's a wholly different plant.  It's almost a wise strategy at this point to give what should be a popular Democrat policy one name that's super catchy and repeatable, let it get beat to shit under that name, call it something else less catchy the next time and watch it pass.",

When studying for it, you\u2019re on edge the whole time, it\u2019s really difficult to snap out of crunch mode and roll with having the piss taken out of you lol. \n\nI will say he\u2019s right about the law, and luckily bar exam graders don\u2019t check spelling *that* carefully. They have way too much to read and review and not enough time to do it (it takes ~3-4 mos to get your score back\u2026). \n\nFor those who care and are interested, each answer I wrote for each of the essay questions (3 questions per section, each section is 4 hours of exam time) was ~20pgs in length. And I took the CA Bar Exam back when it was still 3 days long so there were 2 essay sections (6 questions total, now it\u2019s just the 3). \n\nSo I had written the page-count equivalent of *The Old Man and the Sea* for the essay section of the exam **alone**. And roughly 4,000 people take the CA Bar Exam each year. There are not 4,000 people grading the Bar Exam each year. \n\nWhen your exam gets graded, the graders are basically skimming your answer and scanning for a handful of criteria - certain key words, stating the law correctly, correct analysis of the facts and conclusions of the outcome based on that, and generally checking to make sure it\u2019s written coherently and with basic grammar and punctuation.\n\n So if you wrote, \u201c**Defendant would prevail** on an **affirmative defense** citing **self-defense** despite having **killed a human** with **malice aforethought** that would otherwise constitute **first degree murder**, because Defendant **reasonably believed** that Plaintiff was placing Defendant in **imminent danger of great bodily harm or death** based on Plaintiff pulling a gun and threatening to kill the Defendant,\u201d then everything that\u2019s not in bold would basically get ignored by the grader. \n\nThe bolded stuff consists of the statutory elements of either a self-defense claim or of a first degree murder charge, and states the outcome of the case based on those elements as applied to the facts. Those would basically be on a checklist in the grading rubric that the graders follow, and they literally just skim the answers and look for those phrases/terms of art/legal conclusions. \n\nMinor spelling mistakes are rarely noticed, and unless they make the answer unreadable, you won\u2019t lose points. So while it sounds silly a law student prepping for the Bar Exam would misspell \u201cchime\u201d, it actually does make sense because you\u2019re really trying to focus your brain **only** on what you\u2019ll be graded on - because there\u2019s so much material, fixing minor spelling mistakes wastes time that could be used to answering the question more fully.",

                      "text": "Well state actors have sovereign immunity in instances like this. Basically, there\u2019s a general (but not absolute) principle under US law that you can\u2019t sue the government unless they consent to that lawsuit. Sounds like it\u2019s impossible to ever sue the government, but obviously that happens all the time (it\u2019s how most social change is effected in this country). The consent simply comes from the Constitution and various statutes that the government passes into law. \n\nSo in instances like carrying out the death penalty, the government has basically said, \u201cyou can\u2019t sue us for killing you in this very precise, pre-determined method of execution, but you can sue us if we negligently, recklessly or intentionally deviate from that method of execution.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s effectively what a death penalty statute is. It\u2019s an immunity the government affords itself from being sued for murder or having murder laws enforced against it if specific conditions are satisfied.\n\nSo, yes, it\u2019s still \u201cmurder\u201d when the state performs the death penalty. Someone intentionally takes the life of another human being with premeditation. It\u2019s just a *justified* murder, similar to how murder in self-defense is a justified murder. They\u2019re justified because society has deemed the actions of the defendant to serve some societal benefit.\n\nFor self-defense, the societal benefit is you can defend yourself with lethal force if faced with a threat to your life. For the death penalty, society has deemed it beneficial to be able to execute criminals for certain sufficiently heinous crimes. So society has deemed murders in self-defense or pursuant to the death penalty to be justified, even though their actions are otherwise illegal, and we know society feels that way because their representative democracies passed legislation codifying self-defense and death penalty statutes which override the existing murder statutes.\n\nAs an aside, there are also *excused* murders (or excused crimes, generally). That\u2019s when the argument is the defendant should not be held guilty because they should not be responsible for their behavior. \n\nFor example, if the defendant had a psychotic break and hallucinated that their best friend is a demon from Hell, so the Defendant took a knife and stabbed their friend in the heart to \u201cslay the demon in the name of God and Jesus Christ\u201d but in reality just murdered their friend. \n\nYes, the defendant intended to killed his friend and it was murder. But the defendant was experiencing a psychotic episode which distorted his perception of reality, and without that, would never have murdered his friend, so society excuses that particular act of murder because the Defendant was not of sound mind and thus not truly responsible for his actions. \n\nIt\u2019s not justified murder, though, because society doesn\u2019t place any benefit on \u201ckilling demons in the name of God and Jesus Christ\u201d (at least not yet lol). The act itself isn\u2019t justified, just that the defendant\u2019s actions are excused because they should not be held responsible for their actions at the time.",

I had a brilliant criminal law professor in law school, but I went the corporate transactional route so I simply retained what she taught me really well (and which I reinforced while studying for the Bar years ago). \n\nThe law and legal system makes a lot more sense when you understand small nuances like this. It\u2019s not a perfect system by any means, and is certainly vulnerable to corruption, but you can\u2019t bring perfect order to a chaotic world filled with free-willed individuals. \n\nWhat we have sucks, but it\u2019s better than any other system before it and, over time, it *does* improve and progress - even when it looks like it\u2019s regressing and degenerating when viewed on a smaller time scale.",

Manslaughter = an unintentional homicide. (Generally speaking, at least, as some unintentional homicides are elevated to murder and some intentional homicides are dropped down to manslaughters.) \n\nBoth murder and manslaughter are homicides. So yes, \u201cmurder\u201d and \u201chomicide\u201d are synonymous in the same manner a square is a rectangle. \n\n>\tbecause the definition of murder is unlawful homicide. \n\nThat\u2019s not the legal definition. Manslaughter is also \u201cunlawful homicide\u201d, as previously established. \n\nAnd claiming self-defense in court means you\u2019re asserting an \u201caffirmative defense\u201d, which shifts the burden of proof from the prosecution onto the defendant.\n\nMeaning, the prosecutor no longer needs to prove you murdered someone. You did murder someone. You\u2019re admitting to intentionally killing another human. There is no dispute over that, because you can\u2019t claim self-defense if you\u2019re also claiming you didn\u2019t intentionally kill someone. If you shoot someone dead, you cannot claim you intended to shoot them dead in order to save your life while also asserting you did not intent to shoot them dead. \n\nThat murder is either justified, or it\u2019s not. It\u2019s still murder. If you\u2019re claiming it was done in self-defense, *you* have to prove that it was justified. Regardless of whether you can do that, you still committed murder, you just can\u2019t be found guilty of that murder if you prove it was justified by self-defense. \n\nAnd if you don\u2019t like calling it \u201cjustified murder\u201d and want to insist on calling it \u201cjustified homicide\u201d, then that wouldn\u2019t be wrong, but it wouldn\u2019t be the most precise and most correct way to categorize it.

They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past.\u201d\n\n>\u2015 Jean-Paul Sartre\n\nYou throw out easily debunked nonsense, give vague replies, refuse to explain anything and try to end the conversation.

People are free to speculate which one would be the case.\n\nA possible reason for trying to change the definition is to sugarcoat the procedure for people against abortions in case where it may be medically necessary. \n\u201cNo no no, this isn\u2019t \u2018abortion.\u2019 This is a medical procedure to terminate an unviable pregnancy for the health of the mother.\u201d\n\nHowever, if she represents the state of Ohio, then she should have no reason to be wrong about the law.

I would argue that actually does make her less evil.

By treating the death of the fetus as an unfortunate side effect of an attempt to save the mother, rather than it being a surgery to deliberately terminate it's life.\n\nShe is essentially saying the abortion was an unfortunate instance of the equivalent of killing someone in self defense.

When you are forced to kill a person, there is nothing deliberate about it, you didn't plan for the person's death, you were forced into killing the person.\n\nShe does not think being forced into having an abortion on pain of death, is the same as deliberately terminating the pregnancy, as she is acting on a threat to her life.\n\n>Similarly, abortion doesn't require that you intend to terminate a pregnancy, it just requires that you do so.\n\nNo, it requires it to be a deliberate act to terminate a pregnancy. meaning planned and with intent.\n\n>Pregnancies abort ask the time without anyone meaning to cause them. Another name for a miscarriage is a spontaneous abortion. Again, no intent.\n\nYes, and with a different name too, one which specifically relies on it not being caused by a deliberate action.\n\nIt is the difference between shooting someone to death, and someone dying from complications during during a heart surgery. Only one of those was the deliberate ending of a life.\n\nShe is disagreeing with you saying a forced abortion is a deliberate choice. She has no choice.\n\n>She doesn't get to make up her own definition. Abortion is a well defined medical term. Further, she isn't disagreeing, she is lying. She knows (or should know at least considering she's testifying to congress) what an abortion is as does every medical professional. When you know what you're saying is untrue, we call that a lie.\n\nShe is not defining anything, she is disagreeing that a forced termination of a fetus is a deliberate act. She has no choice.\n\nIs she wrong in her interpretation? If i run at you with a knife, and you shoot me. Did you deliberately kill me, or did i force you to do so upon pain of death?\n\nIt is only murder if you deliberately set out to kill me.\n\nShe is saying it is only an abortion if you **deliberately** set out to kill the fetus. That is in line with the current definition of an abortion.",

Not a pleasant one, but one regularly choosen by the depressed and birthing mothers(not super common, but not unheard of for pregnant mothers to disregard doctors recommendations to die if they might preserve the life of the baby).

Strange? Yes. Batshit crazy? Yes. A little evil? Maybe. But stupid? Sadly, no. If she were simply stupid I might still be friends with her today.\n\nHere are some fun tidbits about Catherine:\n\nShe assumes everyone hates her unless they explicitly tell her otherwise.\n\nShe pressured my friend into getting into a serious relationship very quickly, cut him off from his friends, and pressured him into having sex despite him being deeply religious and believing in waiting until marriage (I obviously can't confirm that last part, but my friend is one of the most honest people I know and I see no reason for him to lie on that front)\n\nWhen she eats french fries she prods them with her middle finger and only eats the ones she deems \"mooshy\" enough to consume.\n\nShe refers to her father as bio-dad despite the fact that he raised her and her mother didn't marry her stepfather until she was in her late teens.\n\nWe attended a conservative Christian college, but I never knew her to be particularly religious. In fact, she acted weirdly surprised when she saw me looking up something in the Bible once. I don't think she attended church and she majored in history and French, not religion.\n\nShe dumped my friend a couple years into their relationship with no warning and within months was married to another guy. She began attending classes in see-through clothes and acting completely nuts.\n\nShe and that guy got divorced pretty quickly and she has since been married at least once more, possibly twice?\n\nI've never met another human being so terrified of roaches. One night we were in her dorm room and one crawled on the wall. Her friend who was also there squealed a bit and I laughed because bugs don't bother me. Catherine screamed like someone was killing her. She screamed and cried and shrieked until people who were outside the building came running in because they thought someone was dying. She was inconsolable for hours.\n\nShe was anti-abortion in college but wasn't terribly vocal about it. I was actually surprised to learn it because she was otherwise fairly progressive at the time. I made a comment about being pro-choice and said something to the extent of everyone in the group being on the same page. She grew alarmed and said, \"No!\" in a horrified voice.\n\nShe had imaginary friend who was a cat named Jean-Pierre Extraordinaire. She made pictures of him and hung them outside her dorm room.\n\nThis is just a sample of what I experienced with her. I haven't seen her in years and she cut off all her college friends, so I have no idea what she's up to these days... besides this garbage.",

Does it matter if a 32 week fetus is alive? No one is having an abortion at that point just because they don't want to give birth.

We don't even classify people as dead or alive based on just brain activity.\n\n>Back it up with some evidence like you did before.\n\nYes mate, I'm not gonna bother retyping a text book for you. If you really think the only thing that changes with birth is position then you won't be able to understand most of it any way lol. Surely you can Google something like (how does a fetus change after birth)\n\n>Abortions would go down not everyone who was going to have an abortion will now that it\u2019s restricted. \n\nExcept they don't, not in a statistically significant way, that was the whole paper lol, that was the only thing I claimed was in the paper \n\n>You are so full of yourself you just can\u2019t admit that maybe it\u2019s more complicated than \u201cMy BoDy My ChOiCe\u201d\n\nSure I can, by discussing things such as post birth changes you still don't believe exist, what it means to be alive beyond an overly simplistic understanding, and how laws actually affect real people beyond what \"feels\" correct without understanding the actual data.",

                                  "text": "As an ordained minister of Christianity, I figure I am something of an expert on souls. Allow me to help you digest some information.\n\nFirst off, we have Exodus. It should be noted, that Exodus is filled with laws that no longer apply (it says its only for a specific tribe of Israel as long as Aaron and his sons are still alive). However, there is a part which mentions the penalty for hitting a pregnant woman and causing a miscarriage. If the baby dies, it is a fine. If there is any damage to the mother, the government will damage the person equally. Thats the famous verse \"eye for eye, tooth for tooth, burn for burn, life for life\". Again, this is from Exodus, but we can assume that, if a fetus is a human life, it wouldn't make sense for the punishment to killing a fetus to be a mere fine, while the punishment for killing the mother is death. This shows that God clearly values a fetus as signiricantly less than a human life, and thus that a fetus is not a human life. \n\nThen we have Numbers. In the book of Numbers it describes something known as the ordeal of bitter water, where it instructs priests to give a pregnant woman a bitter tincture which will cause her to miscarry, if she is pregnant with a fetus conceived of adultery. \n\nFurthermore, there are many parts of the Bible which says that a human is granted a soul when it breathes the breath of life, or the breath of God, quite clearly implying that life begins at first breath. See \u2014Job 33:4 - The spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty gives me life.\u2014, or \u2014Genesis 2:7 (NIV) - Then the\u00a0Lord\u00a0God formed\u00a0a man\u00a0from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath\u00a0of life, and the man became a living being.\u2014. Some translations of Genesis 2:7 are even more specific, such as the LDS version \"And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of Life; and man became living soul.\" Without the Breath of Life, we are no more than tissue; a hollow organism with no intrinsic soul. God even accounts for that by giving us somatosensory organs and sensation a month or so before birth, so that there can be no scientific or religious question as to whether the human being is alive. This ensures that by the time we have spiritual life, any scientist would also declare that we have biological life and sentience. \n\nIf a human has not breathed, we can therefore assume that it has no soul. If it has no immortal soul, then it is not a human. \n\nWe hear common rebuttals, such as \u2014Jeremiah 1:5 - Before I formed you in the womb I knew\u00a0you, before you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations.\u2014 but this is not really enough to determine it. You see, God knew everything that was and ever will be from the beginning of creation, as he is omniscient. He knows the future, and all that will be. In much the same way that God would not call someone's to Heaven if they would be revived in a hospital hours later, he would not appoint a fetus that would die before their first breath, as God knew that that fetus was destined to die.",
