  "text": "TIFU by letting my pregnant wife find out what submarines are really all about.\nSo, the obligatory \u201cthis happened before my wife recently gave birth to our 2nd child, and hormones were off the charts\u201d.\n\nMy very pregnant wife wakes up and I am already awake, having made coffee for myself and prepared tea in anticipation for a relaxed morning.   I\u2019m watching a PBS special about WWII submarines and she sat down with her tea and started to watch.   \n\nSo my wife isn\u2019t a huge history buff and I am constantly reminding her of the order of commonly-known events.   She is incredibly intelligent but she apparently had a very boring history teacher and never absorbed the information.  As such, she had no idea that submarines\nwere actually torpedo-carrying murder machines that were designed to blow up their enemies.  \n\nI look at her and she\u2019s bawling\u2026tears running down her face and she says, \u201cBut I thought submarines were just like for exploration and fun and stuff.\u201d  I chalk it up to hormones, but I really ruined a nice morning.\n\nTL;DR made my pregnant wife cry when she found out that submarines are war machines\n\nEdit:\n\nWow, went to sleep and this got a bit hairy.   Thank you to those who understand pregnancy brain and found this as cute, albeit shocking as I did. No thank you to those who went straight to calling my wife horrible things or assuming anything else about her, and a big FU to those saying anything mean about my kids.  Without going into much detail, yes, she had a sheltered childhood where she didn\u2019t encounter submarines all too often, in the water, on land, or in the media.  I guess her parents never gave her the \u201csubmarine talk\u201d.  She does in fact know a lot more about the grisly details of war now, as we have been trying to get her up to date, especially about the world wars.  She may have had an inkling before that submarines were evil, but I don\u2019t think it was something she wanted to hear that morning.  Pretty sure she thought they were used in war, but just for spying on the enemy. Be nice, and may you all keep your heads above water.",

It never bothered me that he didn\u2019t want the llamas I found but when I looked over at his screen and saw that after complaining so much, he was actually building a pen for my llamas, I started crying.

Like, the risks associated with pregnancy make it such that HBC is absolutely worth it IF it\u2019s the woman\u2019s choice.\n\nBut it\u2019s so very fucked up that so often it\u2019s less her choice and more \u201che says condoms make it feel less good\u201d while she\u2019s like, not even into it and in fucking pain every time because the BC tanked her libido and made her dry as the Sahara. And truly, you\u2019re LUCKY if those are the only two side-effects you get. \n\nI find it depressingly hilarious that one of the most common side effects of HBC is lowered libido when a lot of people take it specifically because they\u2019re having sex. It\u2019s like, way to reinforce the old-school notion that sex is something for men to enjoy and women to tolerate.\n\nWe really need to make sure to NOT shut up about how much HBC can suck until we have more options than trying to bargain with men to take responsibility (which tbf, many will without issue, but still) or the copper IUD, which like all IUDs, they usually insert with zero pain management because fuck women\u2019s pain, apparently.\n\nSorry - that was a bit of a rant and it\u2019s good to hear that the pill was ultimately the wife\u2019s choice, but despite there being many men who are sympathetic and get this, there\u2019s still so many that don\u2019t and/or refuse to and it\u2019s like actually infuriating. Like, going through all this, for a man, so it can feel\u2026even better for him. All while you\u2019re dealing with the aforementioned side effects and like\u2026.the orgasm gap is still a thing. \n\nIt just makes me so angry how expected it is. \n\nOkay I\u2019m done now, sorry. Truly not wanting to personally accuse anyone here of being like this, but people need to understand that it really is like this for many if not a majority of women who use BC so it can change.",

I wish I never took it but I would still be on it had my little man not happened. It sucks that I was started on it so young though, I straight up spent a good few years just thinking I had something wrong with me that was triggered by puberty.

Context is incredibly important. \n\nCheck the Cleveland Clinic discussion.  But this requires an ACTUAL READ THROUGH AND SOME FACILITY WITH STATISTICS AND a passing introduction to the concept of comorbidity\n\n\nCleveland Clinic discussion on relative risks of blood clots from hormonal birth control versus risks from pregnancy\n\n(https://www.google.com/amp/s/health.clevelandclinic.org/yes-your-birth-control-could-make-you-more-likely-to-have-a-blood-clot/amp/)\n\nJust like taking an aspirin increases risks for bleeding, we have to report even the SMALLEST association. \n\nIt needs to be estrogen containing, and the risk is still VERY SMALL, and again, much less risky than a pregnancy. \n\nSo in weighing options if the \u201cavoiding the worse health risk\u201d is the desired outcome, then remain NOT PREGNANT at great effort. It is leagues safer to be not pregnant than to be pregnant, not to mention all the complications that can come with birth and then oh raising a human being\n\nBut if you only temporarily want to be not pregnant because taking on the pregnancy risk has an appeal to you eventually\u2026 then you identify strategies. \n\n1. Complete and utter abstinence- great for not pregnant, maybe not so great for relationship sustaining.\n2. Hormonal Birth control where the woman develops a plan with HER physician who knows HER family history. Aunt Jenny stroking out from clots a few generations ago might make you think twice\u2026 but think woman (in many states) are still allowed to do. ACCEPT A Small risk to avoid the MUCH BIGGER risks from an actual pregnancy\n\n3. Back we come to. For any man who is so worried about the risks of the pill, but not scared basically shitless about the actual risks of pregnancy, should be more worried about the latter.  The inherent risks to the woman throughout the gestation and birth are staggering in proportion to \u201cthe pill\u201d. \n\n4. So here we end with the ONLY way to not have reliable birth control (with its minor risks) in the bodies of woman NOT wanting to become pregnant?  \n\n(Drumroll) Turn off the tap fellas.

This episode is why I went back to rewatch the whole thing. \n\nA lot of people like to bring up the \"where do you think we are\" moment from the medical comedy Scrubs for driving home that particular difficulty.\n\nIt's not about the form of media, it's how it makes you experience those emotions. I hope you and your wife are living a happy life, but if not, I am glad you want to help even if you don't know how. You're not supposed to know how. You aren't even supposed to try, but I'm sure you did because...what else can you do when someone is hurting?",

It wasn't exactly a time of peace so military was always looking for new ideas to fund. (most failed terribly).   And inventors always looking for new ways to help.

It used a series of leather bladers to control buoyancy. In a public demonstration it traveled up the Thames River. However it is disputed weather it counts as a true submarine because it was not able to fully submerge. It still required a small section to sit at the water line in order to function. \n\nthe first submarine to be used in combat, was actually built and used during the American revolution. The [Turtle was an American invention](https://i0.wp.com/www.revolutionarywarjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Turtle-2.png?w=728&ssl=1) it was a fully submersible, man powered, wooden submarine with a single crew member, that used hand pumps to control buoyancy and hand spun screws for propulsion.\n\nOn September 7th 1776, the Turtle was piloted into the Hudson River carrying a powder keg equipped with a clockwork time fuse. It aproched the HMS Eagle, a heavily armed British war ship, and attempted to attach the keg to the bottom of the ship using a large had operated drill, howevere it could not penetrate the thick reinforced wood of the Eagle, and had to abandon the mission, though the keg was still primed and left, it drifted away before detonating resulting in minimal damage to the ship.",

                  "text": "This is not true, at least for most of the nuclear weapons in the world. For the US nuclear arsenal, there\u2019s roughly 2000 warheads in service. About 1400 of these are on the 14 Ohio class SSBNs, with only 450 ground based ICBMs, and only 60 strategic aircraft  (I\u2019m not including tactical weapons and their delivery systems here) capable of launching nuclear cruise missiles or dropping nuclear gravity bombs. So the vast majority of the US\u2019s nuclear arsenal is on submarines. The UK and France don\u2019t have any ground based nuclear weapons at all, with the UK exclusively using submarine launched ballistic missiles, and with France also operating mostly submarine launched ballistic missiles with a small amount of aircraft delivered weapons. Israel obviously doesn\u2019t put out any information about their arsenal, but it\u2019s speculated that most of their nuclear weapons are deployed on diesel electric submarines, and probably with a few aircraft delivered weapons. No ground based weapons with Israel. \n\nFor the rest of the countries with nuclear arsenals, it\u2019s more of an even mix of ground and sea based weapons, and some countries do rely primarily on ground based weapons. North Korea presumably only has ground based nuclear weapons, considering they don\u2019t have much of a submarine fleet that could handle nuclear weapons. China also appears to primarily rely on ground based launchers, but up until lately their nuclear arsenal has remained fairly small. Russia uses a mix of sea and ground based launchers, but one can assume they\u2019re trying to move more of their weapons onto submarines, with the new Borei class SSBNs they\u2019ve been building lately. India and Pakistan have relatively small arsenals, but India has been building up their submarine fleet lately, so it\u2019s assumed that they\u2019re trying to have most of their weapons deployed at sea. \n\nSo the trend as of the end of the Cold War has been to have most of a nation\u2019s arsenal at sea on submarines. The only exceptions to this trend are nations with very small arsenals (North Korea, Pakistan), as well as countries who haven\u2019t had the industrial capacity to build their own classes of nuclear powered submarines. Russia nearly completely lost their ability to build nuclear powered submarines in the 1990\u2019s, and barely held on to Sevmash, which today is the only shipyard in Russia that builds nuclear powered submarines. China only in the last decade has begun to build up their Navy, and they also didn\u2019t have much of a nuclear arsenal until recently either.",

The B-52 can still deliver nuclear weapons, but since that aircraft is so vulnerable today, the USAF only deploys it with short range nuclear cruise missiles. The idea here is that there\u2019s no way a B-52 can make it to its target over an enemy nation since it\u2019s so slow and obvious on radar, so it gets most of the way there and then launches the cruise missiles, which are much harder to prosecute. Then there\u2019s the B-2 stealth bomber, which is the only aircraft in the US arsenal that deploys strategic gravity bombs. There are only two types of gravity bombs left in the US arsenal, the B61 and the B83. The B83 is supposed to be pulled out of service and retired soon, which is going to leave the B61 as the only remaining nuclear gravity bomb for the US. There\u2019s only 600 of the strategic model of this weapon in the arsenal, which is dwarfed by the missile warheads in the US nuclear arsenal.",

But bombs on a giant bomber plane are not really viable anymore.. icbms may be somewhat delicate, but that is why there are so many thousands. And each missile deploys like 20 warheads. And each target gets multiple missiles/warheads aimed at them for exactly this reason. That's why the arsenal is so big. You can't assure mutual destruction if you only launch a few or just enough, cause some will get shot down, fail at launch/reentry, targets will be hardemed or get lucky, some even may not explode. So you destroy each target 10 times over",

The name references the Bible story where Samson is taken captive by the Philistines and collapses their giant temple with with himself inside, taking them all out. I doubt this is still Israeli policy, it cane about when Israel was fighting the Arab wars and felt like no one had its back.",

So many medical advancements are made for the battlefield, and heck the interstate system is based around a military convoy, military logistics and racism. The space race was operated on rockets that were slightly modified from carrying warheads. What would eventually lead to the internet was developed for data sharing  for military research",

I won't say troublesome, but there might be some hurdles and hoops for you along the way.\n\nWall of text warning.\n\nDisclaimer: These were requested by my in-laws.  My parents on the other hand couldn't care less.\n\nExample 1: Before we set on the actual wedding day, we had to bring our birthdays and the birthdays of all the parents to a \"fortune teller\", so she could find the best date for the wedding.  I still remember a few basic rules:\n\n1) The wedding day cannot be on the same month as all the parties involved.  So in the worse case scenario, 6 out of 12 months are out.  Good thing my parents share the same birth month, so does my wife and I.  So for us, only 4 of 12 are out.\n\n2) Can't be in the same month as the Chinese New Year and the Ghost Festival.  So January and July (in the Lunar Calendar) are out.\n\nOnly half a year are out of the question, not too bad huh?\n\nThere were also a few more rules, but those concepts are too high up for a mere mortal like me to grasp.\n\nWe ended up getting a few dates to choose from and we settled on a fall wedding.\n\nExample 2: The other quite minor thing I had to do was to \"settle the bed\".  Apparently, the time and date the bed is placed affects your fortune (dont ask me the details, I only executed the order).  It's not as bad it sounds, the bed frame was placed and the mattress was actually on the bed frame already.  But the mattress was not set on the bed frame quite right, so all I had to do was to push it to the correct position at the specified time (and I had to bow  to the four corner, and some other things that I already forgot)\n\nI don't remember the date, but the time was between 5-7 am.  It was a new apartment and was not furnished.  As I lived an hour away, I chose to stay overnight.  And while there was a completely new and comfy mattress, I couldn't use it.\n\nAt least the couch was delivered and internet was installed the day before.\n\nI ended up sleeping on the couch, woke up at 5, bow the corners, did some other stuff, nudged the mattress to the correct position and went back to sleep.\n\nAnd there are some more little procedures... but it's not bad once you change your mindset and just go with the flow.",

Bumblebees are cute and chill bro, I've literally pettet a bumblebee and it didn't care. My neighbour has a nest on the house, those things are everywhere and I've never heard of a single accident, they're seriously the least aggressive stingers and 50% of them can't even hurt you (I think it was only females).

Eleven hundred men went into the water. Vessel went down in 12 minutes. Didn't see the first shark for about a half-hour. Tiger. 13-footer. You know how you know that in the water, Chief? You can tell by lookin' from the dorsal to the tail.\n\nWhat we didn't know, was that our bomb mission was so secret, no distress signal had been sent. They didn't even list us overdue for a week. Very first light, Chief, sharks come cruisin' by, so we formed ourselves into tight groups. It was sorta like you see in the calendars, you know the infantry squares in the old calendars like the Battle of Waterloo and the idea was the shark come to the nearest man, that man he starts poundin' and hollerin' and sometimes that shark he go away... but sometimes he wouldn't go away.\n\nSometimes that shark looks right at ya. Right into your eyes. And the thing about a shark is he's got lifeless eyes. Black eyes. Like a doll's eyes. When he comes at ya, he doesn't even seem to be livin'... 'til he bites ya, and those black eyes roll over white and then... ah then you hear that terrible high-pitched screamin'. The ocean turns red, and despite all your poundin' and your hollerin' those sharks come in and... they rip you to pieces. You know by the end of that first dawn, lost a hundred men. I don't know how many sharks there were, maybe a thousand. I do know how many men, they averaged six an hour.\n\nThursday mornin', Chief, I bumped into a friend of mine, Herbie Robinson from Cleveland. Baseball player. Boson's mate. I thought he was asleep. I reached over to wake him up. He bobbed up, down in the water, he was like a kinda top. Upended. Well, he'd been bitten in half below the waist. At noon on the fifth day, a Lockheed Ventura swung in low and he spotted us, a young pilot, lot younger than Mr. Hooper here, anyway he spotted us and a few hours later a big ol' fat PBY come down and started to pick us up. You know that was the time I was most frightened. Waitin' for my turn. I'll never put on a lifejacket again. So, eleven hundred men went into the water. 316 men come out, the sharks took the rest, June the 29th, 1945.\n\nAnyway, we delivered the bomb.'",

Her fianc\u00e9 at the time was a firefighter working 3 days on 4 days off she was close to her due date so during the 3 days on she would stay with us. Plus I think she was just bored as shit and tired of being pregnant. Her cravings were chocolate chip cookie dough, and crunchy. Didn\u2019t matter what the crunchy was just needed to have a satisfying level of crunch. We were watching tv she was munching away on ice cause crunch. I realized I had everything to make chocolate chip cookie dough so I made a batch. This set her off crying because it was the nicest thing anyone had ever done for her. Then she was crying because it was to good to eat and she didn\u2019t want to eat it. Then she was crying cause she couldn\u2019t stop eating and she was fat. Never mind the fact we walked like five miles that day between just walking cause supposed to help with labor, and going to the store to find crunchy. I was still in high school and my cousin was never a crier growing up so I thought something was wrong. Called my mom at work to ask for help she just laughed and said your helping already.",

I've visited two museum submarines from the Gato and Balao-classes (there's one in Pearl Harbor Memorial in Hawaii and another next to the Intrepid in NYC), both of which served during WW2.  Those two classes are significantly smaller and have only a single hull of 2 or less inches separating the crew from the icy depths of the ocean.  Modern submarines have dual hulls; an inner hull for people and an outer hull that's filled with void spaces and ballast tanks.\n\nI can only imagine the complete utter fear and despair of the crew during WW2 when their sub gets sunk from depth charges or sea mines and have less than 15 minutes of breathing air before all compartments flood.\n\nYour wife was partially right: the deep sea exploration stuff was popularized by Jacques Cousteau post-WW2 buuuut the cold hard truth is that military funding drives human innovation.  The Nazi concentration camps gave us information on stuff like how long a person can survive in subzero conditions and hypothermia; Unit 731 gave modern medicine a better understanding of biological warfare.",

Combination of starting off knowing absolutely nothing, having a horrible memory for dates, boring teachers, finding the subject in general boring\u2026 \nFor example, I remember starting history class very young and talking about War, and different battles, and being MIND BLOWN that there were battles? Up until then I had thought that war was just\u2026 constant shooting? And since history is like math, where it builds on itself, and I got pretty lost on a lot of basic stuff because teachers assumed I knew, and I was too embarrassed to ask\u2026 and now im an adult with a science degree and a big girl job doing important stuff, but didn\u2019t know stuff about wars for a long long time. So, yeah, maybe I can\u2019t tell you about when Submarines were first used for war and attack, but I can tell you about what happens when different chemicals interact with each other and why. \n\nIm glad that OP is still very supportive of his wife, cause now im not totally in the dark about history as I used to be thanks to my lovely husband who\u2019s willing to start from the beginning and tell it to me like a story. Don\u2019t punish good behavior, SHES LEARNING! Isn\u2019t that what you want?",

Its not something taught in schools, either in my youth or today. The most successful submarine campaign ever against merchant cargo ships wasn't carried out by the Germans but by the US against Japanese in World War II. By mid 1944 Japan was running out of fuel and materials to fully supply their army and navy.  But since unrestricted warfare (sinking merchant ships without warning them first) was one of the crimes we accused the Germans of doing, the US didn't want to admit that it had done the same thing only better, so it really wasn't taught.",

I\u2019m a rule follower anyways, and definitely not the type to take more risk when pregnant, so I correctly waddled my way to get my precious churros. In the time it took me to get there, they brought the cute little chairs and tables inside, then flipped the sign to \u201cclosed\u201d and locked the door. It was like a slow motion horror movie and I huffed, \u201cnooo, nooooo, NOOOOO!\u201d as I tried to get there in time. I bawled my eyes out like an idiot. My husband walked out of the store across the street and saw me pathetically crying, he did not judge me. I will always appreciate that because it was so stupid but also how did they close up shop so fast?",

Two people who learn the same history curriculum can have a vastly different takeaway depending on external factors like how engaging the class is, whether or not they grew up in a family that encourages learning about these things, or even whether or not they got enough sleep the night before. \n\n\nWhy are we so hard on people for not knowing things?

Even movies and television gloss over the details at best, if not omit them entirely. So I'm not at all surprised that your otherwise intelligent, informed wife wouldn't have understood, even on an intellectual level let alone an emotional level, what horror war actually is. Not her fault, not *your* fault, not anybodys' fault, really, it just *is*. It's good though that she does understand, though, and if more people understood about that all over the world then perhaps we wouldn't have crap like what's happening in Ukraine right now, for instance.",

I'm sure there's a named fallacy for that. \n\nAnyway, I went to a Derren Brown show last night and he made the point that 80% of people consider themselves to be above average, and that in itself is an impossibility.\n\n I just feel it takes an absolute void of critical thinking to let stuff pass you by without ever being able to infer purpose or context until it has been directly spelled out for you, such as in OPs example.

You simply made a (quite spectacularly unlikely) hypothetical case in which someone hadn't ever heard of military subs, completely eliding the central point that intelligence is about inference, and intelligent people think broadly and infer accurately, even when they don't have specifics to hand. Someone who does not is not being intelligent. We can't all be intelligent all the time - 50% of the population have an IQ < 100, after all.\n\nAnd of course I understand your point. In contrast I made an explicit concession on the point you're making in the opening sentence of my previous comment. I know this. I've *agreed* with it. I have not at any point said \"knowledge = intelligence\".\n\nBut it doesn't follow that knowledge and it's utilisation to infer things has *nothing* to do with intelligence which is the strong claim you are implicitly making. You seem to be arguing that no absence of knowledge, or absence of utilisation of existing knowledge, can possibly be used to infer some semblance of how engaged/smart/intelligent someone is. This is preposterous.\n\nAnd the clue is in your very response - \n\n\"that you have given no thought to\". \n\nYes. Precisely. That just re-packages my point.\n\nSmart people *think* about things. And they are less likely to miss obvious inferences given bog standard common knowledge, information from the news etc. etc. The more obvious the inference and the more exposed we are to the topic the less likely a smart person is to \"have given it no thought\" and/or arrived at a nonsense conclusion. This topic is both a very obvious inference and is on a topic that is borderline impossible to miss.",

If she\u2019s never really had reason to think about these things, why would she? It doesn\u2019t mean she can\u2019t make inferences, just that she hasn\u2019t dedicated any effort into that one. You may say she obviously has thought about subs because she had conceptualized them as doing something completely different, and should have realized then.

Am I missing any connections to the era and context in which they\u2019ve been used historically?\u201d She knew what subs are and what they were for, and she probably was aware they were in the war, and then just literally not lingered on that thought any longer to think \u201cwould it be practical to only use them for undetected transport? Or exploration?\u201d And then think of other reasons. You may think it\u2019s an easy jump, but I can guarantee you do not stop at every single piece of information you take in to consider whether you\u2019ve put enough thought into understanding it. Some people just do not care. I do not give a single shit about submarines, and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve never considered they had weapons, even though it makes sense when I hear it. It\u2019s just not something I\u2019ve bothered thinking any more deeply about than the face value of what I know/learn.\n\nAnd you just can\u2019t think about every implication of everything, all of the time.  You don\u2019t \u201cthink broadly\u201d about every topic you hear to make sure you\u2019ve made all the connections you can with everything else you know.

I bet if you asked her about something she is actually interested in she could tell you more than *you* know.\n\nYour continued insistence on someone else's lack of intelligence based on a single gap in their knowledge, despite the myriad ways people have tried to explain this to you, may not make you unintelligent, but it does make you look like a complete asshole.\n\nAll you have achieved here is proving that you judge people arbitrarily and lack the capacity to alter your views when presented with multiple scenarios in which your claim falls flat.\n\nSounds pretty stupid to me.",

There are no good books for seven-year-olds about pirates.  Pirates are like submarines, they just kill other sailors, burn the ships, and steal the cargo.  There's nothing more to them, really.  Except that \"privateers\" are commissioned by governments to capture the ships of other countries, and those books aren't written for seven-year-olds.",

You can take a history walking tour here, or read books about them.  But they are not children's books.  These men were not heroes or fun guys.  In the UK, do they tell seven-year-olds the truth about pirates, or glamorize them?  I would hope there are no fun books about pirates anywhere.  The books my customer was hoping to find were child-appropriate books about pirates.  There aren't any, unless they are ridiculous lies.",

Bombers, Subs and Silo\u2019s. Subs were the hardest to track and stop, though the USSR mobile launchers weren\u2019t easy targets either.) \nWar is horrible, but ironically it pushes technological development faster than almost any other endeavor. \nAirplanes, jet engines, rockets, medical treatments, radars to microwaves to computers and the internet were all pushed forward thanks to War time efforts.

And then crying, and then bawling her head off. Being six, and hating it when people cried sad tears, I went to investigate. I gave her a hug, and and went back to sesame street.\n\nMy dad told me this later, but apparently my mom was really sad that elmo had left her, because she somehow started thinking about him dying for some reason???
