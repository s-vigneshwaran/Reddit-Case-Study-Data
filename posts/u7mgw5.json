Lol\nLet's try it.\n\n\n\"The psychiatrist was the first to introduce the concept of menphobia, pointing to the hatred of man people and man culture\u00a0by man people themselves. Indeed, he asserts that\u00a0menphobia\u00a0is a form of \"trauma for women people of the man\". \nEquivalent to internalised racism caused by the trauma of living in a culture defining man people as inherently evil, Fanon emphasises the slight existing cultural intricacies caused by the vast diversity of man people and cultures, as well as the nature of their colonisation by women\u00a0Europeans. The symptoms of such black\u00a0manphobia\u00a0include a rejection of their native or ethnic language in favour of female\u00a0European languages, a marked preference for female\u00a0European cultures\u00a0over man cultures, and a tendency to surround themselves with softer skinned people rather than hard skinned ones.\n\nSimilarly, the pattern further includes attributing negative characteristics to man people, culture, and things.\u00a0Toni Morrison's novel\u00a0The Bluest Eye\u00a0(1970) stands as an illustrative work on the destroying effects of\u00a0Negrophobia\u00a0among the\u00a0man community\u00a0on themselves. Indeed, the main character, Pecola Breedlove, through his non-reconciliation with his man identity, her man societal indifference and her craving for symbolic blue eyes, presents all the signs of an internalised\u00a0Manhobia. \u00a0She develops an anti-man\u00a0neurosis\u00a0due to her feeling of non-existence both within the female and his own community.",

I'm not saying they wouldn't publish all sorts of bullshit, but it has to be properly refined bullshit.\n\nI think I still have a link to the Google drive with the papers they submitted if anyone is interested.",

Think: economic conservative, and a cheap, isolationist-outside-of-NATO hawk that doesn't give a shit what adults do in their bedrooms as long as it doesn't infringe on my liberties.   Like many I got pushed to the right because of today's authoritarian and batshit left.  I know centrists.\n\nYou cannot look ANYONE in the eye here and say that feminism was EVER centrist.  If you can, please tell us about the relationship between the Suffragettes and the White Feather movement.  The White Feathers were the OPPOSITE of centrists.  Oh, and most centrists believe in a balance of rights and responsibilities.  The original feminists wanted the right to vote, but zero parts of mustard gas. How convenient.\n\nAnd the 2nd wavers?  There's NO way they were centrists.  To be fair to them, the weakness of centrism is that we don't have enough violent force to affect social changes.  Centrism is great for a \"homeostasis\" of sorts.  But when you need society moved, the radicals are the only way forward. MLK needed X for this very reason.",

But this entire sub seems dedicated to how too many people are embracing feminist ideas. \n\nSo that would seem to imply that whether an idea or movement is left wing or right wing would have more to do with what the current mainstream social and political norms are. Not whether something has some ideological traces you might be able to trace back to the French Revolution.\n\nLeft-wing politics is commonly defined by a support social equality and egalitarianism, often in opposition of social hierarchy. Even if there are some traceable roots to the French ideology that isn\u2019t how it is defined.\n\n\n3. You think the left wing is defined be a movements relation to the French Revolution?\nAnything that descends from the ideology of French Revolution is by definition left wing?\n\n\u201cIn the mid-19th century, nationalism, socialism, democracy and anti-clericalism became key features of the French Left\u201d \n\n\u201cOtto Dann and John Dinwiddy report, \"It has long been almost a truism of European history that the French Revolution gave a great stimulus to the growth of modern nationalism\u201d\n\ndamn so nationalism and democracy are all left wing?

So which of them is always wrong about murder being bad.\n\n\u201cOne of the world\u2019s first anti-depressants was first synthesized in 1951, and used initially to treat tuberculosis. When clinicians found that some patients exhibited euphoria and hyperactive behaviour under the drug\u2019s influence, they revealed that it is a \u201cmonoamine oxidase inhibitor\u201d.\n\n\u201csildenafil citrate, a drug developed at a treatment for jet jag, had impacts below the belt.

Liberalism started to spread rapidly especially after the French Revolution. The 19th century saw liberal governments established in nations across Europe and South America, whereas it was well-established alongside republicanism in the United Words such as liberal, liberty, libertarian and libertine all trace their history to the Latin liber, which means \"free\".[22] One of the first recorded instances of the word liberal occurs in 1375, when it was used to describe the liberal arts in the context of an education desirable for a free-born man\u201d\n\n\n7.

Movements and ideas change.\n\nBase assumptions are the things that make things make sense, if you get rid of them or change them your ideology will stop making sense. So no amount of evolution will be able to overcome having incorrect base assumptions. This is why you struggle to follow my logic - we do not use the same base assumptions. Having a rigid logical structure simply allows using it as a skeleton for more complex arguments and thought. The only reason to have a relative position is to semantically overload a conversation, and have the opportunity to use underhanded tactics (not accusing you of deliberately doing it).\n\n> Is feminism based on socialism? If so how?\n\nSimone de Beauvoir, Sartre, Foucault ... All feminists and socialists. All three of them also signed a letter in support of abolishing the age of consent in France in 1977.\n\nThe problem with defining left-wing in relative terms is that it is not possible to accurately define, therefore it is a \"no true Scottsman\" fallacy and pointless. The only other way to define left-wing is through it's logical framework of \"narrative is more important than fact\" and taking up values by inverting traditionalism (which includes the idea of Magna Carter and from you own reference liberalism). In both of those feminism ends up being left-wing. \n\nA great example of the modern left staying true to its roots in the French revolution is the legislation proposed (I don\u2019t remember if it was passed or not) in California of unrestricted abortion up to birth in response to the Alabama\u2019s abortion ban.\n\nThe origin of left/right terminology is the separation by which side of the chamber you sit in is based on the French revolution, with the revolutionaries being on the left and them pushing everyone else to the right. This was later used to procecute people during \"the reign of terror\" - where we get the word terrorism from. During that period of time the revolutionaries delineated everything good as left-wing and everything bad as right-wing, simply to silence criticism as they did the things they claimed to be against. Ironically, it was a return to monarchy (Napoleon) that fulfilled the promises that the left-wing made.\n\nAnother feature of this same logic is the necessity of constant escalation, which is why you can see leftist periodically turning on eachother.\n\nDemocracy comes from ancient Greece and was thoroughly examined and considered a terrible way of governance (most notably by Plato) as it invariably devolves into mob rule and oligarchy. Your own reference states that the term liberal pre-dates the notion of separation into left and right. Therefore neither are a left-wing position. \n\nThe problem is the phrase \"modern nationalism\" which is to be contrasted with other forms of nationalism. Nationalism in terms of psychology is a form of ingroup preference and is a product of human instincts. This would indicate an attempt to semantically overload the term nationalism. If one puts this into full context \"modern nationalism\" is what we now call tribalism - meaning our side can do no wrong, as opposed to nationalism which considers justified criticism of itself a benefit.\n\nIf you want to really go into US history: Lincoln created the Republican Party a right-wing movement and lead the side that abolished slavery. Part of the main features of that party is conservatism, which goes against the narrative of \"the parties switched\". Also do not forget that Jim Crow laws were a democrat position.\n\nRousseau's position is simply succinct and easy to point to. It can be disassembled into \"noble savage\" and \"tabula rasa\", which can be seen in pretty much all romanticism philosophers, and used as a base assumption for the French revolution, which itself was used as a base assumption for other left-wing movements such as feminism. Very few examine their thoughts that deeply to understand this connection.\n\n>Christian\u2019s don\u2019t kill because of the Ten Commandments. God isn\u2019t provably real.\n\nThat's a problem of a simplistic view of religion. One of the things they share is the ability to maintain a society, and you need to have some things to make them function, and there are a limited number of ways that will produce an outcome that doesn't collapse a society. Religion does this through belief and trial and error, over 1000s of years, and rarely fully explains the how\u2019s and why\u2019s, which is their downfall.\n\nOn the drugs - it is knowledge of cause and effect, rather than a fault in logic. When those drugs were initially used not all of those effects were known, hence the changes in use. The scientific method didn\u2019t change.\n\nExamples of flaws in logic rather than a lack of knowledge are: the use of tobacco smoke enemas (until late 1800s) as a way of resuscitation after drowning and considering newborns not to feel pain.\n\n>You would have to assume rape and murder existed before advanced societies.\n\nYes, which is why that base assumption (Rousseau's position) is false, so are the ideologies based on it. Pointing out the flaws in base assumptions is often dismissed as a \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d despite it being factually accurate.",

They do the opposite!!\u201d\n\nIt stands to reason that if some gender roles are biological and some are societal, it would be worth exploring how they differ in different societies( and the similarities) and how different pre civilisation groups may have handled it. This isn\u2019t that unusual given that controlling women through marriage and reproductive is very tied to how property and rights were inherited. So if part of the core is women can be treated like property because biologically they are gatekeepers of how money and wealth and transfer.\nSo if that is so influential in thousands of years of culture you have to go back pretty far to find cultures unaffected by that.\n\n2. Ok you are a kiwi. Good for you.\nOther countries don\u2019t want your prime minister.\nThey what someone that knows their own countries politics.\n\n\n\n3.

Yes I imagine a class word cover what subject you are studying means.\nYou know, so you would know what the subject means before moving on to more advance ideas.\nIf you are going to debate on a topic you might want to gain at least a rudimentary understanding of the terms and ideas.\n\n4. Rosalind is entitled to her opinions. I\u2019m not familiar with her work.\nBut assuming her observation was true. Maybe part of the reason if it is difficult to dislodge deeply held perceptions is because they are deeply held. For thousands of years of culture and tradition. That will be tend to have an effect. It would be very hard to move people on from capitalism if we created a better system because over 200 years we have gotten pretty use to it. There was a time where monarchy and empire where since as the right and only way. Gods chosen bloodline of kings. Now we know that idea was just enforced by the beliefs of the time.\n\nHer quote seems a bit suss on the powerful Patriarch bit.\nReframing things or focusing and encouraging the common misconceptions.\nThe existence of patriarchy doesn\u2019t mean every man is powerful and every women a victim.\nJust a the existence of white privileged doesn\u2019t mean every white person is rich or has an easy life.\nIt just means they are part of a group that tends to be favoured in a certain society and it is easier to fall into those patterns or benefits in some ways from that.\nOf course you guys aren\u2019t powerful patriarchs or you wouldn\u2019t be reactionaries. You are likely disempowered and any corrections to greater societal norms feel like they are improving other peoples lives to the detriment of your own. If they is a chick I want to date it feels more difficult if she has as much money as me or more. You guys are not without your points. But for the most point your concerns, like boys getting left behind in school, are part of feminism. You just tend to point to the more extreme crazy or dumb and fringe examples to make it easier to hate them. I also dislike cringe people fringe weirdos with extreme and niche political ideas that would never work on broad scale.\n\n\nIt is tough to listen to other peoples bullshit when you are overworked and under appreciated.\nBut it seems like these likely aren\u2019t the issues that are making your life hard.

It asserts that women are the oppressed or the victims and never the collaborators in the 'bad' things that men do. \n\nIt entails a double standard around sexuality where women's sexual self-expression is seen as necessary and even desirable, but men's is seen as dangerous or even disgusting. \n\n**Womanism is by no means confined to a tiny, politically motivated bunch of man-hating feminists, but is a regular feature of mainstream culture.** \n\n>And the extreme kind seems to be the only kind you refer to as feminism.\n\nThere are hundreds of different kinds of feminism. But ALL feminists talk about feminism, and believe in feminism.  That makes them all feminists.\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nSo what you're saying is that you, a commenter using a username on an internet forum are the true feminist, and the feminists actually responsible for changing the laws, writing the academic theory, teaching the courses, influencing the public policies, and the massive, well-funded feminist organizations with thousands and thousands of members all of whom call themselves feminists... they are not \"real feminists\".\n\nThat's not just \"no true Scotsman\". That's delusional self deception.\n\nListen, if you want to call yourself a feminist, I don't care. I've been investigating feminism for more than 9 years now, and people like you used to piss me off, because to my mind all you were doing was providing cover and ballast for the powerful political and academic feminists you claim are just jerks. And believe me, they ARE jerks. If you knew half of what I know about the things they've done under the banner of feminism, maybe you'd stop calling yourself one.\n\nBut I want you to know. You don't matter. You're not the director of the Feminist Majority Foundation and editor of Ms. Magazine, Katherine Spillar, who said of domestic violence: \"Well, that's just a clean-up word for wife-beating,\" and went on to add that regarding male victims of dating violence, \"we know it's not girls beating up boys, it's boys beating up girls.\"\n\nYou're not Jan Reimer, former mayor of Edmonton and long-time head of Alberta's Network of Women's Shelters, who just a few years ago refused to appear on a TV program discussing male victims of domestic violence, because for her to even show up and discuss it would lend legitimacy to the idea that they exist.\n\nYou're not Mary P Koss, who describes male victims of female rapists in her academic papers as being not rape victims because they were \"ambivalent about their sexual desires\" (if you don't know what that means, it's that they actually wanted it), and then went on to define them out of the definition of rape in the CDC's research because it's inappropriate to consider what happened to them rape.\n\nYou're not the National Organization for Women, and its associated legal foundations, who lobbied to replace the gender neutral federal Family Violence Prevention and Services Act of 1984 with the obscenely gendered Violence Against Women Act of 1994. The passing of that law cut male victims out of support services and legal assistance in more than 60 passages, just because they were male.\n\nYou're not the Florida chapter of the NOW, who successfully lobbied to have Governor Rick Scott veto not one, but two alimony reform bills in the last ten years, bills that had passed both houses with overwhelming bipartisan support, and were supported by more than 70% of the electorate.\n\nYou're not the feminist group in Maryland who convinced every female member of the House on both sides of the aisle to walk off the floor when a shared parenting bill came up for a vote, meaning the quorum could not be met and the bill died then and there.\n\nYou're not the feminists in Canada agitating to remove sexual assault from the normal criminal courts, into quasi-criminal courts of equity where the burden of proof would be lowered, the defendant could be compelled to testify, discovery would go both ways, and defendants would not be entitled to a public defender.\n\nYou're not Professor Elizabeth Sheehy, who wrote a book advocating that women not only have the right to murder their husbands without fear of prosecution if they make a claim of abuse, but that they have the moral responsibility to murder their husbands.\n\nYou're not the feminist legal scholars and advocates who successfully changed rape laws such that a woman's history of making multiple false allegations of rape can be excluded from evidence at trial because it's \"part of her sexual history.\"\n\nYou're not the feminists who splattered the media with the false claim that putting your penis in a passed-out woman's mouth is \"not a crime\" in Oklahoma, because the prosecutor was incompetent and charged the defendant under an inappropriate statute (forcible sodomy) and the higher court refused to expand the definition of that statute beyond its intended scope when there was already a perfectly good one (sexual battery) already there. You're not the idiot feminists lying to the public and potentially putting women in Oklahoma at risk by telling potential offenders there's a \"legal\" way to rape them.\n\nAnd you're none of the hundreds or thousands of feminist scholars, writers, thinkers, researchers, teachers and philosophers who constructed and propagate the body of bunkum theories upon which all of these atrocities are based.\n\nYou're the true feminist. Some random person on the internet.\n\nKaren Straughan\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n*I can honestly sorry to say I've never met any feminist I could 'respect\u2019.

They're not 'wrong' when I disagree with them in the same way that I'm 'right' you disagree with me.\n2. I quite clearly qualified why this is the case, so that's not really relevant...\n\n>Given that European empires conquered half the globe and are very rich.\n\nThose aren't people, those are empires.  And 99.9999999999% of people on Earth aren't emperors.  And an emperor vastly exceeds the status of 'privilege'.\n\n>The stereotypes of whiteness or even just be light skinned tend to be very positive.\n\nThat's probably your best point... but it's such a superficial, intangible, unquantifiable, unlikely benefit that mouthing such a thing undermines your point.  'Ignorant people like me more' is a booby prize, not a privilege.  You're undermining the struggle the coloured people of the world have.\n\nAnd I don't know if you've looked out a window in the past 40 years, but this claim is dubious at best.  There are plenty of people who have a very poor view of the stereotypical white people, you rightly used the word 'tend', because it's not a universal, or even LIKELY outcome.\n\n>You passport will be more powerful and gain you access to more places.\n\n1. A broad majority of people don't travel.\n2. Those who do enjoy this benefit are the people who are already in the upper class, those of LITERAL privilege.\n3. It's a very, very, very silly point.\n4. People of colour live in European countries.  \n\n>You could be from a poor background and wear a suit and as long as your teeth are ok your accent isn\u2019t too much you could basically bend in with more affluent circles\n\nI'm not sure how to address such a blatant, obvious falsehood.  In fact much of the Western world, specifically the Anglosphere is of the most class impermeable cultures.  England is all but a caste system in everything but name.\n\n>your accent isn\u2019t too much\n\nIn other words: no one who isn't already privileged benefits from this statement.\n\n>Same with feminism each decade that passes there are less disadvantages to not being white or a man in western countries.\n\nNo, there are tangible benefits to being a man.  Almost every man is stronger than almost every woman.  That is a benefit. \n\nIf your best point had this level of extremity, that stereotypes of white people tend to be better viewed than coloured people, 95% of white people would enjoy a higher social status than 95 of coloured people.  This type of inequality doesn't exist under SLAVERY.\n\nComparing the advantages men enjoy to the advantages white people enjoy is an insult of unfathomable breadth to women.\n\n>Perhaps you don\u2019t feel any benefits because of other material conditions but that doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t any or never were.\n\nIf they're too small to be noticed they're too small to mention.  You're asking me to take this claim based on faith?  Son, this ain't no church.\n\n>This last couple sentences makes no sense at all. I am one pointing out that white privileged exists. You say it doesn\u2019t. Then you excuse me of saying black people don\u2019t have disadvantages.\n\nYou seriously can't understand the difference?  That's not a rhetorical question.\n\n>Those are two contradicting statements.\n\nThey're not.\n\n>Those are two contradicting statements. Short privilege? So if every short person was being punch in a society dominated by tall people.\n\nI'm sorry, but you're not a society.   In fact I doubt you're more than seven people.  Ten tops.\n\n>I\u2019m trying to understand your point.\n\nTypo.  I meant punch taller people.\n\n>Are men the short people in this metaphor?\n\nNo.\n\n>Do you feel that in recent decades that society has tried to fix certain imbalances and gone too far so now you feel you are part of an oppressed or marginalised class?\n\nDon't add a new subject, this already way into the weeds... and I think you might be confusing this conversation with another one.",

Empires they enriched themselves at the expense of of others?  Yes of course you aren't an emperor you fucken brainlet.\nBut you live in a country that is much richer and more powerful. You dollars what little you have buy more.\nYour country has hundreds of years of inferstructure to make it easier to make more money. You can travel to another country or buy products from another country and get more for less and gain a trade advance that compounds over time. Being on the bottom of that system is still of that system is still better than being in like a 100 countries. Countries were the people strangely aren't white and didn't have vast trade empires.\n\nAfrica for example has fuck all inferstructure.\nEuropeans came in and build train lines which are usually   very useful and benefit common folk. But these trainlines were just between mines and ports to extract wealth out of these nations.\nYes people aren't nations. But you would understand that a rich person has an advantage over a poor person right?\nWell a rich nation has advantages over poor ones.\nEven if some of the people in the rich nation are poor.\n\nI assume you are in America. America is overdue for change. The gap between rich and poor is spreading and most people arent getting what they need and everyone is getting more and more aggitated. The factions think different causes and people are to blame.\nBut if you are on the bottom and have no money for travel etc. A labour, union movement system would be beneficial assuming you can work. Healthcare, debt relief. Systems to limit the predatory businesses and corporations that exploit the poor and profit off keeping workers in worse conditions.\n\nMen have valid issues and concerns but fighting for unity and better class conditions would likely be more beneficial than a war of the sexes. Right Wing politics is easier to stomach because they give you easy targets to hate and blame for complex issues. The left has some better solutions imo. But in the social online aspects that are too holier than though alienate too many people and shame them.\n\nSorry you wrote so much and I addressed so little of it.\nI am stuck at home in covid iso this week and one day I may be very into online debating and the next I have to get on and use that time more wisely.",

He's confusing power structure with patriarchy.  He's describing a patriarchal monarchy, not understanding that patriarchal oligarchies, and republics have existed and do exist.\n\ne.g: the papacy and Switzerland respectfully.  Women got the right to vote in Switzerland well after world war two, despite it being one of the oldest republics in Europe.\n\nSecond: you're describing patriliny; it's only patriarchy when the control of a society is transferred that way... although having written that just now I think it's a little knit-picky, and since you've been so reasonable elsewhere I ought to cut you some slack, so nevermind.",

Why is that?\n\n- The Patriarchy:\n\nThe bogeyman that feminists blame for women's problems or under-achievements because their big-girl pants apparently don't fit.\n\n- The Patriarchy:\n\nA term used by feminists, to blame men for all their problems.\n\nJane: \"Why have we run out of bread?\" \n\nGill: \"Because of the patriarchy.\"\n\n- The Patriarchy:\n\nNo theory is more fundamental to academic feminism than the theory of the patriarchy.  Quite simply - and perhaps too simply - patriarchy is the feminist theory that there is a regime of institutionalised male control over women.\n\n\n- The Patriarchy:\n\nIn all, the thick academic prose of feminist scholars confers gravitas to what otherwise could resemble political propaganda. \u201cThe patriarchy is the root cause of everything! Fight it now!\u201d\u2026 if only the word patriarchy was replaced with capitalism, it\u2019d be similar to communist propaganda.\n\n- The Patriarchy and genders are to feminism what capital and social classes are to marxism.\n\n- The Patriarchy: \n\nHate speech, against men.\n\n\n- There is no organized patriarchy of men oppressing women. \n\n- There is no patriarchy wanting to keep you down because of your gender. \n\n- Men at the top don't form some sort of secret cabal meant to keep you from succeeding. Society does not operate like that.\n\nIf you say there is a patriarchy, then women are just as much to blame for it's existence, as they make up slightly more than 50% of the societies they live in. \n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n*Feminism is an ideology that claims to empower women by continually telling them how weak and vulnerable they are.*",

Nor do we see the oppressed class being given better education, we see that with the \u201cpatriarchy\u201d. The oppressed class has never been given more legal rights, women are.\n\nThis only leads to one conclusion, the oppressor class of the patriarchy can not exist.",

What makes Marxism marxism is that they believe that economic class is the only factor in society. That's all there is to it, if you replace class conflict with sex conflict it's something else...\n\nAlso as an extended metaphor that makes no sense bc the source of the class conflict is a need to suppress the lower class because the lower class does all the work in society... which like lol women don't do half of the work, let alone all of it. Women do negative work if you're talking monetarily. So sex marxists would want to enslave women. \n\n#siezethememesofreproduction",
