      "text": "This is a super complex subject, and research continues. The comment was made that y'all were curious what feminists could even try to use to argue against this. I'm not going to argue *against* it, but rather dog into some of the factors. I'm responding in good faith that at least some of you are interested in an actual conversation on the topic, and not just enjoying an echo chamber - if the latter, I'll probably just see myself out.\n\nFor context, I identify as a feminist despite having issues with some of the movement myself. I'm avoiding throwing the baby out with the bathwater, to use an old cliche. I am also a research psychologist with degrees in psychology and sociology, with specializations in statistics. This kind of stuff is my jam.\n\nFrom everything that I've seen in research on this subject, the truth is somewhere in the middle between the two perspectives (different choices/harder work vs. blatant sexism).\n\nIf you look on the USA bureau of labor statistics site you can see the breakdown of gender pay gap by field - it's very much different depending on what field you're talking about. Some fields women even make more. However, for a majority of fields men do make more on average. (What i would love to be able to do is run all the numbers on it controlling for hours worked, position seniority, etc. but sadly that's not possible with the way they have it set up). Even controlling for only full time labor, the gap exists.\n\nNow, if you look to the us census data for statistics (apologies, all my stats are USA based as that's where I'm from) you'll find that when comparing full time employed men and women, men on average spend more hours working per week than women, whereas women spend more time doing household tasks then men. Naturally, if an employer is looking for dedication this will hold weight, and if this is an hourly wage situation it's definitely going to impact the numbers.\n\nOk, let's dig a little deeper. So women are a bit more preoccupied at home while men do more at work (on average). Why is this?\n\nI forget what university (if anyone wants any citations on these i can look them up, just been a minute since i read them) did a longitudinal study on married couples following graduation. They asked them \"whose career will be given priority? His? Hers? Or equal?\" And then followed up later to find out how it actually played out. A majority of men said that their own career would be most important, whereas the women tended to push for a more equal partnership (the results vary by generation). In the follow up, men's careers had taken priority more often, and the women were not always happy about being relegated to staying home.\n\nAnother factor often cited in the wage gap is that men often hold higher positions as women choose to prioritize flexibility for childrearing over career advancement. This is absolutely true in many cases! However, some women are denied advancements under the expectation that they will make that choice. You can see this culturally played out in interviews of celebrities - it's always the women who are asked \"how do you balance your career with your family\". Everyone assumes it's the mother doing the balancing act. Nobody asks the fathers that.\n\nThis actually highlights the negative impact on men as well in the flipside of this societal assumption that women will be the primary caretakers - men find much more difficulty gaining flexibility needed to be fathers. Less or no paternal leave, less understanding and accommodation in everything from time off to facilities. American society is not built for involved fathers and it sucks.\n\nOne final factor I want to discuss in all of this: aggression.\n\nWomen are much less likely to ask for a raise. They are more likely to view it as something that is granted as a reward for good work, while men are more likely to pursue it.\n\nTied to this, though, is the fact that women who ask for raises are viewed more negatively than men who do and are less likely to be given it. A study was done with participants reading through a raise request and deciding whether it was warranted. Half read one signed with a female name, half with a male name despite being otherwise identical. The male request was more likely to be approved for a raise than the female's whose request was cited as \"pushy\", but his was seen as \"showing initiative\".\n\nTl;dr: women do sometimes make different choices leading to lower pay, and sometimes different choices are made for them. Sometimes companies pay more to men simply because men asked for it, sometimes they do because they see assertive women differently from assertive men.",
