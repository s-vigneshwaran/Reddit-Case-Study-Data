A seven-month investigation by the Thurston County Sheriff\u2019s Office concluded that Reinoehl had most likely initiated an exchange of gunfire with officers before he was killed.\n\n> A review by the New York Times found that the local investigators discounted key pieces of evidence that contradicted the notion that Reinoehl fired his weapon; for example, Reinoehl had a full magazine in the gun found on him. Officer reports, released after the initial summary of the investigation, also reveal that none of the officers describe Reinoehl pointing or firing a weapon at officers before he was shot and killed. Several officers did report Reinoehl reaching for his waist before the police opened fire. Witnesses stated that officers opened fire without warning. President Donald Trump commended the U.S. Marshals for shooting Reinoehl and described his death as \"retribution\".",
