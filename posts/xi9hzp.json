Essentially what it comes down to is that many topics can be expressed mathematically if you can perform the calculations quickly enough. \n\nWord embeddings can quantify meaning for words in ways that seem like something a child would make up but that actually work. With Google's word2vec, you can do things like encode the words Rome, Italy, and France. If you then take the encodings for Rome and subtract the encodings for Italy and then add the encodings for France, you will get the encodings for Paris. The \"difference\" between Italy and Rome and between France and Paris are equal and are approximately equal to capital in this model. \n\nWhat's happening in ML is that were getting to the point where our models can quantify concepts that we think of as being impossible to quantify. The models aren't \"intelligent\", they're just detailed and accurate.",
