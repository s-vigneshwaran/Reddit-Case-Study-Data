They initially got away with being Apple Computers as long as they didn't do any music. \n\nWhen it comes to trademarks it's not about how common the word is, it's about how much it will confuse consumers and how ingrained the original's name is. Apple the computer company and Apple the music company did different things (at least until iTunes which resparked the dispute). \n\nWhile there exist several companies with the word Meta in them, fairly few of them are in the big data social media space. So Meta the Facebook company is unlikely to get conflated with Meta the metalworking company or anything similar. \n\nGetting away with that argument gets harder and harder the rarer the word is, and meta is certainly not a common word. But at least it represents what Facebook deals with, metadata. Unlike the Meta Company which appears to have the exclusive raison  d'\u00eatre of being named the same as Meta.",

For common words like this that are trademarked, it's limited to the business that the company that owns it is involved in. For example, someone else trying to use the name that does something involved with social media would be in violation. It can be somewhat broad occasionally too, so a company involved at all with the internet or even computer technology may get crushed if the other side has a lot more cash on hand. However, if someone wants to start a company with meta in the name and they deal with livestock feed production then they are not violating the Facebook one. Facebook could still be a dick and bog them down with legal challenges that they can't afford to respond to, but in general they'd be left alone",

So you contact them when you find that the domain name you want has been registered by them (and if you want it that much you're prepared to over the odds for it rather than register a slightly different name). \n\nThey must have thought they had hit gold when they realised Facebook wanted one of their domain names.\n\nI despise Facebook as much as anyone but it seems to me that they were perfectly in their rights to not buy a domain name from someone if the price was too high (and just choose a slightly different domain name).\n\nFurthermore, as I understand it, you can setup a company with the same name as another just as long as you're not in the same line of business as them (and don't copy their logo or anything like that). So, unless Facebook's Meta company is buying domain names and selling them then it doesn't sound like they're treading on Meta Company's toes at all. It just sounds like Meta Company are salty they missed out on a potentially very lucrative sale by asking for too much.",

Decided it wasn't worth participating in the scam.\n\nNow the URL is owned by \"uniregistry\" ([who conveniently is owned by GoDaddy now](https://uniregistry.com/blog/post/better-together)), who claim that they have a premium domain and allow you to contact the owner to try and buy it from them. Except they stated you needed a **SIX FIGURE** starting offer to open up instructions. Who the fuck would ever pay six figures for a generic named domain... Like, if you had `apple.com` I might understand... but it's just my surname!

When I went to baseball games as a kid, and even as recently as the past decade, we'd buy our tickets from scalpers who were offering discounted tickets, same day, without having to do anything more than meet them as we walked to the stadium. They were providing a useful service of transferring tickets from people who didn't need them (e.g., season ticket holders who don't attend every game) to people who needed them, and it worked out better for everyone.\n\nBut automated bots or other bulk purchases with intent to resell, which is what is meant by \"scalpers\" more often today, don't seek to solve those sorts of problems, but to profit off creating problems.",

They do not need to prove the validity in their trademark in the letter, but to the USPTO; [which they did in 2016](https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=87027182&caseType=SERIAL_NO&searchType=statusSearch). If you follow the link, you'll see what services they provide.\n\nI do agree that abandonment is a way of losing a mark. Abandonment by non-use, however, is defeated by a demonstration of intent to resume use, like, you know, by making a public statement about your company ready to launch new products or services.\n\nI will also agree that the overlap is necessary to determine infringement. Given the way that Zuckerberg's lawyers have written the trademarks for Meta, the classes covered, and the goods and services discussed mentioned, they clearly want the widest protections available.",

What software, indeed. Though their product may be exclusively software, or partially software... it also might _not_ be software. Because no one actually mentioned software...

There are other reasons for refusing to sell.\n\nAlso, five figures (tens of thousands) is nowhere near enough to pay for a company name. Especially when your buyer is Facebook, or anonymous. No one should ever take this low of an offer, that amount of cash will not make much difference - it won't even hire you an additional full time minimum wage employee (about $35k to hire a full time min wage employee, or more).\n\nLet us be real about this. And consistent. And objective. Your assertions appear to me more slander and libel, than opinion or fact.\n\nAnd for the record. I _don't even use FB_, I am so against it. \n\nF*ck FB.",

That job that offers you 1.5x pay in another town... may increase your cost of living by 2x... for a net decrease.\n\n>A salary of $50,000 in Portland, Oregon could decrease to $25,406 in Harvey, North Dakota\u00a0(assumptions include Homeowner, no Child Care, and Taxes are not considered.\n\n- Overall, Harvey, North Dakota is 45.8% cheaper than Portland, Oregon\n- Median Home Cost is the biggest factor in the cost of living difference.\n- Median Home Cost is 81% cheaper in Harvey.\n\n\nhttps://www.bestplaces.net/cost-of-living/portland-or/harvey-nd/50000",

Things you don't buy off of Amazon.\n\nSecond, try comparing income/sales tax rates - the latter of which _does_ apply to amazon purchases.\n\nThird, try comparing the cost of food at a local restaurant.\n\nTheoretical = concerned with or involving the theory of a subject or area of study rather than its practical application.\n\nAntonyms? Practical. Applied.\n\nCost of living comparisons are an _applied science_, and therefore the literal opposite of theoretical..\n\nOregon may be nicer to live in, I certainly like it. But we have no one to praise/blame other than state representatives. Not each other.\n\nAs for real world economics not always going as theorized, I can't really argue that. But I will say, again, cost of living comparisons are not theory. It analyzes data sets. It is not a proposed solution which may or may not work.\n\nThat's analagous to saying \"Students performing better in classes at one school vs the other is just theoretical\". Wrong. It is an empirical analysis which operates on a known data set. Both schools have grades for all children, these do not change as we measure them. Theoretical would be more analagous to prediciting the grades of next year's students, based on a testable hypothesis. Very different than analyzing previous data.\n\nPortland costs more, that is that. It may not scale with minimum wages and costs of living in other states. But that does not change the fact that loving in New York is more expensive than living in Albuquerque.\n\nThe most simple and easy way to prove this to yourself, is to look at the cost to rent an _equivalent_ room in either location.\n\nSingle bed, single bath, apartment in Portland is 1.5k to 3k per month.\n\nThe same in Fargo, ND is 500 to 1.5k.\n\nNeed I say more? Please ask friends, family, coworkers, etc about cost of living and minimum wage differences.\n\nI am telling you. Your perception on this is _wrong_.",

Company would not come without domain. You brought up the topic of 'having a website'. In this context, it is not considered when litigating IP (trademark).\n\n>doesn\u2019t matter\n\nYou brought it up, now it doesn't matter?\n\n>It says it in this letter, you fucking clown, but you just jumped right into, \u201cfacebook bad end of story\u201d \n\nFirst off, let me say I am an _engineer_. Clown work is only my side hobby. Second, it did _not_ say anything about software in the letter. You may want to re-read it. I corrected you, and now you have tried to incorrect me, all while insulting my hobbies.\n\nAnd I only asserted Facebook made software, here. I didn't realize that was _bad_. I must be a _bad_ engineer...\n\n>You think Facebook burned up thousands of dollars in lawyers instead of just paying this dude for the domain, especially given the release of their platform? \n\nNOT domain. You are wrong, _again_! (Intentionally?)\n\nRelease of their platform? What do you mean? Please elaborate, seems uninformed.\n\nAnd do I tuink facebook burned thousands on lawyers? Hell yes. I know their engineering managers make 400k+ annual. Thousands is chump change to them.\n\nAnd remember, _Meta refused to sell_. Facebook _couldn't_ pay for the name, Meta, for their company (not a domain). So yeah, is it reasonable one of the probably top 5 most loaded companies in the US threw chump change at lawyers to try every option available to them?\n\n>They\u2019re negotiations, what? \n\nYes, when you offer to buy something, and you haggle over the price, and/or willingness to sell - it is called _negotiating_. You don't walk into Apple HQ, throw a $100 bill on the ground and say, \"_I'm_ Apple now, bitches!\"...\n\n>They didn\u2019t sign shit asshole, there hasn\u2019t been any deal signed. If they signed a NDR, you think this letter on their website \u201cmeta.company\u201d that is still not sold, so no NDR. \n\nFundamental misunderstanding persists. When you enter business negotiations, especially regarding a rebranding not yet made public, especially for very large and publicly owned companies, you sign NDAs.\n\nWhen Facebook's lawyers met with Meta owners, before anything was said, an NDA was signed. Standard in most all business transactions, and even just being interviewed... as I had an interview with FB at one point, and had to sign an NDA to even hear about the job deacription. Happened prior to discussing _anything_.\n\nYou are so confident they didn't sign a _non-disclosure agreement_ because you haven't heard about it in public? You may want to rethink your logic.\n\n>Sure. \n\nGlad we agree.\n\n>We don\u2019t know the offer. I\u2019m certain that Facebook has offered a more than fair offer. It\u2019s not even a top tier domain.\n\nI agree, Facebook was probably quite lucrative. And though the offer may be _more than fair_, Meta is under no obligation to accept their offer, ethical or otherwise.\n\nI will again state, offering someone an absurd amount of money, is not justification to take their property when they refuse your offer.\n\nStop mentioning domain. This appears to be a diberate effort to mischaracterize the issue. A _talking point_ some might say...\n\nNext time you correct, or edit your comments - I encourage you to reply in-line.",

From my single sentence closer? Didn't you post the same at the end of your original comment?\n\nWhat are you even talking about? Software is not even a part of this conversation, or shouldn't be. Meta has made no statement regarding 'software'. Whether or not a company _has software_ doesn't have any bearing on copyright/trademark infrigement. The only 'software' that would matter in these cases, would be duplicated or fraudulently branded software.\n\nI would like you to justify 'There was no company'.

End of story. This letter is what we are discussing. My point was this letter did not say software, it said product. Your rebuttal is that elsewhere software was losted alongside hardware.

It's irrefutable fact.\n\nFor instance, in this context, knowing facebook was about to make a big announcement (due to negotiations) - insider trading could occur. For this reason, to even hear the offer, you will have to sign certain terms.\n\nI may point out, you havent provided proof to the contrary, either. So youre effectively holding a double standard, and requiring proof of an NDA, which neither one of us would have access to, in order to prove my assertion.\n\nThis isn't how empiricism, or litigation, works in practice. This is a common fallacy argument intended to convolute a simple assertion with 'what ifs' and 'untestable accusations'.\n\nRegardless, it is industry standard. NDAs are used all the time. As mentioned in my previous comments, FB requires job applicants to sign an NDA before providing job details, at least for some engineering positions.\n\nWhen negotiating sales of public companies, and others, NDAs are commonplace. You said you were unable to find any?\n\n1 second of googling 'are NDAs common in company sales' and the top answer demonstrates you didnt even try. Anyone who tried a single google search would see you are wrong. Here's the proof.\n\n>An NDA may also be referred to as a confidentiality agreement.\u00a0Non-disclosure agreements are common for businesses entering into negotiations with other businesses.\n\n- Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) Definition\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nda.asp\n\n>The offer amount obviously matters to someone selling something. Again, Metacompany specifically says the offer was too low.\n\nYou are cherry picking facts. They said the offer was low AND they refused to sell unless they had identity and intent.\nYou are right. The selling amount matters to someone selling something. And to someone buying something. But just because I offer you a million bucks for your $100 annual profit company, does not mean _you must accept it_. Stop justifying Facebook stealing another company's brand, by asserting they must have offered more than enough, especially without knowing that amount.\n\nAlso, brand name IS part of trademark.\n\nI suggest you read all of the below, to better understand your mistakes.\n\n- legalzoom.com\nhttps://www.legalzoom.com/articles/should-i-trademark-my-business-name",

The letter doesn't mention Zuckerberg, but the title of the article mentions him. Was that forbidden? Or, like all normal discussions, are allowed to refer to publicly accessible information about the terms under discussion?\n\n> For instance, in this context, knowing facebook was about to make a big announcement (due to negotiations) - insider trading could occur. \n\nWhat insider and what trading? \n\n> knowing facebook was about to make a big announcement (due to negotiations) - insider trading could occur\n\nBut the letter says the lawyers didn't say who the negotiation was on behalf of. Either Metacompany knows who is trying to buy their domain or they don't (\"we insisted on knowing the client and intent, which they did not want to disclose\"). What is the hypothetical NDA they're signing that - prevents them from saying the offer size, but doesn't tell them the client, allows them to disparage the client and publicly discuss the negotiation? That NDA seems very unusual!\n\n> I may point out, you havent provided proof to the contrary, either. So youre effectively holding a double standard, and requiring proof of an NDA, which neither one of us would have access to, in order to prove my assertion.\n\nNo, I'm saying that you should prove that an NDA (with characteristics that match this situation) is common for *negotiating the terms of a trademark and/or domain name sale*. Literally any example of this ever happening would be informative. That could be facebook buying some other companies domain, or a 3rd company buying a 4th company's domain. I can't find evidence NDAs like this happen, because they seem totally unnecessary. An NDA for a *specific company* buying a domain makes sense to prevent that company having a reputation for paying a ton of money for domains ([e.g.](https://onlinedomain.com/2019/06/27/domain-name-news/and-this-is-why-you-get-an-nda/), but if you're approaching via lawyers to hide the buyer what's the point of the NDA? It's already common knowledge that people sometimes buy domains for a lot of money.\n\n> When negotiating sales of public companies, and others, NDAs are commonplace.\n\nI could have been more explicit here, but I mean sales of an *unused trademark / domain name*. That's almost entirely dissimilar from \"sales of a public company\". Obviously NDAs as a thing are used and are standard in certain types of transactions, I'm saying that I do not believe they are common (let alone with the necessary terms) as a *precursor for entering negotiations to buy a domain name through a lawyer intermediary*.\n\n> > >  What does the offer amount matter, anyway?\n> >\n> > Metacompany specifically says the offer was too low.\n> >\n>\n> You are cherry picking facts.\n>\n\nCome on. The answer to a question isn't \"cherry picking\".\n\n> just because I offer you a million bucks for your $100 annual profit company, does not mean you must accept it. \n\nYes, obviously. I've never disputed this.\n\n> by asserting they must have offered more than enough, especially without knowing that amount.\n\nI have not done this. You're thinking of someone else?\n\nThe claims I'm making are pretty narrow - I don't think it's likely that an NDA is binding metacompany from saying how much they were offered, I think that metacompany & Facebook are both being sharp negotiators and Metacompany is trying to put pressure on Facebook to get more money by going after them publicly. That's fine, they're allowed to do that, I'm sure Facebook offered them a lot less money than Facebook could afford and metacompany is trying to get a higher fraction of the surplus value than Facebook wants to offer them. Probably Facebook offered them some sizable but not totally ludicrous amount of money (say, 5k-50k) and if metacompany says how much people will go \"wow, that's a lot of money, I wish I had that much money\" and feel less sympathy, hurting their PR play. It might even be true they have a real product and Facebook didn't offer enough money, it's genuinely possible they have some product line that would cost $100k to update names & trademarks on and Facebook thinks the name is only worth 90k so no deal will happen. If that's the case it makes sense not to publicize the offer number, because people would probably find it difficult to believe.",

They own rights to the METACOMPANY trademark, which itself was permitted to register over a senior mark, META (which Facebook has acquired), presumably because the USPTO did not believe there was a likelihood of confusion between them. All this happened before Facebook got involved.\n\nIf Facebook's acquisition of META was more than just a naked license\u2014that is, if Facebook actually acquired the goodwill of the company with the mark itself\u2014then Facebook is the senior user, and MetaCompany will be forced to change their name and receive nothing. If Facebook acquired the name without the goodwill of the company, then Facebook doesn't have rights as a senior user. I'm guessing they don't really care much about the meta.company domain name.",

I don\u2019t fully understand how domains work so I won\u2019t debate too much further because I\u2019m sure there are technical implications to letting people completely own a domain name outright, but I believe very strongly that you should be able to temporarily own domain names while you are using it and that should come with rights as if it were your own intellectual property. It\u2019s like a street address in a virtual world. If I forget to water my lawn, it shouldn\u2019t suddenly disappear, but I will have to deal with the consequences of low/no upkeep. In the same way, if you don\u2019t keep up your domain name, it doesn\u2019t get hosted, stay secure etc, but allowing someone else to immediately take it from you is not what I imagine to be fair practice.",

Trademarks are for protecting identification for a service (slogans, names, icons, etc). \n\n\nIn this case, they have that specific web page copyrighted which means the owner is their LLC named \"Meta\" and all the rights to that website goes to them. It's like a book. Books have the \"copyright \u00a9  [publisher] [year]\" which means the named publishing company owns the rights to that book and that prevents people from copying the book and selling it as their own or using it without providing credit. \n\nIf they were to trademark their LLC title, that'd be different and no one else could use the name... But they didn't. They trademarked \"Meta Company\" instead. Having a company name doesn't automatically mean it's trademarked since LLCs are only protected in the state in which they reside. If another company came along with the same name and it was *based* in the same state their LLC is then they could claim legal rights, but they would need to trademark it to get protections throughout the country.",

Also once these type of people realize they can do this to a company just because people disagree with their business practices, who is to stop them from doing it to the little guy (us as an example) because they feel empowered and big headed. We should never encourage this type of behavior because that makes us no better, maybe even worse, than the people trying to pull this off.

It's his domain to do with as he pleases, and it's pretty easy to prove he didn't scoop it out from under facebook, with the timeline alone.\n\nDomain squatting isn't as simple as \"you aren't using it yet\". You have to literally prove that they registered it for no other reason than to sell it to someone. And that is pretty clearly not the case, even if they are exaggerating the situation because \"facebook bad, give moneys\"",

When accusing someone of cyberquatting, the plaintiff has the burden of proving bad faith on part of the registering party.\n\nAnd provided the current owner doesn't also own a multitude of other unused domains, and can show *any* reasonable history of intent to utilize the domain, it would be insane to think that a reasonable judge (again, outside of boomer-ass technophobes) would rule against the owner.\n\nCase in point: [https://nissan.com/](https://nissan.com/)\n\nSo again, facebook doesn't just get to take it because they are bigger, or because the owner isn't using it yet. They have to prove that he registered it in bad faith. And if he has any documentation of intent to use it for something, past, present or future, it pretty much shuts their claim down.\n\nBut I don't even know why we are arguing about this, because it is a publicity stunt, and facebook hasn't even taken them to court. :)",

The 10 acre lot next to yours is an oilfield company that wants to expand and wants your 10 acres (since you aren\u2019t doing anything with it at all) so they just lay claim to it then sue you for the property. How do you think that is going to turn out?\n\nMy opinion of the outcome here is that the expanding company will lose, unless they bribe government officials. \n\nBut by your logic here the company next door should have full legal rights to your property because they want it and you aren\u2019t using it.",

You just chose a name, put .com after it, and that's where your creativity lived. It was a different world and I got to be part of it, the internet, before it got chewed up in the capitalist maw.",

You can look up how well it does privacy online - it's well known to be one of the apps that respects privacy the most.\n* It's cross platform.  Works on Android and iPhone.\n* On Android it acts like iMessage if you allow it to handle your SMS/MMS too.  Basically it'll check to see if the person you're messaging is also on Signal.  If they are, it'll send it as an encrypted Signal message.  If they aren't it'll send it as normal SMS/MMS.  Unfortunately on iPhones it's a separate app.\n* There's a desktop app so you can message any other Signal people from your computer.  Unfortunately you can't SMS/MMS from your desktop though.  But it's also a great way to transfer stuff from phone to computer and vice versa.  There's a \"contact\" called Note to Self that you can use to transfer stuff from phone to computer.\n* They have sent/received/read receipts (you can turn off read receipts if you want)\n* There were a few service hiccups but aside from the very rare hiccup, it's been quite reliable.\n* It has groups\n* It has group video call\n* It can do voice calls too\n* It can do disappearing messages (which is great when you want to discuss more private matters or vent about someone and don't want it to bite you in the ass later.)\n* You can securely backup your messages",

They both kill animals for meat, but one does far more damage than the other. It's about siding with the least destructive provider. Participating in something keeps it alive which is why we see a lack of quality in a number of products and services. When a business realises it can exploit people for profit because those people don't recognise or care about the damage it causes, that business continues to build in such exploits. By all means do what you want, I'm just pointing out the difference between using one service over the other. Data collection is not the only problem with Facebook, and that should be clear as day by now.",

It depends on *everyone's* choices.\n\nI don't hold any loyalty to any specific messenger app. I use Signal if it's an option, but generally I use *whatever the person I'm trying to contact is on*. And this goes tenfold for group chats: if you're setting one up, you need everyone you want invited to have the app, and if you want to be added to one you need to have the app it exists in. WhatsApp is the usual default because everyone has it - that's why Facebook paid billions for it, nothing to do with the underlying technology.\n\nAvoiding messenger apps basically means avoiding messenging. Which is, of course, a choice you can make if you like, but don't act like it won't prevent that.",

This is why Facebook Messenger is often amazing, there's nothing they can do in the app when just trying to send me a message which will cost them. Even with the Messages app on iPhones you run the risk of sending an international SMS when you didn't want to due to a variety of factors.\n\n2020 was particularly painful with all of this because communication suddenly ramped up between all of us and having a method to easily include everyone and not risk international fees was important. Since they all had Facebook anyway, made sense we stuck with that instead of trying to teach old dogs new tricks when communication was the most vital thing we had.",

I say this as someone raised in Zimbabwe.\n\nIn addition to this, mobile network operators reinforce WA's advantage by offering discounted data rates specifically for WA traffic (sometimes even subsidized by WA). Since traditional data is expensive, people will buy WA data bundles. This makes other app alternatives significantly more expensive.\n\nCombine these 2 critical factors and what you get is a WA monopoly. The other \"alternatives\" have to significantly overcome that initial market share gap and hope (or lobby) that mobile network operators offer Signal/Telegram bundles to compete. But that's extremely difficult to do because the apps are free and perform basic functions: there's not much to differentiate apps and create competition for demand. There's no reason for people to ditch WhatsApp for Signal for example.\n\nThere is a nuanced explanation of why there are ZERO WhatsApp alternatives in most developing countries.",

Also, for Gen X it is the only way to keep contact with friends, close and abroad.\n\nFacebook is exactly as toxic as YOU ARE. That is the devil in disguise. It is well behaving if you NEVER click on a clickbait, nor get outraged and start a comment war. It is also as toxic as your friends are.. The way i solved it was to install Fluffbuster/FBPurity. It filter content based on your choices. I don't see any outrage inducing content. I don't see friends of friends. I don't see random posts from some random group or a news-site. I don't get sponsored or recommended content. My FB is usually quite calm and friendly. Even without that filter it stays clean because i have not engage in that kind of content for years. That is one crucial part, it is a hiding filter, not blocking filter. So, FB does try to send my back to my old ways of high blood pressure and constant rage, but i don't see those posts and can't react to them...\n\nSo, while FB is a mirror of ourselves, it is a very twisted image and there are solutions to curate it. Note, Facebook does not allow any mentions of that plugin. Not even in a PM... It absolutely is not illegal, you have the freedom to filter content as much as you like, it just is not \"facebook approved\".",

So, he registered  [Last Name].com for us to use...not that he ever did anything with it.\n\nWell, he didn't realize that there was a legitimate, small company with our last name on the other side of the country.  The owners, who also share the same last name, contacted my father about purchasing the domain.  Dad did some digging and found out it was a mom & pop company with three locations.  It was fairly well known in the region it was in, but we had never heard of it.  Dad sold them the domain for little more than he paid to register it.  \n\nWe ended up getting Christmas cards from that family for about fifteen years, until the owners died and the company was taken over by someone else.",

Over here in Czech Republic there is a charity called Meta, they provide educational aid to kids for whom Czech is not their first language. Without warning and in the middle of promoting their next campaign, facebook blocked their profile on which they had 5000 followers (which is good for a small chartiable organization in a country of just 10 million people) and which they have been using as their main communications channel since 2009. Facebook blocked them for impersonation, effectively for falsely using someone elses brand name, which is what Facebook is doing. The Czech Meta owns that name in Czech Republic, have been registered under that name for years. Worst thing is that all it would have taken was an email from Facebook asking nicely to change the page name from just Meta to Meta o.p.s. with o.p.s. meaning NGO in Czech, which is the full legal name of the organization and also the name of their Instagram page.",

In the 8 years it\u2019s been registered has had absolutely no web presence. Good for them and all, and fuck Facebook, but let\u2019s not get too upset over it. \n\n*\u201dDelayed our software release\u201d* give me a break. \n\n\u2014\n\nOkay so alternate theory here. \n\nI cannot figure out what \u201cmeta.company\u201d does. I\u2019m sure by absolutely no doubt that Facebook is doing what they do with help from the homies and suppressing search results. I have also tried DuckDuckGo with not much avail. \n\nSo, I suspect that this whole thing is just a ploy for this other company to make more money off the sale of their domain. \n\nThe fact that I\u2019m not seeing much from them, combined with the fact they have no other social media presence other than a picture of this message, is also showing that their sales process has very little to do with their online presence.  \n\nIf Facebook is as motivated to buy this domain as they\u2019re making it out to be, I\u2019m certain they have offered plenty more than enough money to cover any costs associated with the company relinquishing the name. Certainly at the point that law firms are now engaged on multiple contents. \n\nI hate Facebook, and hope to see their demise as much as anyone else, and haven\u2019t used any Facebook related companies for years now\u2026. \n\nBut I think the \u201cdestroyed our company and livelihoods\u201d is probably being a bit dramatic. Notice they didn\u2019t mention what the offer is? Because Facebook was probably like, \u201cokay, enough is enough, we\u2019re launching the platform, let\u2019s go\u2026 how\u2019s $120k sound?\u201d",

Katie Perry (designer) pointed out it is her real name and she has had it longer then Kathryn Hudson (singer real name). Katy Perry (designer) is now suing the singer who started a clothing line. \n\nSo you can try to trade mark something but does not mean some else that has been using longer can not make a case against you. \nhttps://www.energy941.com/katy-perry-is-sued-by-designer-katie-perry/",
