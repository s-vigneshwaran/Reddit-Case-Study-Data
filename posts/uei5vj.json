Well, look at that diagram he posted.\n\nWhat sorry excuses for human beings pass as outstandingly clever and insightful these days...\n\nEdit: Just to clarify as the comments showed there was some confusion about this: All of the above in this comment (except maybe the \"What sorry excuses\" paragraph if applied to Musk) should have come with /s. I thought that the /s was implied obviously enough, but I guess Twitter and the state of online discourse in general has conditioned us to treat over-the-top silly stuff as valid contributions to a discussion it's worth having. Musk himself is of course part of the reason for this.\nApologies for creating any confusion.",

Unions began to represent workers in collective bargaining agreements. You are correct that some, almost all, will also represent them in disciplinary actions up to and including dismissal but there are plenty that only deal with compensation and benefits. There are those that would fight for their workers and there are those that almost act as middle management for the corporation. Like I said different animals. My point is they exist on a spectrum in many different matters. Details are important, life is complicated.",

These are economic systems and not systems of government.\n\nIt is true that capitalism leans towards the right politically. More authority makes it easier to protect and control capital.\n\nAnd socialism thrives better with more left leaning politics because systems are more likely to be put in place that protect labor at the expense of capital.\n\nThat being said, there are plenty of examples of these socio-economic ideas being incorporated by governments on the opposite end of the spectrum.\n\nHitler was a totalitarian dictator who flirted with the idea of socially progressive economic systems\n\nWhile modern Europe has many thriving capitalist based economies while still providing protection to their labor force.\n\nTo summarize the political \"left\" is on the opposite side of the supposed law and order concept of government.  Socialism and capitalism are socio-economic theories not systems of government.\n\n And I'm not entirely sure what you mean by \"freedoms\" but I'll go ahead and give you the benefit of the doubt that you're not talking about what so many people who are confused about the left/right paradigm mean when they use the term \"freedom\".",

Many right wing people refuse to listen to any opinion that differs from theirs, as does the left. Went on a couple dates with an old coworker once and she immediately branded me as a liberal, but if you ask my mom she probably thinks I lean right, however if you see me talking with my dad I constantly argue with him because he's more right leaning than I am, and obviously older, so his perspective on things differ from mine, such as with stuff with work reform, housing, medical stuff, etc\n\nIf you disagree with anyone on the slightest topic you're automatically labeled a fascist/communist. Too many people are too far left/right and there is no more compromise, it's either right/wrong and winner/loser",

Liberalism is about maximizing freedoms (or limiting restrictions), and leftism is about collectivization of needs and societal benefits.\n\nThey\u2019re not conflicting concepts: a person who thinks she shouldn\u2019t be working 40 hours a week at slave wages so someone working behind a desk (or not working at all) can make money off her labor might also be upset by the desk jockey getting warnings for things that\u2019d get her fined, for instance.\n\nSo, to answer your question: unions are liberal whenever they try to give employees more rights in the workplace than they currently have\u2014meaning, for most of them, they\u2019ve been liberal since the start.\n\nAlso, unions have been leftist whenever they\u2019ve tried to have more of the company\u2019s profits distributed to the workers, through better benefits, better wages, or both.  In other words, they\u2019ve been leftist institutions from the start.",

I\u2019d say this is pretty accurate. A lot of Dems in Congress are from swing states and purple districts with moderate voters.

Not really sure why, I\u2019m sure there are a lot of reasons.\n\nIt also makes sense b/c as the GOP moves more and more to the right, in a 2-party system the moderate/center-right voters they leave behind only have one place to go: Democrats. Which keeps the moderate Dems at the same ideological spot to keep those voters. And since Dems can\u2019t maintain a majority without swing seats (thanks to republican gerrymandering over decades) it is a slow crawl for Dems moving to the left b/c they are basically herding cats while the GOP is herding sheep.\n\nUntil the Midwest & South stop being so conservative as a whole it will be a constant battle bringing the Dem party to the left.",

Is this comic supposed to be just from the point of view of the left? \n\nNo, the political center isn't a set point, it is defined by the beliefs of the country. If it were a math equation, you would take the average of everyone's beliefs and that would define the center. If the country moves farther left or right then the center moves, too.\n\nIf you look around the world the political center is different from country to country. Canada's center, for instance, is farther left than the US.\n\nThat doesn't just apply to the center either. Right, left and center are all relative terms, just like they are in any other part of life. Your computer is on your left or right based on which direction you are looking. \n\nSo, what he is saying is that the country has moved farther left, while he has stayed the same.\n\nI disagree with that. I think that both left and right have moved farther to the extremes, with online political echo chambers serving to polarize beliefs, but Elon seems to be indicating that the right has stayed the same while the left has gotten more extreme, but the suggestion that the right hasn't gotten more extreme just seems wrong to me.\n\nThat having been said, the terms right and left are largely bullshit anyways. So many policies get labeled \"left\" or \"right\" based on what party proposes them, with no real consistency in terms of what makes it one or the other. The same policy can often go from being a right wing one to a left wing one, or vice versa, just because a politician claims the policy as their own. It's just marketing.\n\nIt's nuts that people still define their politicial beliefs based on the side of French parliament that pro and anti-Revolution politicians sat on. People seem to have forgotten that a good idea is a good idea regardless of who proposes it.",

I challenge you or anyone to name one way the Democratic party and left leaning establishment has moved left economically.\n\nIn fact \"moving left socially\" is pretty superficial. It's nothing more than narrowly focused identity politics, turning each demographic into a clique with no intersectional interests with other groups. To put it in simpler terms: pandering.\n\nSo we have \"the left\" pandering to identity politics while \"the right\" tries to overthrow the government. There's really no comparison.\n\nMeanwhile, the actual left has maintained incredibly consistent beliefs and policy desires: reduction of the military budget, nationalized health care, strong unions, higher taxes on the rich and on generational wealth, money out of politics, free higher education, and strong safety nets. I have studied the history of my people (the left, I mean, I was literally born on a commune of college hippies back in 1970) and I know these policy desires have remained consistent since, oh, the early 1900s.\n\nSo what out of all that seems \"extreme\" to you? Or is it the faux left neo-liberal center right party known as the Democrats you have an actual problem with? Because hey, you're in good company with every other lefty if that is the case. We hold our noses and vote for people who say they are \"progressive\" but then turn around and vote for huge military budgets.

He went from outsider to almost winning leadership.\n\nIt's not like the Democrats do everything the left wants, but how much oxygen would issues like student debt forgiveness have gotten in the 90's? Obamacare would never have happened in Cold War times. How much oxygen would minimum tax rates for the rich have gotten?\n\nThe party may not have moved as far as you would like, but I guess you guys have been succeeding, because the policies of the party are pretty solidly moving left. Obviously, its a very big tent party, and you don't sound like you would identify as being a centrist, but the center of the democratic party has certainly moved its policies further left over the last couple of decades, from an economic perspective, too.",

Student Debt wasn't a problem in the 90s because we had not yet moved so far right, college was not yet considered primarily a money making endeavor. It was affordable and student debt, when it did become and issue, was still dischargeable in bankruptcy. There was a push to make college free, rather than just forgive debt! THAT was what was getting airtime back then.\n\nI'm 50. I remember what the real left looked like. I remember Carter, and even Clinton, who we thought of as very centrist at the time. I mean, there was a really huge push for nationalized health care in his term. Not that laughable Obamacare. Real single payer, and it almost passed. That's a huge reason the right hates Hillary, she made it her big project as First Lady.\n\nOther real leftist issues were also getting much more press. And we made huge amounts of progress in many areas, right up to the Bush II era. 9/11 really did change everything. Reagan started the rightward shift, Fox News accelerated it, and 9/11 put it into overdrive.\n\nIf your only example is student debt, sorry. That's a laughably bad example and you should really stop opining about politics you know nothing about. That's not a lefty idea. Like Obamacare, it was something the Republicans of the 90s came up with the stave off real lefty ideas like free college or nationalized health care.",

On the one hand, the center is shown as the left's view of what the center is, but doesn't actually represent what the left thinks of him or the right.\n\nOr I guess he COULD be saying that \"centrists\" have no fixed view, and will automatically position themselves between some guy on the right whose views never change, and the most extreme leftist.

When, really, the idea of the \"center\" is geometric here, so OF COURSE both endpoints get further from the center whenever the length of the line increases, regardless of who, if anyone, actually moved.\n\nFor the record, I do think that the comic represents something that can actually happen. When we talk about the political center, we are very rarely talking about an actual ideology. We are instead talking about whatever ground happens to lie roughly halfway between the two loudest camps. If someone's ideology is roughly at the center, and the loudest camps move, then of course they might find themselves no longer at the center, even if their ideology didn't change.\n\nOf course, I think that it is far more common for people to claim that this has happened to them (to safeguard them from the realization that their views have actually gotten shittier) than it is for it to actually happen to them as depicted here.",

I never feared change, but feared the chaos to which people without moral clarity would descend.  I stand by that principle today.  I was never a conservative, but a Classic Liberal whose most convenient label was conservative.  99% of the folks on both the left and the right are just waving banners without any real understanding of what their banner stands for,  swayed only by rhetoric, or by the loudest voices.

Still hate gays, still want to tell a woman what to do with her body, still want to give rich people more money. But the methods have certainly changed. They now craft laws that bypass your constitutional rights (see Texas and the bounty program) knowing the packed Supreme Court will not strike them down. They continue to push the voter fraud lie despite the lack of evidence of wide spread voter fraud. They continue to disenfranchise voters, primarily POC (again see Texas). Their efforts are still the same but it\u2019s been ramped up to 11, hence why people say the party has moved further to the right. The days of being a closet bigot are gone, it\u2019s a source of pride now.",

It's unrealistic to claim that overall, society HASN'T become more liberal. \n\nThere's a lot of democrats who also feel many on the left have abandoned them as they get more extreme. \n\nThere are extremists on both sides of politics. \n\nTwitter has OPENLY censored conservative accounts, whill allowing groups like ISIS to keep their accounts. Thats a fact, not an opinion. You can see. That inbalance is what people have been complaining about. \n\nBanning people who simply disagree with Jack's politics, should not be ok to anyone. Open discussion is a GOOD thing. Users still have the option to block people. \n\nReally not sure why people are trying to make such a big deal about this. There's still shareholders who have a say in Twitter. There's a lot of political fear mongering happening right now.",

I'M your parent now\". \n\nAre you going to pretend you've never heard of Lea Thomas??? Nobody cares that she's trans...NOBODY. What they care about is that she went through male puberty and has permanent physical body differences because of it. People (including most conservatives) will call her a woman all day long, but to LIE and pretend she doesn't have a male body advantage over all the women in swimming is just that...a LIE. \n\nEveryone knows lesbian and bi women are called turfs or transphobic for wanting to date only biological females. You are a straight up liar if you try to deny that. This is happening everywhere.\n\nAnd I'll bet you think conservatives are all white. THAT'S a lie. You probably believe all conservatives are straight and uptight. THAT'S a lie. \n\nI used to be a registered Democrat. Not anymore. Democrats have lost their fckn minds lately. Do you even know Obama and Biden were adamantly against gay marriage? Well guess who was out marching FOR gay marriage?

They haven\u2019t changed much on those issues which is annoying and I complain about to my senators/rep frequently.\n\nThose problems also exist in the GOP, except add on top of that a nation-wide push to decertify the 2020 election, releasing no platform on where they stand on issues and instead becoming \u201cthe party of trump\u201d, delegitimizing our political institutions under Trump, Qanon shenanigans, COVID denialism, white supremacy, CRT hysteria, etc. \nThe list goes on.\n\nSo yes, the DNC hasn\u2019t moved on it\u2019s internal problems of greed and ineptitude. But to equate the two as \u201cboth being bad\u201d let\u2019s the lunacy of the GOP in the last 10 years off the hook, in my opinion.",

The US Democrats are basically a Conservative party compared to their peers in any Western European country. And Elon is a well traveled, disingenuous attention whore who knows this. \n\nYour comments about gender seem to completely miss the concept of gender *identity*. Some people are born gay. Some men identify more or less as women, and some women identify more or less as men. This is a matter of biology, psychology, chemistry\u2014whatever. The fact that the only people railing against this idea are intellectual heavyweights like Joe Rogan should tell you something. \n\nFurthermore, no one on the left is exclusively maintaining alliances with conservative and authoritarian Islam. Quite the contrary\u2014both the Bush and Trump families are deeply intertwined *personally* with the Saudi royal family. Which is wildly hypocritical because, since 2001, the GOP at large has taken the position that Islam is bad\u2014full stop. They\u2019ve consistently vilified a quarter of the global population and admonished anyone else who doesn\u2019t renounce all of Islam and all Muslims as siding with terrorists. That position is *disgusting*. \n\nYour whole post makes you sound like a reasonable person with generally progressive views who\u2019s been suckered into a accepting bad faith mischaracterizations of milquetoast liberal social positions that favor letting people live their life the way they want when it has no material impact on anyone else. \n\nYour whole post reads like a Heritage Foundation case study on their ability to influence public social sentiment.",

And I believe people should be given the freedom not to work as society achieves the potential to realize it. For example, why should an artist be required to push out lower effort songs on a regular basis just to scrape by, rather than be able to take all the time they need to make exactly what they want to? It makes no sense to impose financial burdens on these people, it does not create a better culture.\n\nI think that America is being genuinely unintelligent when it holds in such high regard the ideal that everyone needs \"a job\", and that job creation is inherently good.\n\nI would bet at least 10-20% of jobs, maybe as high as 30-50%, either actively harm society or contribute nothing of important value. They're just people being put to work for no other reason than \"you need a job to eat, shelter and clothe yourself\".",

There are obvious mechanisms in the system meant to deter less committed people from applying to things they have a legal right to.\n\nI don't think it's true at all that UBI is too expensive to implement. I just think we still believe as a society that food and shelter is not a right. And neither is land a right.

To quote the source, \"Asperger's with a dash of autism\". You say that the word Asperger's, the literal name of the disorder, isn't used anymore and yet this quote does a pretty good job separating Asperger's from the rest of the spectrum. In fact every source I found on the supposed removal of Asperger's as a label states that the disorder was only removed from the DSM but it was not, however, demedicalized and is therefore still use by professionals. While we're on the topic I should point out to you that stating Asperger's is no longer relevant is an incredibly insensitive statement as the move to remove Asperger's from the DSM was an incredibly controversial decision that brought with it the potential to cause iatrogenic harm. So yeah, you're a POS. Also, it's weird that you mentioned you're a graduate, like OK. You completed your government mandated compulsory education just to play kissass to a corporate entity that only wanted your money without care of whether or not you got anything useful in return.

It's not just income tax though, there's corporate taxes, environmental and emissions taxes, property taxes, vehicle taxes. Oh and there's also sales tax which are calculated from the overall value of the product and not the added value, so more taxes for expensive products. As far as disabilities go your country isn't special. In 1990, congress passed into law the Americans with Disabilities act, a civil rights act that made it illegal to discriminate against those with disabilities. And this isn't the only thing in fact there are multiple social programs like social security, medicare, and medicaid designed to aid those with disabilities, all of which provide services for free as they are payed for by the government.",

The reason so many people, who you unjustifyingly call assholes, distinguish  Asperger's from the rest of spectrum is because it has to be otherwise harm can be done. I should know, I knew someone who was once given a medication in 2014 that instead of treating me resulted in an overdose. Fortunately he got to the hospital before things got serious. As it turn out the medication he was given was intended to treat conditions on the spectrum that had cognitive impediments, Asperger's is a high functioning neurotypical condition. In other words, by overlooking his previous diagnosis the doctor gave a medication that could have killed him. How do you justify that?",

Don\u2019t lie. \n\n>have sold out to lobbyists\u2026\n\nThis shows abject ignorance about what lobbying is. How would a politician \u201csell out to lobbyists?\u201d Please be detailed. What precisely do you mean by that? \n\n>I would assume the smartest candidates would also make the best decisions creating the greatest results. \n\nYou think the ideal political scenario involves a politician isolating themselves from the entire world, including their own constituents, writing their own laws, making their own votes without the interests of anyone else in mind just based on their own whims? That\u2019s not at all how it works, nor is it how the process should work. \n\nFor one thing, the vast majority of government important decisions are made at the administrative level. The people who run government departments are far and away much smarter and much more effective at making decisions than politicians. Your average department head would never get elected to public office, because, to half or more of the population, they are obnoxiously intelligent. I know it\u2019s hard to hear, but with few exceptions, appearing smart is a negative for the electorate in general. It is very difficult to be smart without coming off smart. Obama and Clinton did it very well. \n\n>we need to get money and corruption out of government. \n\nYes, private money finances campaigns, and I think that should change as well. But all this corruption talk is nonsense. People act like lobbyists show up to politicians\u2019 offices with bags of cash like in a bad movie. That is absolutely not how it works. Also, the people who scream about corruption are the same ones that want to institute term limits. There is no better way to guarantee corruption than term limits. The politicians who stay in office for their whole lives are the ones you want in office. The corrupt ones are the ones who turn around after a few years and take a multi-million dollar salary lobbying job. \n\n>the people on the take are also the ones making the laws. \n\nOn the take? Again, you seem to have a cartoonish theory of how policy-making works. Yeah, Blagojavic did that, and it was hilarious, and he immediately went to prison. The system largely works well, even though there are lots of improvements to be made. Republicans are the only party that is standing in the way of anti-corruption legislation.",

Legendary campaign spending. \n\nWhere are those industries now? How come their \u201cbribes\u201d didn\u2019t work? Where are the congresspeople they had \u201cin their pocket\u201d? \n\nIt is easy to see why health care is the way that it is. There is no conspiracy theory required. Here is the statistic that matters: \n\nhttps://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/survey-finds-over-9-10-people-say-doctors-are-most-trusted-professionals\n\nThink about that. This isn\u2019t just 9/10 people trust their doctors. This is 9/10 people trust doctors more than any other profession! So who gets to determine what kind of health care system we have? Doctors. And they sure as shit are not going to take a pay cut any time soon. \n\nAre there any other legislative conspiracy theories that you want me to put to rest? \n\n>the amount of money funneled into lobbying. \n\nBelieve it or not, lobbying does more good than bad in this country. My industry spends a lot lobbying to make sure that voter initiatives don\u2019t collapse the entire housing market. There are so many initiatives that sound good to voters but would have dire consequences for the state or the country, and the main job of lobbyists is to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen. \n\nIn the end, the people make the decisions. Can campaigns sway public opinion? Sure, but how are you going to get rid of that? It\u2019s not lobbying. It\u2019s not campaign donations. It\u2019s just an influence campaign, which is protected under the first amendment. \n\nAs you can see, I could talk about this for days, and I\u2019m more than happy to do so. There was this great episode of *This American Life* where a Republican election official made it a point to talk to anyone who wanted to talk to him about how the election was free and fair. He used facts and rationale to make his case, and he was met with nothing but baseless conspiracy theories and claims that he was getting paid by Democrats to do it. Sound familiar? If something doesn\u2019t go your way, *that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a huge conspiracy*. I\u2019m sorry, but I think people have been taking some crazy pills lately, because conspiracy seems to be the first thing on people\u2019s minds, and it\u2019s really dangerous for our country.",

Just look at antivaxxers.\n\nYou find someone who's afraid of needles and tell them that vaccines have 5G chips on them, they'll laugh it out. But if you tell them only that \"looks like this vaccine has some common side effects\" they may combine it with their fear and think \"I shouldn't take it yet\", then they look for more info on vaccines being bad. And they find one case of someone who had a severe allergic reaction and start thinking about it non-stop, ignoring that it was one person in billions. Then people start telling them that vaccines kill people and it doesn't seem so far fetched anymore.",

Do we harass people to suicide for not following the antiquated and frankly psychopathic teachings of a 3,000 year old book? Do we actively try to prevent people from loving who they love and not be ashamed? Do we try censor education and entertainment and spew fake news in order to keep an ancient, hateful world view alive? Do we try to indoctrinate children and vulnerable people, bringing out the worst in them, anger, hate, tribalism, instead of encouraging free thought, educated opinions, and actual meaningful debate? Do we throw insults and hate and bigotry in lieu of actual discourse? If you would answer yes, that would be news to me. I'm gonna need a fucking source, buddy. \n\nBy the way, I am not saying that all Republicans are like this and all Democrats aren't.

Let\u2019s not forget that Obama and Biden were both saying they didn\u2019t believe in gay marriage at times. https://time.com/3816952/obama-gay-lesbian-transgender-lgbt-rights/\n\nI\u2019m not saying that the Right hasn\u2019t moved some too, but please try to critically review of your own side as well.  Also, it\u2019s not like the RNC hasn\u2019t moved left on some issues.  Remember DOMA?  The RNC literally gave that up by 2016, and that\u2019s not just because of the Court.  The \u201clitmus test\u201d for Court appointments in Trump didn\u2019t even touch on gay marriage\u2014and it wasn\u2019t even discussed.  Hell, the RNC dropped scrapping entirely the ACA looking to just \u201creform\u201d it.",

The only way to own a billion dollars is to appropriate that wealth from others who labored to create it.",

                          "text": ">I can\u2019t imagine any/many low-wage workers\u2019 efforts exploited for it.\n\nThat's not really the point I'm making, though.\n\nThe people who helped create Rowling's wealth may have been well-paid. That doesn't mean nobody was exploited in order for her to own billions. Exploitation doesn't just mean \"poorly paid.\" Its a specific thing. Exploitation occurs where a worker produces more value than they are entitled to own, while someone else appropriates that \"surplus value\" which they did not work to produce. If you work to set up a campsite for yourself and then someone else comes and settles in it, then they've exploited your labor. If you work all day and pick $2,000 worth of cotton but someone else gets to own that full $2,000 while you get paid $0 for it, then your labor has been exploited. Same if they pay you $0.01 or $1 or $10 or $100 or even $1,000. The point is that someone else is making you do their work so that they can make money off of your work. That's exploitation. \n\nFor a relatively clear example of how Rowling was exploitative, we can look at the Harry Potter movies. She made millions off of these films that she didn't direct, act in, produce, etc. Other people put in the labor to produce a new value offering that was highly valuable, but she got to own a large share of the profits generated by *their work* despite not having done any of the work herself.\n\nNow you might say \"without her books, there would be no movies.\" And I would agree. But I would also counter that without the actors, cameramen, directors, producers, editors, etc, there would likewise be no movies. Rowling wouldn't be able to produce those movies on her own, and she certainly *didn't* produce them at all. The additional value generated from those movies is due to the work of those who labored to create them. Rowling was simply able to exploit the value generated by their movie-producing labor so that she could appropriate profits for herself.\n\nIt's also worth noting *how* that exploitation occurs. Rowling doesn't own the production company. Rather, she owns the Harry Potter story. Specifically, the story is a result of her labor, and the limited rights to that story are the commodity she produced. But when the production company wanted to \"buy her product\" to use kind of like a raw material in their film-making industry, Rowling didn't simply sell them those limited rights at some market value. Instead, she sold them her commodity *for a share of profit.*\n\nThe production company is only able to profit because they exploit their workers. I.e. the workers made a movie which netted more value than they were entitled to own, but despite the workers having made all that surplus value, the owners of the production company got to own it all. Then from this appropriated surplus value, a portion was shared with Rowling.\n\nFor comparison, a non-exploitative agreement would have gone something like this: Rowling writes a story that a production company wants to use for making a film. Rowling agrees to sell limited rights to the production company at a given market value. The production company pays for Rowling's commodity with money that was earned by the workers of this production company. The workers were the ones who democratically decided to use that money to purchase Rowling's commodity. They did so democratically because they collectively own this surplus value since they collectively produced it. And likewise, after making the film, the production workers collectively own the profits since they collectively labored to produce them, too.\n\nIn this way, Rowling receives the full market value of her labor, and so too do the production workers. \n\nWhen you take a look at how Rowling profited off the exploited labor of directors, actors, editors, producers, as well as printers, advertisers, truckers, retailers, etc. it's pretty clear to see that Rowling wouldn't be a billionaire without having exploited workers.",

                          "text": "Decision making is work, sure. And for that he should get paid. But he didn't do $200B worth of work. He can only own that much wealth by owning the sum of the value created by all his workers.\n\nAnd I mean, that's really quite undeniable. I'm sure you understand that if you are hired, it's because you are going to generate more value for the company than they will pay you. I see this all the time at work, where we'll be billed for $200 an hour for some junior engineer's work, when I know that engineer is only making $40 an hour. Each hour of his work creates $200 of value for the company he works at. Meaning he does $200 worth of labor in an hour. But he doesn't get to own that full $200. The remaining $160 belongs to the company. Now of course, that isn't all profit. A large portion of it will go to paying off expenses and debts. Then out of the remaining profit, still another portion will go to new investments. Only a fraction will be saved as profit, and even then most of that profit is really just a contingency for when there's a slowdown in revenue generation, or a major expense somewhere.\n\nEven so, those investments and that overhead and any other remaining profit for things like bonuses and dividend payouts, are all by law the wealth of the company, and by extension its owners. In this way, an owner like Musk expropriates the value generated by his workers and claims it as his personal wealth. And that's how he is worth billions - because he is by law the owner of the value created by other people's work.\n\nNow let's go back and examine what his job is. He is a decision maker, as you said. But what decisions is he making? Simply put, he decides what to do with the company's resources. But as we just saw, the company's resources are paid for by the workers. So really, his job is to manage wealth that other people make. In a way, this sounds a bit like something else - taxes.\n\nTaxes are wealth that other people make. We recognize that the government expropriates a portion of the wealth we create in order to pay for things. And we decided that, if it's our money, then we ought to own whatever it's used for. So we call these things public goods and services. Similarly, since it's our money, we should have a say in how it's managed / who manages it (\"No taxation without representation\" being a prime example of this). So in government, we recognize that the guys making decisions with our money should be accountable to the public, and what they do with the money should be the property of the public. When this isn't the case, we call that a dictatorship.\n\nSo let's zoom back to our workplaces now. We have guys like Musk in charge of our wealth. But we can't hold them accountable, we don't have a say in how the wealth is managed or in who does that managing, and we don't own that wealth nor whatever it is used for. So in effect, we have a dictatorship of the workplace.\n\nSo when you and I say \"Musk is a decision maker and deserves compensation for that\" we both agree and disagree. Yes, decision making is work and work should be compensated. But his decision making is merely concerning the wealth that his workers generate. That doesn't mean he should be compensated with *ownership* of all that wealth. After all, do mid-level managers get rewarded with ownership over all the resources they manage? Of course not. Rather, Musk should be compensated according to what the generators of that wealth decide to pay him. In other words, he should be accountable to his workers. And while he may manage the wealth of the company, ownership of that wealth should belong to the workers who labored to produce it. In this way, the dictatorship of the workplace is replaced with democracy of the workplace, and labor is entitled to all that it creates instead of having its value expropriated to make individuals richer than kings",

So if I care about the workers, I should go to Target and pay more for the crap I want to buy. Otherwise, I\u2019m indirectly supporting all of the optimizations that Amazon is employing to beat Target\u2019s prices.

No. because people buying from Amazon can not be aware and dont have to be aware of the practices in order to consume it (the argument that a consumer has to be perfectly aware of the everything behind their purchases breaks down quickly in real world), nor do they set the compensation for anyone who is creating value in Amazon's production. How can they be even *close*  to the blame of labour being extracted for less than it creates? i.e Bezos",

But it's far less compelling to have a reasonable point of view to challenge, or move the blame to consumer who dont really have all the power outside of collective boycott or 4 yearly votes to change anything about the system.\n\nSo first off, if you have a problem with the practice, you should have a problem with any baker who employs the practice, not just the rich ones. So if a baker underpays his employees, who bake for him, and that\u2019s your concern, the success or failure of the Baker is inconsequential. The only issue is whether he employs the practice. \n\nSecond, you\u2019re absolutely wrong about consumers not having power. Consumers have a ton of power, in general the supply side chases the preferences expressed by the consumption behavior of the demand side. Small changes in consumption behavior result in significant changes on the supply side, different prices and new technologies. We see this in literally every product. \n\nThere\u2019s countless examples. We have 1000 new cryptocurrencies every day because people are buying them. I personally wouldn\u2019t put a dime in crypto, but there\u2019s enough people that want it, that it exists and is growing.",

Likely Congress will also take a sharp turn right coming elections and Trump or a similar candidate is favorite to succeed Biden, which may well be the last free elections you'll have in the US.",

Most conservatives will vote republican in that context, even if they think Trump is the dumbest spoiled brat imaginable, they'd rather vote for him than for somebody who (in their perspective) is pro baby killing (and all that nonsense).\n\n> which may well be the last free elections you'll have in the US.\n\nI mean, I can't show you the future right now, but people said this in 2016\u00a0before Trump got elected, and 2020 still happened. Actually, you'll find people predicting the end of free elections for pretty much every election. It doesn't happen. It's hyperbole...\n\nTo me, it sounds exactly like people predicting the rapture, or the climate version of the same. It's always supposed to be right around the corner. Then the corner comes again and again and again. And nothing happens...\n\nIf the Trump presidency has shown one thing, it's how well the whole \"constitution\" protecting fundamentals is working in the US, and how even if you get the dumbest most toxic person elected, there is in fact very little they can **actually** do...

(note:\u00a0I took a moment to google the claim and could not find a source that supports your point)\n\n(what might be the issue here, is that you haven't defined a goal. as in \"there's only two years left for serious action \\*\\*if we want to achieve X\\*\\*\". how much time we have left does in fact depend a lot on X. but even with that identified as a problem, that's still wrong. no matter what X is, either there are actions we can take to achieve it, or there isn't. there is no deadline either way. if the goal is \"stay under 2 degrees by 2100\", there is no \"two years deadline\" that matters here: there is an amount of action we can take that will get us there, no matter how long we take to implement the action(s)).\n\nIn fact, if I remember correctly, the current goals are 1.5 degrees by 2050 (which would require I\u00a0believe to cut emmission by half, which is achievable, though will require some more policy changes than we currently have)\n\nAlso, there is no point of no return, that's just sensationalistic nonsense.\n\nAlso, serious action is in fact being taken, we have strongly changed the trajectory of the curve over the past two decades, and we will keep doing so. Policy changes (like the Paris/Kyoto accords) have in fact had a massive impact on the long-term outcome. and more such policies are in the work.\n\nAlso, all of those models systematically ignore scientific/technological progress (because it's just too difficult to model), however over the past decade or so, scientific progress has been a massive contributor to improving the situation, in a way that the models didn't predict/account for (wind/solar has seen it's cost divided by over 10, and is becoming the majority of new installations, which was crazy to think about two decades ago). So all those models predicting the 2100 temps, you can expect results to be better than what they predict, thanks (in part) to technological progress. Most people don't seem to realize that currently, scientific progress isn't just increasing, it's \\*\\*accelerating\\*\\*. There are more and more scientists, they have more and more means and better tools. That's causing a current boom in discovery/progress, and a large part of that is helping with climate change.\n\nYou might be reading too much alarmist media and not enough actual science...\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate\\_change\\_scenario#/media/File:Global\\_CO2\\_emissions\\_and\\_probabilistic\\_temperature\\_outcomes\\_of\\_Paris.png](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_scenario#/media/File:Global_CO2_emissions_and_probabilistic_temperature_outcomes_of_Paris.png)\n\nWe need to keep working on the policies and on the technologies, but the notion that we are two years away from a \"point of no return\" is just utter non-scientific nonsense.\n\nWe \\*\\*might\\*\\* have been at the worst point of the curve, 15 years ago (I don't know if we were, I'd need to check), but we clearly aren't today.\n\nQuoting [https://mashable.com/article/climate-change-tipping-points-future](https://mashable.com/article/climate-change-tipping-points-future) :\n\n>\u00ab Though the scientific world is filled with quality, carefully vetted climate research, from time to time a \"point of no return\" study makes its way into a mainstream research journal and, unfortunately, might **get amplified or misinterpreted by some news outlets**. When you see these doomist-type headlines, it's crucial to remember that humanity still has great sway over how much we disrupt the climate in the coming decades. We haven't tipped the global climate, in terms of warming, past a \"point of no return,\" according to climate scientists.  \u00bb\n\nSee also [https://www.ecowatch.com/climate-study-greenhouse-gas-emissions-2648886531.html](https://www.ecowatch.com/climate-study-greenhouse-gas-emissions-2648886531.html)\n\nClimate change IS currently the most important issue humanity is facing.\n\nBut that's no reason to say wrong/incorrect/nonscientific things just because media clickbaited you into believing wrong facts about the science... Actually read the studies, they have nice digestible summaries all around for lay people.",

Last government had the most policy and legislations get dropped by constitutional board. And then there was the sheer fact that the way they tried to do it meant that EU would've instantly had to start issuing penalties and fines for breaching competition laws.. which in turn would've meant full dismantling of the whole public healthcare. This was the problem before the elections, we knew about it and during the 4 years they just could not sort it out. The lesson:\n\nNever elect a CEO to be your PM, especially if they say they are going to run the country like a company. CEO does not have internal constitution, checks and balances, popular support, your own marketing department media sector is protected by laws.... CEO can fire people, order the company announcement to lie, they can do a lot of things that if we apply to nations would require dictatorship and totalitarianism... They are thin skinned, laws are obstacles not the purpose, taxes are evil.. and government can't do anything...\n\nThe current government managed to get the healthcare reform done already... The changes are what experts recommended, it was not such a huge job afterall when there was a fully laid out plan, it was always there, on the table but.. btw, last government also saw a record number of centrist and conservative politicians and aids to move to private healthcare sector... hmm... and the companies started investing right away after elections... hmmm... So.. why would they try something that is unpopular, messy, chaotic and threatens everything... and not the plan that was pretty much a done deal and that protects the current, affordable, public healthcare..\n\nThe plan was to supplement public healthcare with private but keeping the responsibility with the public sector. It works great.. I had a chipped tooth a while ago, went to the private with a government voucher that pays 2/3rds. The other choice was to wait, until it gets worse or that i somehow managed to keep it clean for couple of weeks... There are long lines in dental side, so private is VERY effective \"overflow\" protection. Lines are getting shorter and costs aren't rising... The cost for me was 40\u20ac, i am ok with that cause i got it done the next day, less than 24h. Bureaucracy for the voucher took 30 minutes.",

This is also why they keep using the pedophilia/groomer fears, because they want to paint a picture of a slippery slope towards Dems defending pedophiles. While most of us on the left are primarily focused on economic concerns, where the Democrats are a center right party (like you mentioned). The left in America, has been clamoring for universal healthcare for about 100 years, nothing has changed there. The left has been pretty steady that they want healthcare and decent wages. \n\nSo to people (read idiots) on the right, they seem to think \"first it was black people, then gay people, then trans people, whats next? what group will democrats defend next?\" Which has the easy answer of \"whatever group you attack next\"",

What have you seen to suggest that? (It wouldn\u2019t shock me that right wing people are, since many of them seem to actually like Nazis for some reason.) \n\nIn the context of defending the country, I could sort of understand why various people don\u2019t \u201cget\u201d the problem with applauding these guys, but that doesn\u2019t make it right, or smart, and certainly nothing i or anyone I know would approve of. \n\nHowever, Ukraine\u2019s so called \u201cnazi problem\u201d is blown hugely out of proportion though, mostly by Russia but also by Glenn Greenwald for whatever reason.

Those warriors have obviously scared the crap out of Russians. All day every day, the Russian shills whine about Azov. They try guilting us into not supporting them, ffs. \"Wahhh, not fair, they're nazis!!!\"\nAbsolute Glory to Azov!\n\n2\n\n>Now I know why the ruzzian trolls keep constantly posting bullshit about Azov being neo-nazis. They're absolutely fucking terrified of them.\n\n3\n\n>I no longer care what the \u201cideology\u201d of the big bad Azov Battalion is. For as evil as Russia says they are, Azov is not tie ones murdering children and raping women. No matter how much Western leftists will kick and scream and whine about Azov, at the end of the day they are the ones supporting the true monsters from Russia.\n\n4\n\n>I can't believe that at the beginning of the war, most of the world fell for the propaganda that the AZOV were Nazi scum whose only saving grace was that they fighting for Ukraine. These guys are beyond outstanding, their defense and care for the citizens sheltered with them is next-level heroism. AZOV has become the definition of tenacity and bravery under fire.We can now see that much of the Nazi symbolism was fake and photoshopped. It's a shame that much of this Nazi symbolism wasn't viewed with a critical eye before the war. Glory to the Heroes.\nBTW, almost all armies have some contingent of self-identifying Nazis. The American military has plenty.\n\n5\n\n>Azov in English = \"Absolute fucking legends\". Their stand will be spoken of for millennia as a stud group of citizen warriors that wiped their asses with the soul of the Russian army and then pissed on it.",

They may chip at it, slowly but they won't say \"we need to privatize it\".. In Finland our conservatives and right wing populists both support affordable healthcare, free education, childcare etc. and the only differences between the extremes are mere details.. in fact, right wing has demanded higher pay for nurses (which is paid by stopping foreign aid... lol..) and lowering of costs to citizens.... Which is 180 degrees difference to US right wing.   \n\n\nEuropean right wing is \"leftist\" in many areas but those are pretty much all things that are supported by almost full majority of voters, we get 80%, 90% support on those institutions among public. So, tories being left from DNC is 100% bullshit and the reason is understandable: because Europe is not USA, things are more complicated here and way, way more simplistic in USA. US right wing hates everything that the government provides but in Europe they consider some of those things no-brainers.. US right wing is a monolith and staunchly at the moment just anti-DNC.

Quite often they are the strongest supporters of those institutions, at least when it comes to campaigns. What they do once in power is different. One you give affordable or free healthcare, people don't want them to ever stop... Which is why US right wing is SO hellbent on their culture war, cause they know that once people are given something that makes their lives better they will never want that to change.

                      "text": ">ask yourself if Obama/2008 dems would have ever even had a conversation many of the more leftie policies today, like student loan debt forgiveness\n\n[About that:](https://www.sofi.com/learn/content/average-student-debt-after-college/#:~:text=While%20the%20average%20student%20loan%20debt%20continues%20to,the%20class%20of%202019%2C%20according%20to%20US%20News.)\n\n>According to data compiled by US News, the cost of attending college with in-state tuition at public National Universities increased by 72% from 2008 to 2021.\n\n>Over roughly that same period of time (from 2010 to 2020), total outstanding student loan debt grew from $845 billion to $1.7 trillion in order to cover those costs.\n\nTuition increased at a very high rate and total student loan debt ballooned by a factor of two. Figure that we also got hit with a recession immediately and that the job market was very tight for many of those graduates and, yeah, it became a much bigger problem. [That doesn't mean no one was talking about student loans though.](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/26/us/politics/26loans.html) It's just that the proposals passed put a band-aid on the problem instead of addressing it.\n\n>trans rights\n\nWell, yeah. Trans people weren't as visible back then. Gay rights kind of dominated the conversation and trans rights\u2014something many people still can't wrap their heads around\u2014are an extension of that conversation. [By 2003, only 29 states and five territories repealed their anti-sodomy laws](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_the_United_States), laws that were found unconstitutional back in 1986. And there are examples of them being used still after that! Don't Ask, Don't Tell was still a thing until 2011 where any openly gay (or non-cis really) person couldn't even serve in the military. And that's to say nothing of the lopsided legality of gay marriage and adoption. But again, a lot of trans rights is an extension of the same conversation being rehashed with a lot of the same attacks being levied against it, especially since conservatives are still trying to fight the gains that did happen.\n\nSo saying that there was a left shift is reasonable, but we've had small gains in stone areas (the old MLK, gains that didn't cost the government anything) and a whole lot of nothing otherwise while the problems have either shifted (now it's the TRANS AGENDA pedophiles coming after your kids!) or worsened (wealth gap? Debt crisis? Just get a better job and work harder, ya big dummy).",

Biden is pondering student debt, not because it aligns with his own ideology but because it might be popular, and it might actually boost economy at the same time.. It is a political move but then again.. it being popular policy says that there is a slight shift that has happened.

You are right that 40 years ago, gay and trans civil rights were practically non-existent, but at the same time there also weren\u2019t widespread conspiracy theories that the government was secretly run by the gay agenda, and that laws are required to prevent the spread of \u201cLGBT ideology\u201d or \u201ccritical race theory,\u201d or else risk the country falling apart or some shit. I argue that what the right is rooting for today is just as bad as back then, but just from a different angle. \n\nOf course, there\u2019s also the fact that economically, the overton window undeniably has shifted right. Whereas things like unionization used to be treated as universal aspects of the economy, and stuff like expanding social security and even universal healthcare seemed just around the corner, today these things are practically unheard of, except for people like Bernie Sanders who are very much outliers of the Democratic party (I\u2019d also argue that this is really what Elon is talking about through thinly veiled 2016-era edge). \n\nOverall I\u2019d say it\u2019s far too naive to say that both left and right have shifted left, especially when it seems like Roe v. Wade might be on the chopping block soon, and conservatives are increasingly encroaching on public education to become more \u201cpatriotic\u201d. You can really only say that if you focus on the amount of rainbow flags per capita and nothing else.",

He is, after Trump, the most hopeful for getting the Republican nomination for president and his approval rates among Republicans are still high. \n\nLaws are getting passed all over banning trans kids from participating in sports. There are currently ongoing hate campaigns against LGBTQ+ suicide hotlines, accusing them of grooming children. And you might say \u201cwell, that there is an LGBTQ+ suicide hotline to begin with is a good thing!\u201d But you\u2019re missing the forest for the trees. \n\nThe fact of the matter is that if the wrong people manage to get the right opportunity, the damage they can do could be catastrophic. We\u2019ve seen this with Trump, and thankfully he only cared enough to fill his own pockets and cared too little or had too little political experience to do more to further the conservative agenda. \n\nI\u2019d like to believe you that the Roe v. Wade debacle is just posturing, but when three SCOTUS members are openly supportive of overturning it - something that was literally completely unheard of in the Supreme Court before 2010 - I\u2019m beginning to doubt it very much. \n\nAlso you\u2019ve just conveniently ignored the fact that economically the country has only been shifting right closer and closer towards an oligarchic technocracy with no signs of slowing down. Not to mention the increasing threat of climate disaster at which congress only seems willing to bring a handpick rather than the sledgehammer necessary. \n\nThe fact of the matter is most of the progress we\u2019ve made over the last 50 years can easily be undone should bad actors be given the opportunity.

Even assuming it is, that's an exception in the developped world. It'll correct at some point. It's getting better pretty much everywhere else, the US is just a bit weird.\n\n> The fact of the matter is most of the progress we\u2019ve made over the last 50 years can easily be undone should bad actors be given the opportunity.\n\nThat's not supported by anything. I'll even say it's nonsense.\n\nWe went from (nearly) all of the population being against interracial marriage, to (nearly) all of the population being for it. There is nothing (short of a big alien ship with a mind-control ray) that is going to revert that.\n\nThat's true of most civil rights/social progress.\n\nYou read too much sentationalistic/panic-inducing media. They always promise things are going to get worse, but it only ever does in small/specific cases/moments, and they completely ignore the fact that overall, it keeps getting better in pretty much all regards (all of them if you take enough steps back).",

Just becabuse a billionare, not just a normal one either, the richest one to ever live, would make \"less money\" is not really my concern. No one should be allowed to have that much money. Period.

The average pay for everyone that makes the teslas average out to 22.16/hr. While UAW workers average 25.37 /hr.\nSo he underpays worker on average by at least $3 an hour, yeah I would say that's bad and they need to unionize to get better pay. Also multiple saftey violations as listed above.\n\nTldr it went bad. \n\nOnce again, he did not take the initial risk with tesla, he's just a finance bro.

I might sometimes use more words to say the same things because English isn't my native language, but it's crazy that you don't realize \\*everything\\* you complain I do, applies to exactly what you are doing/have been doing...\n\n(also no idea what a Nathan Shapiro is, wasn't I\u00a0just talking about \"living in one's little bubble\"?)\n\n>  I\u2019m quite fond of conversations myself, but not one-sided arguments \n\nIt's one-sided because you don't address any of the arguments, and you just talk about me personally and my character (or rather your imagined version of my character, you clearly have been all wrong, as we've seen before).\n\nSeriously. Go back in the conversation, take note of where actual arguments were made, and take note of where they weren't addressed. You'll see very obviously why this conversation is one-sided.\n\n> where one person that literally everybody is disagreeing with\n\nYou're not everybody ... damn dude...\n\n> acting like some kind of deep thinking intellectual\n\nPoint out where I did that.\n\nI didn't. I said I didn't agree, and I explained why. Millions of people do that in Reddit comments every day. And they aren't \"acting like some kind of intellectual\". They are just trying to have a conversation.\n\nClearly you have a weird thing where if somebody disagrees with you, you imagine them a certain way, and you can't see them any other way...\n\n> In all likelihood you are a troll, \n\nAnd there you go again ... when one can't actually present arguments, there's always name-calling.

That's *precisely* what I think of you...\n\nAnd I'm generally much less caustic, but here I've been called a troll and an antagonistic asshole just for expressing my views, so yes, I'm a bit less nice than I usually am.\n\nAll of that just for expressing my point of view.

Go back far enough, it was probably close to 0% even for progressives...\n\nSure, you got 50 states, there are going to be exceptions.\n\nDoesn't change the trend.\n\nThings are improving even among the most religious (which is really the demographic that has the most problems with gay marriage, even more than just \"conservatives\"): [http://www.religioustolerance.org/pewssm2.png](http://www.religioustolerance.org/pewssm2.png)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWant an even more obvious examples?\n\n1990: 63% of non-blacks would not want a relative to marry an african american person.\n\n2016, it's 14% (over 4 times less in 26 years, and still on a steep decline. old people take a long time to die, it's nearly nil in the younger generations). A separate study has the number at 6%.\n\n(note the way these studies are done/worded, they do not \\*necessarily\\* denote overt racism:\u00a0the question is about what would be good for the person, that is, some people don't want their relative to marry outside their ethnicity \\*because\\* of fear of racism that would result)\n\n(you'll also note interracial marriage themselves are in a strong increase. societies change...)\n\nFun fact: would not want a relative to marry an atheist: 27%.",

And those votes do not mean the people support everything that's been done or lied about. It just means they like the other guy ('s politics) even less.

I'd like to hear that one. I could almost guarantee, you heard from a right wing pundit, who made it up in order to manufacture fake outrage. The real issue is complicated, and in all honesty trans kids are only recently being listened to, and advocated for. This article gives the recommendation from the endocrine society, which makes sense to me.\n\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/sex-change-treatment-for-kids-on-the-rise/ \n\nBasically kids can \"transition\" whenever they and their parents decide to, but before puberty that will mostly just consist of cross dressing and a name change. Once puberty gets close, they can take puberty blocking medication until they turn 16, at which point they can begin hormone therapy. The surgery can be done at 18. If it was even a \"leftist\" who you heard this from, they could have trolling, or just a random idiot. I cannot find even a small sect of the \"radical left\" advocating for what you say. \n\nThis was the only thing I could even find on what you're talking about\n\nhttps://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/mar/05/viral-image/no-young-children-cannot-take-hormones-or-change-t/",

The only reason Trump wasn't locked up for treason with Putin is that no US president has ever collaborated with the enemy so there was no need to have a law against it.  Incidentally a second Russian agent from the GOP was also actively lying in helsinki, to promote Putin and that was Rand Paul.  A video just surfaced of John McCain reiterating that Rand Paul is a Russian agent.\n\nThat would mean Putin has run three agents of his for US president, Trump, Paul and Tulsi gabbard.",

He was rigged into office in 2016 by Putin and both he and Putin kind of admit is proudly.   He grifted taxpayers and supporters out of nearly a billion dollars and took foreign bribes about the same, 500 million from the Chinese and saudis alone, not even including his laundering 20 billion+ for Putin and the Russian mob before that.  \n\nTrump also lied 35,000 times in four years just in public, and his pro covid lies alone resulted in 700,000 extra deaths and an extra trillion dollar in lost economic activity, which we are still paying for and which caused a lot of the inflation.  Whatever problems we face now, especially Putin, covid-related or inflationary, have absolutely nothing to do with Biden's actions or lack thereof.  All he has done is making things much better or much less awful.  and try as you might but you never find a single lie Biden has told, just the usual spin occasionally. Biden is an honest man, a true patriot, a good and decent man and against Putin is proving to be our greatest commander in chief since FDR.\n\nBut you want Putin to win, don't you Igor?",

We all need to go back to when I was being admired and adored for my sociopathy! Because it's just so exhausting pretending to care so if everyone else could change around me so I'm always viewed as good that'd be excellent. I mean I'm saving humanity guys, remember? REMEMBER! I SAID LOVE ME GOD DAMNIT! I'M A GOOD PERSON! IT'S ALL YOU WHO HAVE CHANGED AND BECOME BAD! is it working? Do you love me again?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit: probably an unpopular opinion but we need to feel empathy for sociopaths, psychopaths and narcissists. They didn't choose to be born or raised in a manner that led to them being the way they are and showing a lack of concern for them as human beings only gives them less reason to see being part of society as beneficial and drives them harder to using people to get what they feel they need. Praise when it's warranted and shame when it's warranted can help them become functional members of society to the greatest extent they are able and there are some skills/jobs they excel at over others when they have the motivation to pursue them",

And the culture he was creating meant people were ignoring the fact checkers entirely. At some point you have to treat him like any other account spreading dangerous misinformation, especially one in such a position of power.    \n\nAnd irrespective of freedom of speech, the graph is wrong. There\u2019s no way to measure \u201chow left is the left\u201d because of all the axis, subjectiveness, and sheer number of people. And does he really think that the left has just collectively shifted miles to the left, while the right has stayed the same?   \n\nAnd on a more _personal_ note, he\u2019s trying to appeal to people who are taking away women\u2019s rights, causing the spread of disease, and denying climate change. And I know this is emotional, and probably bad, but I\u2019m afraid. I feel like if he keeps appealing to them, then climate denial will get worse, and we won\u2019t fix it. I don\u2019t want to watch the Earth\u2019s biosphere collapse around me, and millions of people die. I know it\u2019s selfish, but I just don\u2019t want to see it. It feels unfair, and horrifying.   \n\nAnd frankly, because of that, I don\u2019t mind if climate deniers get banned. They\u2019re lying anyway. They are unequivocally wrong. Their freedom of speech may be important, but they are spreading dangerous misinformation and that misinformation might kill me and the things I love. Not to mention, I have never seen a _good_ climate denier. They\u2019re just unpleasant. They\u2019re arrogant, obnoxious, overconfident, rude, loud, stupid and cannot have a debate without strawmanning everyone. I don\u2019t think anyone will miss their arguments.",

I\u2019m going to assume that his intentions to preserve free speech are true and I don\u2019t think his character is brittle enough to fall short of this because of an inability to take criticism. Also he doesn\u2019t plan on moderating it all himself, he simply wants to put the correct systems in place to do so, such as making it open source so people can see exactly how Twitter will be managed and handle the blocking of accounts etc. allowing it to be publicly criticised. The previous set-up was all decided behind closed doors and we have to take Twitters word on how it is managed - which I don\u2019t know about you but I find it hard to believe everything they say, especially when they have little obligation to show anyone how it\u2019s decided behind the scenes. The censorship of the Hunter Biden laptop story is a good example. \n\nThe laws on free speech obviously vary from country to country but considering the company is American, I imagine it will use American law as basis (but how this will work out exactly in different countries I have no idea). But yes obviously true Nazism shouldn\u2019t be tolerated at all on any platform. \n\nYou may not have seen it but yea I definitely saw the word dictator getting thrown around in these comments, along with a lot of other far-fetched insults. My only issue with using that kind of language is it loses its meaning when constantly used incorrectly.\n\nLike someone else mentioned, I\u2019d like to have known how Elon would\u2019ve handled the Trump situation, it\u2019s definitely complicated. I agree that former presidency doesn\u2019t put you above the rules but was what he said truly glorification of violence? Some of the tweets I saw that were labelled as this didn\u2019t seem like it in my opinion. I think there\u2019s a possibility that the higher ups at Twitter categorised it as this with some slight bias. \n\nLike I mentioned though you raised some fair points.",

For example some content showing swastikas would be blocked in Germany while still visible in the US. That's what YouTube has done a few times.\n\nI sure hope he will treat online extremism consistently, but I don't have much confidence in that.",

That way it can be trusted. \n\nOn the Covid topic, like everything else it is very complicated. The issue with the censorship is yeah sure idiots have been spewing COVID misinformation, but also many people have been speaking truths and genuine concerns and getting shutdown nonetheless. \nThis stretches outside of COVID, what do you make of the Hunter Biden laptop news story that was taken down? I think suspending a major news organisation for publishing a truthful article is very inappropriate. \n\nYou come across as very arrogant and presumptuous. I\u2019m aware that more right wing extremism exists compared to left, it\u2019s better for everybody that no one has to deal with the bollocks of it all. I\u2019m talking about the subtle stuff like censorship of criticism of Joe Biden. It shouldn\u2019t exist at all, you should be able to criticise Donald Trump just as easily as Joe Biden or any other political figure. It\u2019s a genuine concern and Musk wants to make aspects like the algorithm that prioritises tweets to be made public. \n\nIt\u2019s not just Twitter that\u2019s guilty either, Facebook does it as well. The run up to the presidential election was when there was a huge increase in removal of posts painting Biden in bad light. As a random example off the top of my head, one was just a picture of him kissing is granddaughter on the lips ffs. Why would they remove that?\n\nI get that you believe strongly in speaking the truth and stopping the spread of misinformation (so do I believe it not), but when the company that has the power to block and censor seems to be doing so very inconsistently, of course it is a cause for concern for many.\n\nLastly, by adding all those insults to your response, you come across as a lot less self aware than how you tried to make me look.",

Everything's going swimmingly for several months until I come on there and start spewing things you don't agree with, things you wouldn't want your name attached to. Doesn't matter what it is, but something deeply offensive to you and your family, something utterly embarrassing to have your name and investment attached to. You'd be foolish not to remove me from your property.  \n  \nNow, imagine you tried to remove me from your property, but because I happen to be some kind of government official I get the authorities to pay you a visit and explain to you, \"We understand this is your property, and that you have the right to exercise your free speech, and we being the government are not allowed to take that away from you... But, y'know, we like this guy and we're going to force you to host his content on your property, and we're just not going to allow you to actually exercise your free speech by disallowing you moderate the content that your platform is publishing.\"  \n  \nIf it was me in that position, presuming the courts are going to uphold this (which would be absurd), I feel like my only choice is to shut the platform down to preserve my integrity. Nobody gets to use it now. It just leads to us not being able to have nice things. If the government was running the social media site, it'd be a different story. If social media was considered to be essential communication utilities like a telephone company and regulated similarly, it'd be a different story. But it's not, it's (in this example) just you or me having built a thing and running a thing that we allow people to use.  \n  \nLet's say you were rich and bought Madison Square Garden and in the next big election some Proud Boy gets elected President or something. You really think it's appropriate that the government could force you to host KKK rallies at your Madison Square Garden once a month? Cuz that'd be akin to forcing Twitter to host Trump.  \n  \n>I know he can be an arsehole but the precedent that was set by Twitter blocking Trump really worried me.  \n  \nNo precedent was set, it's been this way for a very, very long time. If Trump wants to hold a rally on your property he needs your permission, it's the same sort of concept.  \n  \n>He has been quoted several times that he wants to stop censorship with Twitter and allow free speech:\u201cBy 'free speech', I simply mean that which matches the law. I am against censorship that goes far beyond the law. If people want less free speech, they will ask government to pass laws to that effect. Therefore, going beyond the law is contrary to the will of the people,\". How can he say something like this and still be likened to a dictator like I\u2019ve seen in the comments??  \n  \nDoesn't even make sense to me. Twitter had already been providing 'free speech' which matches the law. That is, it's Twitter's platform, it's Twitter exercising their free speech when they moderate content on their platform, and the government is not restricting anyone's speech. Nothing (censorship in particular) went *beyond* the law, as the law protects Twitter's freedom of speech. That being said, under Elon's ownership he is welcome to change Twitter's policy and continue operating within the law and any changes will ultimately be an expression of Twitter's/Elon's free speech.  \n  \nFurthermore, if people want less free speech, they'd be foolish to ask the government to pass laws to that effect, as the First Amendment to the US Constitution prevents the government from doing precisely that. \n  \n>Congress shall make no law... abridging the freedom of speech...",

That is so insane it's hard to comprehend. Kids have questions, and teaching them about others who aren't exactly like you goes a long way toward cooperation and understanding. This bill makes it so that if teachers try to do that, parents can sue? It's nuts. How does Desantis make the leap that instruction/discussion on gender identity is sexualization. WTF",

This is one hospital that for some reason has decided 17 is old enough for vaginoplasty (M to F bottom surgery) if you've been living full time in that gender for a year. They also decided Metoidioplasty and phalloplasty (different versions of F to M bottom surgery) age requirement is 18, and I'm not sure why the difference. I personally disagree, and think you should be a legal adult to make that decision, but 17 isn't a little kid either. It's old enough to fight and die in war as well. I would like to hear their reasoning on the difference for the lower age allowance. Especially on why they feel 17 is old enough for for vagino, but not old enough for metoidio/phallo. Either way, I think at best you're being hyperbolic with Chemical castration for kids bit.",

Just so you're aware, the term \"genital mutilation\" is a term that is often used by transphobic people to discredit surgeries that trans people get to alleviate gender dysphoria, which is typically referred to as SRS (or Sex Reassignment Surgery) or GRS (Gender Reassignment Surgery). Genital mutilation implies that these surgeries are destroying a person's genitals, however this far from the truth. Not only is it proven to help trans people's gender dysphoria, the recreated genitals are often completely, if not almost entirely functional. While science is still not to a point where we can recreate the ability to achieve creating a child, we're not too far away from that either. For those interested, the citations linked below expand and explain what these surgeries do for trans people. These surgeries are backed by multiple medical, mental health, and health institutions, which goes to prove how effective they are for trans people overall. \n\n---\n\n^(This is like a TAS for debunking pseudoscience on the internet.

Complained that people who didn't like his comedy any more were \"too sensitive\" or \"woke\" when hes simply not as culturally relevant to the younger generations. It's a good thing though.

The meme perfectly shows that. As the left embraced traditional right wing fiscal structure, and the right started to slightly adopt (even if begrudgingly) some socially progressive ideas, the center line shifted.\n\nThe far right is just as racist, bigoted, etc as it has always been. Nothing has changed.\n\nThe far left has gone off the rails and down the rabbit hole with social policy, which is what this meme demonstrates. I could get into why but honestly if you can't see it, me explaining it on Reddit won't matter.\n\nTldr; Far left went farther left. Center line shifted left and absorbed former left-centrists onto the center right. Far right has stayed as screwed up as they always have been. People can't read a meme that anyone with basic comprehension and no political bias can easily interpret. Reddit continues to aggressively downvote anyone trying to explain it. All is normal.",

Trump definitely wasn't pulling all US troops out of many different countries because the US had no right to have a military presence there. Trump definitely didn't think that the US is not supposed to be the world police. Trump was a russian agent that didn't help his boss one bit in the 4 years he was one of the most powerful people in the world. Seems like he is either an idiot or a terrible operative.",

Like how is CRT a radical idea? It's just a critical observation and analysis on how history affects people of color and why black people tend to end up in worse socio-economic circumstances today. The fact Republican want this banned from schools is rather telling and a better example FOR right-wing radicalization.\n\nI'm not even sure what you mean when you say alternative history. Do you mean new historal discoveries being taught? Can't think of any examples of \"the left\" advocating for fake history being taught.\n\nI disagree with gender being fluid, but then again never looked too deep into the scientific theories behind gender. Just seems like much of the progressive ideas there conflate gender with gender roles.\nOn the other hand I have also never seen any examples of radical gender ideas being taught in school, just the right fear mongering about in and then just referring to standard SexED.\n\nGreat that you can bring up one person that keeps being brought up here.\nWhat about all the ex-Republican presidents and Republican politicians that believe Trump is way too radical? Really can play the same game.\n\nLiberals complained that Trump won the election, nothing wrong with complaining about the political opponent.\nYet... Clinton actually conceded...\nThe main questioning that liberals brought up about the elections legitimacy was about Russians spreading pro-Trump propaganda online.\nThere were at least no major allegations of rigged voting machines, votes being created out of thin air or any of the other nonsense Trump and other Republicans have cooked up.\nThere wasn't any liberals storming the Capitol, claiming they will stop the certification of the election.\n\nAgain, look at Qanon a genuine cult with fascist beliefs, that was actively encouraged by Trump.

Also, I'm a registered Independent- so I am not beholden to either party- although of the two, the Republican party is currently absolutely less batshit crazy than the Democrats. When one party has black bloc morons running around actually using fascistic tactics in order to impose their will, strike fear, and scatter opposing ideas- that is rather fascistic. And it almost always happens in \"blue\" dominated parts of the country. I know this, I have witnessed it firsthand; I live in flaming blue \"progressive\" Portland, OR. \n\nEuphemistically throwing a \"progressive\" label to CRT indoctrination is silly- its not going to change the Marxist-inspired motivations behind it- and that of BLM to be honest. I care not for that grifting organization. I simply don't believe our children should be raised up believing they're all part of some power structure and that depending on their skin color, they inherently have advantages over other skin colors. That's racist in of itself- I'm not going to be lectured by CRT proponents on racism, racism history, etc. I was taught US history- the good and the bad- turns out, common sense study of the past without the idiotic Howard Zinn commentary is best. To put it bluntly- teach it without any narrative driven bias.\n\nRegarding gender ideology- have you not seen any of those school committee meetings where parents were outraged upon learning what their child was being taught in school? Or seeing it when their kid was at home \"zoom\" learning? Tell you what- take a look at a news source you normally don't look at- because I think we're both intelligent enough to acknowledge that different media outlets cater to their audience. FOX for the Right and CNN/MSNBC for the Left. That is not debatable. I'm also not suggesting you look at FOX- try something else, like Daily Wire. You will notice that they'll cover something that often your preferred networks/outlets will not. \n\nI grow wearing of people like you pretending away Communist influence. Like seriously, you think your dismissive attitude about it is going to sway me? You're seriously going to pretend Bernie Sanders, AOC and their ilk are figments of our imagination? You're going to pretend that trying to cement DSA ideology within their party and by extension into the districts isn't a thing? Time for a gut check, sul\\_haren..",

Unless you want to imply these countries with rather high quality of life are communist.\nBernie regards himself as Democratic Socialist, but based on his policies and inspirations I'm not convinced of that. Unless he has values beyond the policy he deems realistic to implement.\n\nBesides even assuming they stand fully behind Democratic Socialist ideas.\nThat's still the most moderate form of socialism that exists and far away from communism.\n\nAlso may I remind you Bernie and AOC oppose the Democratic establishment? They're not at all representative of the general Democrat.\nHell Bernie isn't even in the party.\n\nThe US is one of the most economically right-wing countries on the planet, you couldn't be further away from communism.",

That's not being left-wing, that's being a weak corporate party, that's afraid from touching left-wing politics.\n\nAlso people are mostly mad at the Dems for the high gas prices, even if the US still have some of the lowest in the world, so obviously the party is hardly to blame. Maybe the overturning of RvW will change that now, since the majority of the US supports abortion (good example of the right becoming more radical again) or everything that came to light during the January 6th hearing (one again far-right radicalization of the Republicans).\n\n>AOC/Bernie both are darlings of the Left/Democrats\n\nOf the left? Sure, partly at least. Communists usually really dislike them.\n\nDems also is very mixed, most establishment Dems tolerate them at best and AOC also constantly attacks establishment Dems for not doing any of the left-wing actions they promise.\nThey most definitely do not control the party. It's insane enough that someone like Biden and AOC even share a party, these two are almost opposite on the political spectrum. Though that's US politics for you, the two party system forces moderately right-wing liberals and democratic socialists to share a party, because their only other choice is the far-right.\n\nLook, even Nixon looks almost moderate in comparison to the modern Republicans. There absolutely has been a shift to the right for the whole country. I mean come on, FDR's class conflict politics used to be well liked making him one if the most popular presidents. If a Dems nowadays would suggest policies like he did, people would cry far-left communist at them.\n\nHell, the guy that this post is about recently proudly proclaimed that he voted a Qanon supporter.\n\nThis is not just a phenomenon of the US, globally the world has economically moved further right since the popularization of neoliberalism with politicians like Reagan and Thatcher.\n\nI've given you so many examples on why it's the right that's radicalizing in the US and you have barely addressed a single one. Idk why I'm even arguing with you.",

Fuel prices only went up from day 1 into Biden's presidency. The distraction in Ukraine further jacked the prices up. Some of us believe it is by design- to dissuade people from fossil fuels. Many on the Democratic said have said as much. Here's an example: Sen. Debbie Stabenow: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T01rGfBAvnY&ab\\_channel=GOPWarRoom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T01rGfBAvnY&ab_channel=GOPWarRoom)\n\nDo you realize that is some high level ivory tower shit? You really think that wins people over? Instead of whining about student loan relief (THEY signed up for it- I'm SICK of the idea that my taxes ought to go towards bailing them out), how about we credit 10's of thousands towards EV vehicles for people- now THERE'S an incentive (and NOT a punishment). If our elected leaders can \"send\" 10's of billions in \"aid\" to Ukraine, surely we can prioritize our own people by incentivizing a massive electrical infrastructure for more and more EVs on the road.",

You realize that over 1 million people have switched over to Republican since 2021? [https://theweek.com/republicans/1014699/over-1-million-voters-switched-to-the-republican-party-over-the-last-year](https://theweek.com/republicans/1014699/over-1-million-voters-switched-to-the-republican-party-over-the-last-year) Have you wondered why? Don't you think your party has become just a little bit insane?\n\nUkraine-Russia. Sorry but the Left/Democrats are garbage on this. Even the Right/Republicans. They just are. But here, you are playing a classic Leftist trope by immediately declaring me a \"conspiracy theorist\" and thus a crazy kook that can easily be dismissed simply because I don't see that conflict from the same angle as you. I'm not going to believe the \"news\" coming from there. I'm just not. Just so you know- I know more than a few people from Ukraine, Moldova and Romania. At least acknowledge that they're getting a completely different flavor of \"news\" regard Ukraine-Russia when America is. And then you will have to admit that even you aren't being fed the whole story. Make what you will of that idea. I care not. I also simply refuse to blindly fly a Ukrainian flag \"in solidarity\" at my home- and especially in lieu if an American flag. \n\nGas prices going up all over the world is simply \"yeah but a similar thing is happening over there!\" type of argument. I've heard this argument- mainly from the Left- that of \"hey, its not so bad -I mean those guys over there are paying a bit more so be happy we're not there!\". Again- you can clearly see gas prices on the upswing well before Russian troops walked into Ukraine. Suggesting its \"Putin's gas hike\" completely misses the forest for the trees. Nobody denies it added to the surge. But nobody serious actually believes its solely Russia's fault. \n\n\"The left cares about the most basic moderate leftist policies (college is cheap in most other countries). Huh, I wonder why?\" The Left has been in power multiple times and have had multiple opportunities to stifle out of control college costs. They've not done a thing about it. \n\n\"While I think nonbinary ideas are stupid, I believe they're overall a non-issues. They don't do much harm in comparison to many conservative, right-wing beliefs.\" Utter BULLSHIT. You are NOT paying attention, you fool. So many young kids- children and on up to teens- are being fed the LIE that they can safely transition, in order to play along with delusional beliefs, by way of chemical castration or even physical (butchering of sexual organs. There is NO longitudinal study on the long-term ramifications of what these so-called doctors and psychiatrists are doing in the name of \"gender affirming care\" - one of the greatest and most insulting euphemisms I've heard in a long time. Gender affirming care, my ass. How on earth can anybody defend this vile practice? Doesn't bother you? That's because your side of the aisle pretends its a non-issue. When people on the Left cannot answer basic biological questions, like \"what is a woman\" then you know you're part of a cultish party that champions party ideals over reality. Most ALL of those people can answer it- they just know that they have to tow the party line.\n\nGlad you agree on the EV thing. Environmentalism shouldn't be a divisive issue.",

They always have been.\nThe average voter cares more about things he directly sees like gas-prices, than actual policy.\n\nNvm that partly this is part of a new (admittedly awful) Democratic voter strategy, that vote the more extreme Republicans in primaries, thinking that moderate Republicans would never vote them against the Democratic candidate.\nThey don't seem to realize that Republicans have radicalized so much that they will still vote the Republican candidate, no matter how insane.\nThis line of thinking us what lead to Trump, MTG, Boebert and all those other radical Republicans that have popped up recently.\n\n>Don't you think your party has become just a little bit insane?\n\nI think you fail to realize the Democrats are not my party.\nThey're liberals, they are center-right.\nI'm left-wing.\nThey're \"insane\", but I'm pretty sure you mean on other things than I do.\n\n>Ukraine-Russia.

Plenty of cult analists have done essays about the subject (not like you really need those, since it should be obvious to anyone even paying a tiny bit of attention to the movement).\n\n>Environmentalism shouldn't be a divisive issue.\n\nSadly it is. The right has been denying the clear science for years. Republicans tend to block anything combating climate change (not just them, the right in most countries does).

When he started Tesla he invested his money towards electric vehicles would have been celebrated by democrats since it started the EV revolution. He is saying he never changed but opinions of him has. \n\nI can understand some of your points towards why democrats vilify him. And maybe an unpopular opinion but the workers can leave or even start a union. He used a plant that is in a union friendly state/ built another in a more socialist country  unlike almost manufacturers who have built in anti union states or Mexico. As far as taxes are concerned Tesla through corporate taxes and income taxes has paid a lot. But when all his money is tied into shares there is no reason to sell shares just to pay taxes no one would do it unless they need cash. Which he doesn\u2019t. It would also devalue the stocks for Tesla. \n\nYes I know they are separated but she has stated in her vanity fair article and song how much she still loves him. \n\nI will not argue which Party has radicalized more as I would agree with you. But back to my previous point, I believe that democrats have further moved away from him than he has moved towards Republicans. Even though IMO opinion he has not changed as a person other than maybe too comfortable now to state opinions. \n\nI am not centrist. I don\u2019t like the status quo. I would have liked to see Bernie Sanders as much as Trump to be president just to shake up the US. I want to see ideas being tried that work and there is some from both sides of the aisle. I liked that Trump went after China with tariffs when both sides thought it was bad idea. But the rest of his term not so much.",

The truth is that the center was always where democrats were, and republicans were more conservative.

He likely feels that his views are still liberal, but often it seems that the far left thinks that if you aren\u2019t all the way out on the ledge with them, then you are nearly as bad or even just as bad as conservatives.  I don\u2019t think that is incorrect, I have dealt with some people of that mindset in recent years, and while I lean left, it just isn\u2019t good enough for them, and I get name called and talked down to like I am a terrible person because I think for myself.\n\nHope this clarifies, and in closing, Fuck Elon Musk.",

Difference is Bezos is self-made, he isn't lying to the public and he isn't making projects that are stupid as fuck and will never ever work. You can pretend that Elon is some sort of super special billionaire but he isn't.

You have a antisemite muslim in congress who wears full saudi level religious garb and pretends to be far left wing. That's the state of the american left. I say this as a muslim.\n\nMusk is onyl slightly incorrect in that this is what the internet is but that is good context for his post. People like Biden win primaries because the people on reddit and twitter are irrelevant. Everyone who will be mad about my comment and 90% of the people commenting under this are who he's talking about and he thinks they have more power than they have. It's just annoying to have to listen to whining from irrelevant people who don't matter dominating all media sources as we elect people in spite of them. As a biden voter who will for sure vote for hillary if that's an option i'll just laugh ast hey call me 'far right' and say shit 'in europe you would be alt-right' and other moronic internet braindead progressive slogans. \n\nProgressives are dumber than trump voters because at least trump voters are politically relevant. Progressives ensure they won't be yet still are dangerous as they sabotage liberalism on purpose in temper tantrums that trump supporters would never do.",

Politics have become more partisan but the positions are the same on the right. Based on this metric Kamala Harris was called the most liberal senator not because she's left of Bernie Sanders but because she is unwilling to compromise with the right.\n\nOther charts that I've seen arbitrarily define the center based on European politics.. There's also no differentiation between social and economic policy\n\nProgressives progress, conservatives conserve.. the current left is just the right in 20 years.\n\nThere's clips of Obama advocating to punish employers who hire a illegal immigrants.\n\nClips of Bernie calling unfettered border migration a Koch brothers proposal.\n\nClips of Biden advocating against direct amnesty for illegals. \"They gotta work for 11 years, pay a fine, learn to speak English, pass a test\" \n\nNow the party line is remove stay in Mexico policy, get rid of title 42, decriminalize border crossings, and full amnesty. \n\nThat's just on immigration. I mean the right is fully embraced modern monetary theory no one's talking about deficits anymore. \n\nThe left to shifted the Overton window. Obama was anti-gay marriage his first term...
