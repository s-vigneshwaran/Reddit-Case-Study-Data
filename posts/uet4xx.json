  "text": "TIFU By communicating with my wife\nYou know how one of the most important parts of a healthy relationship is communication?\n\nThat thought was on my mind this morning when I woke up next to my wife. The morning sunlight made her skin glow with an aura I'm sure one could only see through my eyes.\n\nI shuffled over to her side of the bed, trying to be as gentle as I could. I wanted to preserve that moment but I couldn't resist the urge to be closer to her.\n\nI settled in with my head laying next to hers and looking directly into her beautiful blue eyes. Her closed lids could never hide what I know to be the most lovely pair of eyes I've ever seen.\n\nShe must have felt me there because her eyes began to slowly open.\n\nJust when I thought I couldn't feel any more content in my life, she smiles at me.\n\nI smile right back at her and with the thought of communication on my mind I promptly said \" You don't let me spoon with you while we sleep because you'll fart on my dick right?\"\n\nShe hasn't spoken to me since.\n\nTLDR: I asked my wife if she was afraid of farting on my dick.\n\nWife won't talk to me.",

Then, the big spoon's arm whose shoulder is towards the ceiling must be used to draw the small spoon as close as possible. Once the spoons fall asleep and the spooning slowly breaks down, no significant transition is required and both of them will find themselves in a normal on-the-side sleeping position. This might make the spooning itself slightly lower quality (although not necessarily), but also much more sustainable, so you can legit sleep this way without both of you suffering (let's face it, sleeping on arms hurts the small spoon's neck, too)",
