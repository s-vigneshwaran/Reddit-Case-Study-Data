  "text": "TIFU by obliterating my wife's fish.\nHappened last night.\n\nWife's 8 year old very large goldfish was passing away.  Had dropsy, was suffering, and was on the verge of death.   Wife and I looked into the symptoms and there was practically no hope of him making a recovery, so she asked me to euthanize him.  Looking into methods, it seemed pretty agreed upon that the most effective and quick way to euthanize a fish was blunt force trauma.\n\nNow, when I was a kid my family were huge anglers, and I was designated as the fish killer when it was time to cook them.  Back then, I was told to slam them on the ground as hard as I could.  Well, my 8 year old body wasnt strong enough to kill them instantaneously so I had to do it multiple times.  Honestly it kind of fucked me up a little.\n\nFlash forward to last night, I didn't want that happening again and I wanted it to be painless.  I asked my wife to leave the room because she was very upset and I chose to do the deed by putting the fish in a plastic grocery bag and slamming it on the counter as hard as I possibly could.\n\nThe poor fish was absolutely obliterated.  The force ripped open the bag and sprayed bits of what used to be a goldfish in every direction.  Told my wife to stay upstairs and she started getting suspicious so she comes down after 5 minutes and its just everywhere still.  On the counter, on the stove, on the fridge, on the freaking Christmas tree we still have up, I was still finding pieces of it this morning.  Wife was aghast and traumatized.  Cried until she went to bed.\n\nTL;DR I euthanized my wife's dying fish quickly but in the most visually traumatizing way possible.",

The stripers all died on the way back to the houseboat, but the catfish was still going strong. I emptied the water out of the bucket to suffocate the catfish while I cleaned the other fish. Still kicking. Walked away, came back, the fish is still moving, like \"That the best you can do?!\" I'm starting to feel like a real ahole for torturing this fish, dragging it out just cuz I'm squeamish, so I grab the fish by the tail and start beating it against a fire log to try and end it quick. Whack, whack, whack, WHACK. Still. Alive. This is a badass fish. I finally haul back and with everything I have SLAM this thing's head against the log and it absolutely explodes--blood, brains, gills, goo ALL OVER the front deck of the houseboat, the chairs, the table, the firewood, the floor, the (open) cooler, the gear.  \nI try to clean it up, but what can you do? Finally, I gut it and take off the head and, later, when I'm frying it, this freaking fish starts slowly flopping--in the pan. It was turning itself over. It had NO HEAD.  \nNo one would eat it. I was like, I can't have bludgeoned this thing to death for NOTHING. This may have been the mightiest fish that ever lived! It cannot die in VAIN! So I ate the tough bastard by myself.",

I was so traumatized i didn't want to do anything with it. i just let the poor little guy rot in his cage for like a week before i had the heart to let my dad bury him. (I remember leaving him a super cingey note telling him not to eat my dad if he came back as a zombie out of revenge because i watched that fairly odd parents episode where Timmy's hamster came back and it scared the fuck out of me).\n\nMy sister blames me for the entire thing and still won't let me live it down to this day. I just wanted a pet guinea pig dude, i liked his little squeaks...now i can't look at them without bursting into tears.\n\nRIP Spike, you will be missed... *but not by my dad.*",

Poor girl had terrible seizures her last night and the emergency vet was under construction at the time. So she decided she was done with pets herself.\n  \nWhich is fine - my parents' neighbors' cats love to come visit them, and she also has my Cleo to visit and spoil when she wishes. So she can still enjoy cats without as much attachment and the heartbreak. Nothing wrong with realizing pet ownership isn't for you due to the heartbreak. I hate that part of it myself, but I find my mental health is better with cats in my life - it's just the way I work. And that's fine, too - it's what works for *me*.\n  \nEdit: You absolutely should do what's best for you, and if that means not having pets of your own and just enjoying other people's pets, that's cool. You're still getting to enjoy animals, just on different terms. Nothing at all wrong with that. :)",

He hit me with massive force on my fingers, I raged up amidst the inmense pain, raised my stick with the intention of executing my brother when rational thought came back to me like lightning, evaded him with my swing and hit directly on the tupper, which intantly exploded and filled our faces of putrefact, fermented, rotten fish. Just after that Hiroshima, we exploded (of laughter) like Nagasaki. It was almost a year of cleaning before the smell finally disappeared.",

Apparently it kills them quickly with little pain, and it's the method that is sanctioned by the IRB who handle questions of ethics and such. Hope this helps in case there is a next time!",

When he was moving after college, his roommate had a fish tank. They needed to drive a couple of hours back home and decided to put the fish in a cooler with plenty of water. There wasn\u2019t space in the car, so they attached it to the hitch shelf on the back with some straps. Just before they left, my hubby thought they looked a little scared, so he put a few of their decorative rock hiding spots in there for them. \n\nYou see where this is going\u2026.\nWhen they arrived, my hubby opened the cooler to a fish milk shake. He stood there, so confused because they just seemed to cease to exist. When he realized what he had done, he felt much like you did the moment that bag hit the floor. \n\nMany years later, we like to joke about what the fish must have been thinking as every turn became a Squid Game episode. \n\nRIP little fishies.",

This reduces sloshing around which reduces stress and injuries. The main issue is transporting them fast to get them out the small amount of water before they foul it too much as that can also kill them. Fish are very delicate pets.",

It also seems cruel though - like, I doubt you're going to freeze it *in water*, so already, it's gasping for water, and then slowly being frozen (unless people do freeze it in water... but there is still the whole concept of freezing to death). I assume it doesn't feel quite the same to a fish, but idk. And there are cases where fish can be frozen, and all that happens is their metabolism slows way down, and they don't actually die, and can \"come back\" after being thawed, so idk what the amount of time to ensure a proper death would be.",

We do euthanize zebrafish in lab animal sometimes by rapid immersion in near-freezing water but most places I've worked either used clove oil or buffered MS-222 for cold-tolerant fish. For Koi it's usually a blunt force trauma with a non-penetrating captive bolt followed by pithing.\n\nFreezing like that used to be considered acceptable for reptiles and amphibians but is now thought to be more painful than previously understood for since ice forms in their tissues but they can't move to demonstrate distress.",

You put the fish in a container/bucket with aquarium water in it, mix a bottle with several drops of clove oil and aquarium water until the water in the bottle is cloudy and pour it into the container/bucket. Give the fish a few minutes to breathe it in and when they stop moving check them for reflexes. If they reflexively move or \u201cgasp\u201d when you take them out of the water, put them back down and give it a couple more minutes. Repeat until the fish stops having reflexive movements. The exact amount of clove oil is based on the size of the fish, so you\u2019d have to look that up, but when using it for euthanasia you really can\u2019t have too much",

For example: hybrid striped bass left in MS222 (another anesthesia agent for fish) at 5x surgical levels for 30 mins. No opercular movements, no definitive heart beat on Doppler, no reflexes. They were then placed in fresh water for 30 mins and >80% completely woke up. Fish are very tolerant of low O2 in their blood. I recommend at least anesthesia with clove/MS222 followed by pithing (destroying the brain) while they're still anesthetized to be safe. Being a vet, I also opt for euthanasia solution into the heart as a third way. No need to risk one waking up if the goal is to make sure it's been euthanized fully.",

It sure as hell wouldn't be in AVMA guidelines, and my sincere guess would be that based on the way a much stronger alcohol than regular vodka (such as 90% ethanol) kills tissues to preserve them still takes a pretty significant amount of time. The fish probably begin to regain consciousness, especially if they aren't super deep from the clove oil, before anything would kill them. That's based off what I know of those compounds, but to be fair, I have always had MS222, access to devices for pithing, and euthasol (or KCl) when I've done aquatic animal euthanasia so I haven't had to think of this one before.",

It can also build up under the eyes and skin, eventually causing enough pressure to give the scales a pinecone appearance. It\u2019s basically just excess fluid that builds up due to organ failure.",

Southern Girl here too, its heartbreaking the way some people treat their animals.\n\nI use snap traps for mice and rats, glue seems really cruel and poison isn't safe for the enviroment. We lost our last two cats to poisoned mice that got into our house from the neighbors' poisoning.\n\nSo far so good with the snaps. They work instantly and I have not had any survivors I had to deal with. But most of our rodent control falls to my cat Tiger. He is a very enthusiastic hunter. (But weirdly has no interest in birds. He's almost entirely an indoor cat, but even when he goes out, he does not bother the birds. I have a photo someplace of a chickadee perched on him because he was sleeping in the plate feeder.)\n\nAlthough when my rat needed to be euthanized, I ended up letting a feeder breeder I knew do the job. I took her to the vet, and the vet was gonna inject her in the heart with no sedative or anything. I couldn't do that, I just couldn't. \n\nI took her home and was crying to my dad about it, the next day he packed us (me and Rat) up and we went to his friend's house. He'd set up his usual CO2 chamber he used for feeder rats, but made a hole I could put my arm through and taped it air tight. My rat laid on my hand while he started the gas flow and it was so peaceful. Like, she never struggled, she never seemed in pain, she laid in my palm and licked my thumb that way she always did, and after awhile she went to sleep. A bit after that I realized I couldn't feel her breathing anymore.\n\nWe waited like thirty minutes after that \"to be sure\" and the breeder put her in a match box and offered me two baby girl rats. I refused them, but my dad took them anyway. Turns out sometimes Father Knows Best, because I have no idea how I would have gotten through that without the \"little girls\" to love and care for.",

She deserved so much better.\n\nHer breeder mostly breeds mice and rats for feeding (although he weeds out particularly good natured ratlings and gives/sells them as pets) and was the one to help me put her down. He even made the chamber with an armhole (that I had to be duct taped into to make it air tight...) so I could hold her until the end.\n\nIt was very sad, but seemed incredibly peaceful. She didn't struggle or seem to suffer, she just curled up on my hand and fell asleep, then I felt her \"go\".\n\nIt hurt so bad. I loved that rat, and cancer is a bitch.",

A lot of what I\u2019m catching wouldn\u2019t be worth cleaning either if I wasn\u2019t catching 10-20 of them. I keep them in the live well, if I have dinner by the end of the day I keep them, otherwise I throw them back. As a side note, water may not hurt marine carpet, but it\u2019s a pain in the ass to clean and takes forever to dry. Never get carpet in a boat, it may dampen sound but it\u2019s definitely not worth the trouble. If I\u2019m fishing from the shore, I just crush their head with a rock or branch, it\u2019s a little brutal and I admit I feel kinda bad about it at times, but if you hit hard enough it crushes their brain which is almost as fast as spiking them. It\u2019s probably not the most humane hobby no matter how you do it, but the fact that I\u2019m eating them instead of mounting them on my wall makes me feel a little better about it\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve caught some flounder in orange beach a few times, for a relatively docile fish they put up a surprisingly good fight. I don\u2019t get to do it very often, but ocean fishing is a lot of fun. My substitute is to use 5-10 lb test, its not the same as a big ass fish, but at least it feels like a decent fight",

It's a shame, I like the taste of river fish far better than ocean, except for tuna and striper, maybe.\n\nBlunt force is very humane from what I call tell, they don't have complicated brains, seems they scramble pretty easy. Thinking about it, fish wouldn't need to be resistant to blunt impacts much in the water, that might be why it's easy.\n\nSome ocean fishers brain them too, but they're big fish so they have what's basically a billy club or tiny bat to do it.\n\nFlounder are fun from the shore - I think being along the bottom makes them able to resist and use the features to fight, when you're on a boat and pulling them straight up, it's like reeling in a door mat - heavy, but not active. On the shore, like you say, they can make you work for it. The lighter line also gives you better feel of the hook, which can be nice bottom fishing on the beach.",

I don\u2019t know enough about it to target specific fish, but I\u2019ve found usually using light line and live bait makes for a good time. I\u2019ve gotten lucky a few times and reeled in a stingray or small shark, a little nerve wracking to unhook but a hell of a fight. My favorite story, and one I might not even believe if it hadn\u2019t happened to me, was a stingray I caught in destin. We had a few lines out, and my dumb ass wasn\u2019t paying attention, all of a sudden one of the rods goes flying over the sea wall and disappears. My grandfather was a little annoyed that I lost one of his Penns, but we just brushed it off and kept fishing. About an hour later, I feel a bite and reel it in, only to find his rod on my line. I pulled it over the wall, and started cranking, expecting to find a tangled mess and an empty hook. I finally manage to get the line in, assuming the \u201cfight\u201d I had been feeling was trash, then I pulled a  3 foot stingray over the wall.",

My aunt once reeled in a 28\" striper on a little snapper rod, they weren't even running, no idea how that happened. It was delicious I even ate a couple strips as sashimi while cleaning it.\n\nThose little damn dogfish sandsharks fight like hell, they're tough as nails too so when you toss them back you don't feel so bad.\n\nI love the secondary stingray catch, that's amazing.

Probably messed me up a bit too. Fast-forward about 10 years to college. Riding in a car with a girl going to veterinary school. As we're nearing the on-ramp to the highway, she sees a pigeon that was fucked up, flopping around on the side of the road and what not. She pulls over and puts the poor guy in her trunk to see if she could do anything. She couldn't, bird was all broken up. So she and the other guy start talking about how to put it out of its misery--their best idea was to set it under the car tire and run it over. I said I could just pop its head off, she said really, I said sure and just picked it up and--pop. Their jaws fucking dropped. They couldn't believe it, thought I was terrible, and so on. They were cool after a bit, but it was definitely one of those moments when the brutality of my upbringing slammed headlong into the more sheltered sensibilities of my friends.",

The youngest of my cousins had a pet hamster. \n\nOne night it escaped its cage and proceeded to investigate the house (leaving evidence of his journey) and ending up in my Aunt and Uncle's bedroom. He then climbed up on the comforter and proceeded to merrily make his way up to my Aunt's thigh before she awoke, screamed in fright, and scooped up that poor little rodent. Then she turned and with all her might she threw it against the wall next to their bed. It exploded. It quite literally exploded and I'll leave the description of gore to your imagination. But it was bad. \n\nMy Aunt's scream woke the whole house of course and I remember my poor cousin when he saw what had happened. \n\nFor the longest time that episode always came up at reunions and when I saw him last a few years ago I mentioned it. He smiled and admitted that memory would never leave him and whenever someone mentioned losing a pet he would say at least it didn't explode.",

Wait an hour. Check it and if the gills aren't moving wait another hour, then it should be good and dead. If the gills, or other parts are moving increase dosage and repeat. \n\nFreezing, adding alka seltzer, bashing it, reverse drowning it-- all of these are considered rather painful and inhumane for the fish.",

When you've cared for a fish for that long, they aren't \"just a fish\" like so many people see it to be. There are many species of fish that have a lot of personality and will grow familiar with their owners because they feed them on a daily basis. I had an irrubesco puffer that would come out from hiding whenever I walked by because she knew i would feed her and she was so comfortable around me that I could feed her by hand. It's hard *not* to grow attached to fish like that.\n\nMaybe consider using clove oil in the future. When administered appropriately, fish will lose consciousness and eventually stop breathing and die from hypoxia. You usually add the correct amount based on the size of the fish over a five minute period and then wait around 10 minutes until all signs of gill movement cease, then you can put the fish in the freezer if you want to be absolutely sure they pass.\n\nPhysical means are still valid so long as you are a competent fish handler or the fish is small enough that you could easily end things in one go without the risk of it somehow surviving. Your method actually wasn't bad in this case...you just should have used a stronger bag that wouldn't rip open in the process.",

To do this I put about a quarter cup of water in a water bottle with 15-20 drops of clove oil and shake vigorously u til it becomes cloudy. I put the fish in a small bowl of water and dump the clove oil/water emulsion in and it's asleep instantly. I flush it about ten minutes later. No mess, no trauma. Just sleep.

Like a cricket bat or night stick is what you need.  Just one good smack to the head, and it's dead in under a second.  While also preserving the body so you can eat it if it's a fish you caught like trout.\n\nWhen we were fishing in the Carribean, our captain would always buy some of the cheapest boxed rum he could get to bring on board.  As soon as we reeled in the fish and it was on our boat out of the water, he held open the fish's mouth, poured a bunch of rum down it's throat - in about 30 seconds the fish just straight passes out.  then one good smack to the head with a small cricket bat and that fish was gone.\n\nHonestly I thought it was a pretty good way to go; like imagine being the fish.  Suddenly you're out of water, and you can't breathe.  Within moments, you're shitfaced, and pass out - and that's it.\n\nHonestly, if you gotta kill me, that's the way I'd like to go.  Just get me so fucking drunk I can't help but black out completely and fall asleep.  Then bash my head in with one good whack.  Take my organs and use them, and feed my meat to hungry people.",

They'll go to sleep and die. This is the most humane method i've heard of.\n2. Put them in a bowl/container of their tank water, then put that in a larger container of ice cold water. The temperature of their water will gradually lower, they'll slow down, pass out and die painlessly. Putting them directly into freezing water causes them a lot of pain so that's not recommended at all.\n\nIt sucks, but it's a part of life some-times. I've had to euthanize a couple of fish, but I did my research before hand to find out what the best way to do it was.\n\nNext time you're unsure of something, save yourself the tifu and google different options!

I'd say that unless you're living in some cardboard box along the road anything under $100 would be justified for a living being you spent ~1/10 of your life with.

Depending on size of fish, add drops of clove oil to almost boiling water in a bucket, stir it around so the heated water will mix with the clove oil. Wait till water cools down then add the fish (20 min later) The fish will flip around when you remove it from its original home, but when you drop it in the bucket with clove oil it will take a breath and draw in the treated water into its gills instantly putting it to sleep forever. Leave it for 15 min. Then remove the fish to a bag and place in the freezer until garbage day.",

The cruelty can be intentional, such as kicking, burning, stabbing, beating, or shooting; or it can involve neglect, such as depriving an animal of water, shelter, food, and necessary medical treatment.\n\nAlso that wasnt just an animal, thats someones pet.  Op knew of the humane way of putting their pet down and instead chose to choose what is literally defined  as a cruel way to put your animal down.  Youre literally argueing between which one is less cruel.  When theyre both equally cruel and inhumane, what matters is he DOES IT HUMANELY.  HE LITERALLY GOOGLED IT, SAW THE ANSWER, SAID NAW IM GONNA GRAB A FUCKING BAG AND SMASH THIS FISH YOU LOVED INSTEAD OF DRIVING 15 MINUTES TO GET OIL TO PUT IT DOWN PAINLESSLY.  ALSO FISH STILL FEEL PAIN.  \nAnd to get ahead of it, yes fishermen slam fish against boat, thats a completely different situation that having a pet fish.",

Take 5 seconds and google how to humanely euthanize a pet fish and clove oil popls up since its a sedative.  The fish passes away peacefully, no pain at any point.  Not like fucking smashing it to bits it freezing it like you think are the only 2 ways to euthenize a fucking fish.  Im sick and tired of people who are arguing on the behalf of a human being who knew how to humanely put a fish down, choosing not to take the 20 minute drive to get the oil to put the pet fish down humanely, and instead deciding to smash it to fucking bits, something he hasnt done since he was 8.  Oh and was a completely different situation entirely.  The way he did it literally is animal abuse dipshit.  And if anyone did either of these to a human, they'd call that cruel too.  Please, never own an animal again for their safety.",

Occasionally, they would die on their own in the tub, or they would be on the verge of death, hardly able to move, only had the strength to chirp. Managers policy was if the chick wasn't dead yet, we could either put it in a grocery bag and set it in the dumpster to die there, or put it out of it's misery if you didn't want to let it suffer. Well, being an animal lover I didn't want it to suffer, so my manager told me to put the dying chick in a bag, tie it shut, and hit it against the dumpster hard enough to kill it, or at least knock it out if not kill it. Never having done this before I took that as \"swing that motherfucker as hard as you can\", so I did just that, and ended up with baby chicken guts covering my arm and work clothes. Probably the most traumatic experience I've ever had, still get chills thinking about it today.",

Definitely do your research on how to use clove oil, you don't want it to be too concentrated or to throw out a fish who is only asleep or something. But done properly, the fish sedates, then passes away while unconscious.   \n\n\nAnd while on the topic, do not try and euthanize a fish by freezing them!",

I felt terrible knowing the fish was gonna die while I did this and probably rip off its jaw so I used the fishing line to spin it really fast and smash it against the dock to end its suffering. It totally worked and the fish was dead no longer being tortured. \n\nHowever. The little girl watching me from the start of the dock saw me do this and had a look of horror on her face. Like I did what the hulk did to Loki to that fish and a little girl saw it and was not pleased.\n\n34 and to this day I still feel bad about it. I don't like killing things.",

      "text": "This reminds me of the time I decided, in a very drunken/high state, to throw my large deceased goldfish a Viking funeral. \n\nYa know, when you set them on a raft, light them on fire, and push them out to sea.\n\nOnly thing was: I had just broken my foot, like 2 days before my fish died, and I was still in a lot of pain and there was no way I was going to go find a body of water. So when he died, I obviously decided to pair my prescription painkillers with some cheap white wine I\u2019d bought from the store below (as a toast to my dearly departed friend).\n\nAlso: I had *just* moved into \u201cmy\u201d new place: a tiny (10x10ft) room in an SRO in Chinatown (shared bathrooms and kitchens). I had broken my foot the day that I had moved in. And just to set the scene a little more\u2026 \n\nThis building is packed with people. It\u2019s always bustling in the hallways. This is in the heart of SF\u2019s Chinatown. I was the only white person on my floor and maybe one of a small handful on the entire building. The majority of the people living there spoke only Chinese or very broken English. So that is to say: I stuck out like a sore thumb. Add a broken foot and set of crutches to it and, well, yeah.\n\nSo in my tiny little room I had a tiny little sink and a tiny little closet and a window. \n\nSo, in the throws of my grief .. my head buzzing from the magical combination of Vicodin and wine\u2026 I had the bright idea to wrap my fish in a bunch of newspaper and light him on fire in my sink where I would wash his ashes down the drain. \n\nThe fire alarm for the entire floor (40+ people?) went off about 20 seconds after setting the newspaper on fire. It was a fucking catastrophe. Black smoke billowing out of my tiny little room because of the various papers I\u2019d used. The window was open but it didn\u2019t matter. That room was so small it filled with smoke so fast. The smell wasn\u2019t TOO bad because thankfully it had barely seared the flesh before I\u2019d turned the sink on to put out the flames. \n\nSo of course I have to open my door up to get the air moving to get the smoke out so the alarm would shut off. And this wasn\u2019t just a smoke detector.. you know those crazy loud alarms the have in school buildings? Now imagine that sound in a tiny little room. *Absolutely deafening.* \n\nI still miss that place. I got to know some of the  folks on my floor pretty well, and absolutely loved living in their world. Those were some of the kindest people I\u2019ve ever met.",

The one, very pregnant female.\n\nI ended up with over a hundred of these damn mosquito fish, and I had them for about a year in total. There were up to sixty all at once, and believe it or not, they all had distinct personalities.\n\nThere was the one with the orange spot on his tail, who was super aggressive, and kind of a dick. There were shy ones, there were ones who would watch me when I was around, it was crazy.\n\nI actually connected to those damn fish. I would actually come home from school, and go straight to the bowl, and feed and talk to my fish.\n\nI dunno. I guess there was both the novelty of being the one kid who got a female, and therefore several more generations of waterfolk, and the fact that I\u2019d never had a pet until then\u2026 but yeah. I can actually understand how people can get attached to fish. \n\nOnce they all died off, I honestly missed them.",

You did it right if the fish 'jitters' and seizes up, and when the eye reflex (the fish turning its eyes towards the belly when layed on its side) stops. For a fish smaller than your forearm, there's surprisingly little force necessary; the spine of a knife is sufficient. But as long as the anesthetic doesn't create any distress like suffocation it's probably the better way for a lab, since you have to handle the fish less and you can probably also just knock out a whole tank full at once with the right dose. Electrocuting the fish is also an interesting solution to me, as it would be a viable option for commercial fishing to replace ice slurry or just letting the fish suffocate, which can take hours for cold water fish.",

So yeah blunt force trauma probably was the way to go in your situation, but murphys law I guess lol)\n\nIdk if anyone has said this yet but for future reference op, (obligatory not a vet or anything, just watch a lot of fish videos) clove oil is great for euthanizing fish. Its basically a fish anesthetic and an overdose puts them to sleep and they pass, quite like how they euthanize dogs and cats. Not that blunt force isn't another valid method, its just more... peaceful with clove oil lol Though maybe you found clove oil in your research and decided against it and it's not my buisness what you decide. Just thought I'd offer what I know.\n\n[Heres a link](https://youtu.be/W62VYkeRFm0) to a video by Luke's Goldies about this. Maybe don't show it to your girlfriend right now as shes probably still emotionally raw, but its good knowledge to have for future reference.",
