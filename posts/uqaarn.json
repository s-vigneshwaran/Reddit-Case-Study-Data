Listen to talk radio and occasionally watch Fox just to know the details of whatever dumb shit my right wing family decides to say today.\n\nUnfortunately, even if they repeat Tucker Carlson *word* *for* *word* they would just deny it when called out. \"Nuh uh, I dont watch whoever, its just commone sense!\" Even though I've literally watched whoever with them.\n\nTurns out you cannot argue with someone who has no sense of honesty and the overwhelming desire to \"win\" any argument.

                              "text": "Hello, is this Pizza Hut?\n\nExcellent. My name is Ben Shapiro. Conservative thought leader. Prominent white YouTuber. The Muggsy Bogues of the intellectual dark Web. And\u2014look, it\u2019s just a fact\u2014I would like to order some pizza pie. If you are triggered by that request, I do not care. I truly do not.\n\nNow let\u2019s discuss conditions. First, thank you for agreeing to debate me. Typically, in fora such as this, I am met with ad-hominem mudslinging, anything from \u201cYou racist creep\u201d or \u201cIs that your real voice?\u201d to raucous schoolyard laughter and threats of the dreaded \u201ctoilet swirly.\u201d However, your willingness to engage with me over the phone on the subject of pizza shows an intellectual fortitude and openness to dangerous ideas which reflects highly on your character. \n\nHuzzah, good sir. Huzzah.\n\nSecond, any pizza I order will be male. None of this \u201cOur pizza identifies as trans-fluid-pan-poly\u201d\u2014no. Pizza is a boy. With a penis. It\u2019s that simple. It\u2019s been true for all of human history, from Plato to Socrates to Mr. Mistoffelees, and any attempt to rewrite the pillars of Western thought will be met with a hearty \u201cFuh!\u201d by yours truly. And, trust me, that is not a fate you wish to meet.\n\nNow. With regard to my topping preference. I have eaten from your pizzeria in times past, and it must be said: your pepperoni is embarrassingly spicy. Frankly, it boggles the mind. I mean, what kind of drugs are you inhaling over there? Pot?! One bite of that stuff and I had to take a shower. So tread lightly when it comes to spice, my good man. You do not want to see me at my most epic. Like the great white hero of Zack Snyder\u2019s classic film \u201c300,\u201d I will kick you.\nOnions, peppers\u2014no, thank you. If I wanted veggies, I\u2019d go to a salad bar. I\u2019m not some sort of vegan, Cory Booker weirdo. And your efforts to Michelle Obama-ize the great American pizza pie are, frankly, hilarious. Though not as funny as the impressively named P\u2019Zone\u2014when I finally figured out that genuinely creative pun, I laughed until I cried and peed. A true Spartan admits defeat, and I must admit that, in this instance, your Hut humor slayed me, Dennis Miller style.\nAnd, with that, you have earned my order. Congratulations. Ahem. Without further ado, I would like your smallest child pizza, no sauce, extra cheese. \n\nHello? Aha. A hang-up. Another triggered lib, bested by logic. Damn it. I\u2019m fucking starving.",

They came to beleive that viruses didnt exist. They made up a therory that all sickness (cancer, common cold, diebeitys, ebola, you name it) was caused by oxidents overcharging atoms within cells and that cell service stimulated this reaction.  They beleive that the vaccine was %75 graphene (a huge oxident) as well as %60 polyethylene glycol (i know polyethylene glycol is real im just pointing out the math).I stole my health card and snuck out of the house to get my vaccine. After my parents found out i wasnt allowed to hold my baby brother for months because i was \"contaminated\". \n\nSo why dont people crack down on this misinformation to stop the spread of it? The reason is because misinformation is like drugs. If you try to keep people away from it they will grow curious. They will wonder what they dont see covered on the news and become untrusting. They will resort to the dark web and consume themselfs with misinformation thinking that \"this is what the government is hiding from me\". The better alternitive is to deregulate truth. Allow people to debate facts in public where they can see truth and lies side by side. They will realize just how stupid the fake news looks when compared to the truth. They will feel more open to discuss their fake facts with smart people who can guide them on the right path. \n\nThe morale of the story is that regulation usually backfires \n\nSorry for the bad grammer and spelling",

It's called the \"Lost Cause of the Confederacy.\" A couple decades after the Civil War, the South pretty much wrote its own history of what happened, and they started passing the racist Jim Crow laws to destroy the rights that blacks had gained. They glorified the Confederacy with songs and stories and displayed the Confederate battle flag. Many of the statues of Confederate leaders were built in the 1950s and 60s.\n\nThe Smithsonian's National Museum of African-American History and Culture in Washington, DC, tries to tell the tale of slavery, oppression, and racism toward black Americans (as well as their accomplishments and triumphs), but it is nothing like going to a concentration camp or Holocaust museum. I also went to Dachau, and my God, I never want to go there again. But I recognize that I needed to see it, to more closely understand the pain that millions of people went through.",

If the \"conservative\" opinion is truly the mass majority opinion?\n\nClearly the tactic of committing a mass shooting (against targets that are *always* definable as enemies of conservatives) as a false flag isn't working to shake the faith of conservatives. As a group, they double down even harder on their core beliefs after every single shooting. And it doesn't matter if the left believes the shooter is part of their in-group because that shooter reached their goal of hurting the credibility of conservatives.\n\nIf the left actually adopted their tactics and were actually going to commit a false flag, wouldn't it make a lot more sense to attack a target that's important to the conservative image? Say a politician or any symbol of whitehood? Those same lefties could claim that they were conservatives - the left and the conservatives would both believe they're domestic terrorists except the left gains an advantage of strengthening their narrative while also executing political enemies. That'd be so much more effective because it would actually strike true fear in the hearts of conservatives than someone shooting up a mosque or temple. It would send the message that they're being targeted in the open. It would be a black and white declaration who exactly the intended victims are supposed to be.\n\nOh no, wait. They think that it's possible for the left to be so incompetent at planting a false flag while also suppressing their every voice unilaterally despite being a very small percentage of the real population.\n\nJust kidding.

You might say that the risk of dying from a vending machine falling into you is \u201cstaggeringly higher\u201d than from a shark attack, but both events are astronomically rare, far under one in a million, and the phrasing ignores that nuance and suggests the first phenomenon is common.\n\nGetting into actual statistics on this subject might be counterproductive because the total number of people who fall victim to right-wing violence across the country is tiny, under 50 for 2019 according to the FBI, which is much, much smaller than the murder incidence in any sizable city.

There\u2019s also other major problems with the WHI, but CICO is based on this kind of research so if you support the CICO worldview, in general you should accept this kind of data gathering.\n\nContest that with something like Christopher Gardner\u2019s A to Z study, which imposed no energy restriction guidelines on participants but simply focused on whatever whole foods people preferred that fit into their dietary cohort (low fat or low carb). Lo and behold, the low-fat group had -5.3kg mean weight loss and the low-carb group -6.0kg. Everyone lost a bunch of weight of their own accord (both groups spontaneously reported 500-600kcal/d energy reductions), and had a laundry list of improved biomarkers, and the only real intervention was cutting out processed foods.",

If you somehow don't think that's true, you clearly haven't read his manifesto which lays that out extremely clearly. That's why he drove multiple hours to go to a predominantly black neighborhood to shoot almost exclusively black people. This isn't some little phrase that they both happened to say that is tenuously connecting them, this is his key ideology. \n\nAnd it's an ideology that is clearly inherently racist, dangerous and nonsense and should be a fringe extremist ideology nowhere near the mainstream for most impressionable 18 year olds to be picking up on. But the host of the most watched news channel in the USA has openly endorsed and broadcast it repeatedly, moving it well into mainstream discourse. \n\nCarson said the Biden administration was trying \u201cto change the racial mix of the country\". \"In political terms, this policy is called \u2018the great replacement\u2019, the replacement of legacy Americans with more obedient people from far-away countries\".\n\nCarlson has also in the above video denied the data-backed conclusions that right wing terrorism even exists, yet alone is the biggest terrorist threat on US soil. So when an 18 year old kid picks up a gun and massacres black people spouting Great Replacement theory, you can see why a spotlight is being shone on his actions and views.",

Last week out of nowhere we had to reach out to Police Departments, Fire department\u2019s, etc\u2026 because his administration had now removed that as a National priority.

                      "text": "No, despite the name (names are just labels and can't always determine if the content corresponds to the label, cf. DPRK), and here's why.\n\nFirst of all, here's Hitler's understanding of socialism from his 22.07.1922 speech \"Freistaat oder Sklaventum\" (translation from Shirer, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich):\n\nWhoever is prepared to make the national cause his own to such an extent that he knows no higher ideal than the welfare of the nation; whoever has understood our great national anthem, \u201cDeutschland ueber Alles,\u201d to mean that nothing in the wide world surpasses in his eyes this Germany, people and land - that man is a Socialist.\n\nThat is simply not how socialism is defined, therefore appealing to the mere use of the term is not an argument.\n\nEarly on there was an actual socialist wing in the NSDAP led by the Strasser brothers (e. g. Goebbels initially belonged to that wing).\n\nIn the winter of 1925/6 there was an internal debate in the party on the question of the compensation of the property expropriated from the former ruling royal houses. The Strasserite wing wanted the party to jump on the expropriation without compensation bandwagon. Hitler was strictly against this. At the Bamberg conference of 1926 Hitler's position as the absolute authority in the party was confirmed and the socialist wing lost on this issue, and, consequently, their overall influence was significantly reduced. They continued their activities for some time.\n\nIn Otto Strasser's Hitler and I (1940) he recounts a discussion with Hitler from 1930 (he published the transcript shortly after the talk and republished it in later books):\n\nhttps://archive.org/details/HitlerAndIOttoStrasser\n\nAdolf Hitler stiffened. \u2018Do you deny that I am the creator of National-Socialism?\u2019\n\u2018I have no choice but to do so. National-Socialism is  an idea born of the times in which we live. It is in the  hearts of millions of men, and it is incarnated in you.  The simultaneity with which it arose in so many minds  proves its historical necessity, and proves, too, that the  age of capitalism is over.\u2019\nAt this Hitler launched into a long tirade in which he  tried to prove to me that capitalism did not exist, that  the idea of Autarkie was nothing but madness, that the  European Nordic race must organize world commerce  on a barter basis, and finally that nationalization, or in Hitler and I socialization, as I understood it, was nothing but dilettantism, not to say Bolshevism.\nLet us note that the socialization or nationalization  of property was the thirteenth point of Hitler\u2019s official  programme.\n\u2018Let us assume, Herr Hitler, that you came into  power tomorrow. What would you do about Krupp\u2019s?  Would you leave it alone or not?\u2019\n\u2018Of course I should leave it alone,\u2019 cried Hitler. \u2018Do  you think me crazy enough to want to ruin Germany\u2019s  great industry?\u2019\n\u2018If you wish to preserve the capitalist regime, Herr  Hitler, you have no right to talk of socialism. For our  supporters are socialists, and your programme demands  the socialization of private enterprise.\u2019\n\u2018That word \u201csocialism\u201d is the trouble,\u2019 said Hitler.  He shrugged his shoulders, appeared to reflect for a  moment, and then went on:   \u2018I have never said that all enterprises should be  socialized. On the contrary, I have maintained that we  might socialize enterprises prejudicial to the interests  of the nation. Unless they were so guilty, I should consider it a crime to destroy essential elements in our  economic life. Take Italian Fascism. Our National-Socialist State, like the Fascist State, will safeguard  both employers\u2019 and workers\u2019 interests while reserving  the right of arbitration in case of dispute.\u2019\n\u2018But under Fascism the problem of labour and capital  remains unsolved. It has not even been tackled. It has  merely been temporarily stifled. Capitalism has remained intact, just as you yourself propose to leave it  intact.\u2019\n\u2018Herr Strasser,\u2019 said Hitler, exasperated by my answers, \u2018there is only one economic system, and that is  responsibility and authority on the part of directors and  executives. I ask Herr Amann to be responsible to me  for the work of his subordinates and to exercise his authority over them. There Amann asks his office manager  to be responsible for his typists and to exercise his authority over them; and so on to the lowest rung of the  ladder. That is how it has been for thousands of years,  and that is how it will always be.\u2019\n\nShortly after this Otto Strasser left the party and published his manifesto \"The socialists are leaving the NSDAP\": https://www.ns-archiv.de/nsdap/sozialisten/sozialisten-verlassen-nsdap.php\n\nGregor remained in the party but continued losing influence at a catastrophic rate, until he and the remaining part of the socialist wing were purged during the Night of the Long Knives in 1934. From time to time the leading Nazis did use the word \"socialist\" after that, which however by that time was empty of meaning, a zombie-word if you will.\n\nSo, in the end, the NSDAP under Hitler neither abolished the private ownership of the means of production, nor did it even plan to, which, by definition, made it a non-socialist party.\n\nThere's been one other argument, that since the Nazi regime was a dictatorship, all the private property was de facto abolished. Let's ignore for the moment that it still wouldn't make the party or the state socialist (since socialism doesn't imply only the abolition of the private means of production but also the workers' direct or indirect control over it, which would be impossible here), the thesis is not even correct, since in the Nazi Germany, with a few exceptions, the private property of the German citizens was respected, the private firms had a choice whether to work with the state and could dictate their conditions (the firm Topf und S\u00f6hne, the constructors of the crematoria and the gas chambers come to mind, whose sometimes heated correspondence with the SS is available). On this see Christoph Buchheim and Jonas Scherner, \"The Role of Private Property in the Nazi Economy: The Case of Industry\", The Journal of Economic History, 2006, vol. 66, issue 02, 390-416, https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/90cb/f391bd67a277087be05349347de3b582b1a3.pdf",

In Marxist theory, socialism refers to a specific stage of social and economic development that will displace capitalism, characterized by coordinated production, public or cooperative ownership of capital, diminishing class conflict and inequalities that spawn from such and the end of wage-labor with a method of compensation based on the principle of \"From each according to his ability, to each according to his contribution\".\\[34\\]\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>a political and economic system in which property and the means of production are owned in common, either through the state apparatus or through independent cooperatives\n\nThis accurately describes Mussolini's proletariat of the productive working class.

Hell, it\u2019s even difficult to find in China.\n\n>\t\u2018A law of 1923 supposedly limited the normal working hours in all occupations to eight a day or 48 a week. Yet this law was so qualified that employers, especially in agriculture, may prolong the working day beyond the nominal limit without being bound to pay overtime wages. Thus, during the summer months when work is at its heaviest and the only time when some workers can find employment laborers may be required to work ten hours a day without extra compensation. Also, violations of the wage and hours provisions of labor contracts are very numerous. Evidence of this is to be found in the many complaints made by individual workers to the syndical authorities, and in guarded comments in the press.\u2019\n\n[(source)](https://archive.org/details/corporatestatein010773mbp/page/n97/mode/1up?view=theater)\n\nFascists love using leftist rhetoric. Especially back then. For example, worker representatives in industry sound nice until you realize that they only recognized company unions (aka yellow unions). The workers didn't get to organize themselves, the capitalist had control.\n\nUniversal suffrage, however they got around that by taking away citizenship from groups and individuals they persecuted. If you aren't a citizen, you can't vote regardless of \"universal\" suffrage.\n\nAn 8 hour working day, unless you were in prison or a concentration camp. Then you were treated as a slave.\n\nFascism treats the \"in group\" well by exploiting marginalized groups extra hard. It operates on the same principles as social democracy except that while social democracy focuses on exploiting other nations, fascism tends to focus on first colonizing groups internally before spreading outwards. It also focuses on direct conquest more than economic conquest like social democracy.\n\nThis is why MLs call social democracy social fascism or the moderate wing of fascism. They operate on mostly the same principles.\n\nAt the beginning nazi and fascist movements actually had social policies in their programs. That's because the communists were really close to make a revolution just like in Russia, so they had to address the needs of people.\n\nBut after the first years, when they made an alliance with the bourgeoisie and the capitalist class, they purged all people with left tendencies (like in the Night of the Long Knives).\n\nA modern day example of the right using the language of the left for their own purposes (I.e. strengthen capitalism and it's benefactors).\n\nhttps://www.commondreams.org/views/2021/07/18/josh-hawley-throws-challenge-big-tech-and-left\n\n\n\n>State control of the economy is socialism, like the USSR and Nazi Germany.\n\nWhich leads to the absurd conclusion that absolute monarchies are also socialism.\n\nThe most basic needed factor in socialism is equality. Without it, it doesn\u2019t exist. So when a country nationalizes the economy, and then executes the jews, it can\u2019t be socialism, because it\u2019s lacks it\u2019s key component: equality.\n\nAlso another fun fact, Hitler explicitly stated he added socialism to the name of National Socialism to steal the worker votes of the communist. 100 years after the fact, you\u2019re still falling for *nazi propaganda*. Bravo.\n\n>\tHowever, the assumption that because the word \u201csocialist\u201d appeared in the party\u2019s name and socialist words and ideas popped up in the writings and speeches of top Nazis then the Nazis must have been actual socialists is naive and ahistorical. What the evidence shows, on the contrary, is that Nazi Party leaders paid mere lip service to socialist ideals on the way to achieving their one true goal: raw, totalitarian power.\n\n>\t[Hitler] was wholly ignorant of any formal understanding of the principles of economics. For him, as he stated to the industrialists, economics was of secondary importance, entirely subordinated to politics. His crude social-Darwinism dictated his approach to the economy, as it did his entire political \u201cworld-view.\u201d Since struggle among nations would be decisive for future survival, Germany\u2019s economy had to be subordinated to the preparation, then carrying out, of this struggle. This meant that liberal ideas of economic competition had to be replaced by the subjection of the economy to the dictates of the national interest. Similarly, any \u201csocialist\u201d ideas in the Nazi programme had to follow the same dictates. Hitler was never a socialist. But although he upheld private property, individual entrepreneurship, and economic competition, and disapproved of trade unions and workers\u2019 interference in the freedom of owners and managers to run their concerns, the state, not the market, would determine the shape of economic development. Capitalism was, therefore, left in place. But in operation it was turned into an adjunct of the state.\n\nFor members of the Nazi Party, in fact, defending socialism on its own terms was a risky activity which could result in ejection from the party, or worse.\n\n>\tUnfortunately for him, he had taken seriously not only the word \u201csocialist\u201d but the word \u201cworkers\u201d in the party\u2019s official name of National Socialist German Workers\u2019 Party. He had supported certain strikes of the socialist trade unions and demanded that the party come out for nationalization of industry. This of course was heresy to Hitler, who accused Otto Strasser of professing the cardinal sins of \u201cdemocracy and liberalism.\u201d On May 21 and 22, 1930, the Fuehrer had a showdown with his rebellious subordinate and demanded complete submission. When Otto refused, he was booted out of the party.\n\n>\tThis ideology took a leftist label chiefly for tactical reasons. It demanded, within the party and within the state, a powerful system of rule that would exercise unchallenged leadership over the \u201cgreat mass of the anonymous.\u201d And whatever premises the party may have started with, by 1930 Hitler\u2019s party was \u201csocialist\u201d only to take advantage of the emotional value of the word, and a \u201cworkers\u2019 party\u201d in order to lure the most energetic social force. As with Hitler\u2019s protestations of belief in tradition, in conservative values, or in Christianity, the socialist slogans were merely movable ideological props to serve as camouflage and confuse the enemy.\n\nDespite continuing certain Weimar-era social welfare programs, the Nazis proceeded to restrict their availability to \u201cracially worthy\u201d (non-Jewish) beneficiaries. In terms of labor, worker strikes were outlawed. \n\nTrade unions were replaced by the party-controlled German Labor Front, primarily tasked with increasing productivity, not protecting workers. In lieu of the socialist ideal of an egalitarian, worker-run state, the National Socialists erected a party-run police state whose governing structure was anti-democratic, rigidly hierarchical, and militaristic in nature. \n\nAs to the redistribution of wealth, the socialist ideal \u201cFrom each according to his ability, to each according to his need\u201d was rejected in favor of a credo more on the order of \u201cTake everything that belongs to non-Aryans and keep it for the master race.\u201d",

No one is defending their actions as thinly veiled racist undertones. But you have people like Arbitor gays who murdered people but is now paraded through rallies, caught with pictorial evidence flashing white supremacy signs. So to answer your question: people aren\u2019t outraged because justice has been served for those particular crimes which is just another example of white privilege.

Of the 24,000+ deaths from homicide in the US each year, 97 deaths (2020, highest on record) of right wing terrorism is a drop in the bucket. Now, where he is really off is in the false assumption in this quote:\n\n>The narrative being pushed is that white supremacy poses the greatest risk to this nation\n\nAll of the news articles referencing white nationalist terrorism point to the fact that they top THE TERRORISM THREAT and not to them being the greatest threat to the nation.\n\nThis is a common tactic in propaganda and is called the straw man fallacy.  The propaganda states \"those in opposition are saying this is the biggest threat to the nation!\" That is patently untrue.  Nobody except Fox and Friends is saying that.  However, those that listen think that is the narrative being pushed and without looking it up fail to realize that IS NOT the narrative.\n\nWhat intrigues me the most is that you ALSO believe the propaganda that this is the greatest threat to the nation.  In doing so you position yourself just as incorrectly as they did in stating it.",

One often result in destruction of property and throwing stuff at police, the other include arming and putting themselves in risk of killing people or even with intent of killing people.\n\nKeep in mind, I live in Norway with an outside perspective. I know about Maddow and her twisting of things, and I know about fox and tucker. I really don't like Maddow, msnbc nor CNN. It's trash nowadays. But Fox is a dangerous propaganda machine with the sole aim of controlling and using people for their own benefits. I encourage you to look up the history of why fox News even started. Hint, mostly to enrich themselves. CNN started as legit news but is desperate to stay in business. A bit different agendas so to speak.",

There is literally evidence that says people are capable of getting firearms other ways other than legally.\n\nPlease name one because law enforcement are one of the occupations that need them.

The two mass shooting i can think of that had a liberal/leftist perpetrate it didn\u2019t do so for any political reasoning. Whereas in the 2010\u2019s we had quite a few mass shootings that were explicitly motivated by conservative ideology, and a lot more that were done by a conservative shooter whether or not the shooting was specifically for conservative ideology. Kinda weird how one political leaning seems to comprise all motivation for politically driven mass shootings and seems to be significantly more tied in with mass shooters huh?",

Discrimination and poverty unite them in the daily fight for survival but their different ways of approaching life separate them completely: The black is indolent and a dreamer; spending his meager wage on frivolity or drink; the European has a tradition of work and saving, which has pursued him as far as this corner of America and drives him to advance himself, even independently of his own individual aspirations.\"\n\nAnother comment came from Guevara\u2019s writing about his time fighting with revolutionaries in the Congo and included this line: \"Given the prevailing lack of discipline, it would have been impossible to use Congolese machine-gunners to defend the base from air attack: they did not know how to handle their weapons and did not want to learn.\"\n\nFinally, there\u2019s this line after the revolution in 1959: \"We're going to do for blacks exactly what blacks did for the revolution.

Their placement on the ultra-Right wing is artificial, unwarranted, and was done as a pure propagandistic measure during the acute internecine struggle among socialist currents. Nationalism is not a determining factor in the polarization of the political spectrum. Indeed, xenophobic ideas can be inherent in both Left and Right ideology. However, the dramatic history of the 20th century showed that overt and covert nationalism is instead inherent in the Left.\n\ndo any of you actually have substance or is this all just rhetoric",

Scholars of CRT view race as a social construct with no biological basis. One tenet of CRT is that racism and disparate racial outcomes are the result of complex, changing, and often subtle social and institutional dynamics, rather than explicit and intentional prejudices of individuals. CRT scholars argue that the social and legal construction of race advances the interests of White people at the expense of people of color, and that the liberal notion of U.S. law as \"neutral\" plays a significant role in maintaining a racially unjust social order, where formally color-blind laws continue to have racially discriminatory outcomes.  \nQUOTE:Critics charge that the theory leads to negative dynamics, such as a focus on group identity over universal, shared traits; divides people into \u201coppressed\u201d and \u201coppressor\u201d groups; and urges intolerance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is ONE race, human. Anyone who says otherwise is by definition a racist. That stated, it is bad because it is more harmful than good, if it actually has any good. For example, if you have read White Fragility or Ibram X. Kendi, you should know this to be true. Now, not all proponents of CRT agree with all or either of those, but those are the prevailing thoughts, and thus should be openly rejected.  \n\n\nIf you watch main stream media for like 30 minutes, you come across the 2nd quote dozens of times a day, so whether or not it is THE definition or not, it is what is touted, and thus should be rejected.",

From your own quote:\n\n>Scholars of CRT view race as a social construct with no biological basis\n\n/e\n\nBut there are a lot of racists out there.  Many held or currently hold positions of power. Just saying racism bad doesn't make them go away or hold less power.  Which is why we have schools of thought like CRT that analyzes laws and looks to see if any unfairly advantage or disadvantage various races or ethnicities.  That includes critically examining things like affirmative action legislation and seeing if they actually accomplish what they set out to do or if they are ineffective have unintended effects.\n\nWhile you may have some disagreements with the conclusions some people draw from CRT, if you discount CRT entirely you're throwing the baby out with the bathwater.\n\n>Critics charge that the theory leads to negative dynamics, such as a focus on group identity over universal, shared traits; divides people into \u201coppressed\u201d and \u201coppressor\u201d groups; and urges intolerance.\n\nWhich is an incorrect view of CRT. **Edit**:  Again, from your definition:\n\n>Scholars of CRT view race as a social construct with no biological basis\n\nHow can CRT urge intolerance or divide groups is doesn't believe exists into oppressed/oppressors?\n\n/e\n\n\n  CRT doesn't just examine laws written by racist people, it questions any laws that wind up targeting one racial/ethnic demographic over another, for better or worse, intentionally or unintentionally, which includes things like questioning affirmative action.  If you are criticizing affirmative action laws and questioning if they actually help the people they are supposed to or unfairly hurting others, congratulations, you are using CRT.",

You accuse CRT of being intolerant, when it anti-CRT people looking to silence CRT proponents, not the other way around.\n\nCRT agrees with you that races are a social construct.\n\nCRT agrees with you that affirmative action laws often cause more harm than good.\n\nWhat specific part of CRT is it that you find so evil.

He is very lucky that none of them died otherwise he would be facing murder charges on top of his terrorism charges. He did not shoot any black people. Are you seriously going to  claim that anything black does not get news coverage? That\u2019s interesting. The BLM protests last year were very heavily covered. So was Brionna Taylor, george Floyd, travon Martin, Oscar grant, philando Castile, Eric garner, Michael brown..(these are all just off the top of my head, there are many more). Most of the acclaimed athletes covered in the news are black. Several news anchors, pundits, reporters and hosts are black in news media. Black culture is heavily consumed by Americans in the form of food, music and films.  In the last 20 years we have had a black president, a black Vice President, a black secretary of defense, a black attorney general, a black Secretary of State and a black woman was just nominated and confirmed to the Supreme Court. What is black that is not being covered?  What am I lying about with any of my comments? You are definitely biased, uneducated and certainly full of shit to be sure.",

                  "text": "No, despite the name (names are just labels and can\u2019t always determine if the content corresponds to the label, cf. DPRK), and here\u2019s why.\n\nFirst of all, here\u2019s Hitler\u2019s understanding of socialism from his 22.07.1922 speech \u201cFreistaat oder Sklaventum\u201d (translation from Shirer, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich):\n\nWhoever is prepared to make the national cause his own to such an extent that he knows no higher ideal than the welfare of the nation; whoever has understood our great national anthem, \u201cDeutschland ueber Alles,\u201d to mean that nothing in the wide world surpasses in his eyes this Germany, people and land - that man is a Socialist.\n\nThat is simply not how socialism is defined, therefore appealing to the mere use of the term is not an argument.\n\nEarly on there was an actual socialist wing in the NSDAP led by the Strasser brothers (e. g. Goebbels initially belonged to that wing).\n\nIn the winter of 1925/6 there was an internal debate in the party on the question of the compensation of the property expropriated from the former ruling royal houses. The Strasserite wing wanted the party to jump on the expropriation without compensation bandwagon. Hitler was strictly against this. At the Bamberg conference of 1926 Hitler\u2019s position as the absolute authority in the party was confirmed and the socialist wing lost on this issue, and, consequently, their overall influence was significantly reduced. They continued their activities for some time.\n\nIn Otto Strasser\u2019s Hitler and I (1940) he recounts a discussion with Hitler from 1930 (he published the transcript shortly after the talk and republished it in later books):\n\nhttps://archive.org/details/HitlerAndIOttoStrasser\n\nAdolf Hitler stiffened. \u2018Do you deny that I am the creator of National-Socialism?\u2019\u2018I have no choice but to do so. National-Socialism is  an idea born of the times in which we live. It is in the  hearts of millions of men, and it is incarnated in you.  The simultaneity with which it arose in so many minds  proves its historical necessity, and proves, too, that the  age of capitalism is over.\u2019At this Hitler launched into a long tirade in which he  tried to prove to me that capitalism did not exist, that  the idea of Autarkie was nothing but madness, that the  European Nordic race must organize world commerce  on a barter basis, and finally that nationalization, or in Hitler and I socialization, as I understood it, was nothing but dilettantism, not to say Bolshevism.Let us note that the socialization or nationalization  of property was the thirteenth point of Hitler\u2019s official  programme.\u2018Let us assume, Herr Hitler, that you came into  power tomorrow. What would you do about Krupp\u2019s?  Would you leave it alone or not?\u2019\u2018Of course I should leave it alone,\u2019 cried Hitler. \u2018Do  you think me crazy enough to want to ruin Germany\u2019s  great industry?\u2019\u2018If you wish to preserve the capitalist regime, Herr  Hitler, you have no right to talk of socialism. For our  supporters are socialists, and your programme demands  the socialization of private enterprise.\u2019\u2018That word \u201csocialism\u201d is the trouble,\u2019 said Hitler.  He shrugged his shoulders, appeared to reflect for a  moment, and then went on:   \u2018I have never said that all enterprises should be  socialized. On the contrary, I have maintained that we  might socialize enterprises prejudicial to the interests  of the nation. Unless they were so guilty, I should consider it a crime to destroy essential elements in our  economic life. Take Italian Fascism. Our National-Socialist State, like the Fascist State, will safeguard  both employers\u2019 and workers\u2019 interests while reserving  the right of arbitration in case of dispute.\u2019\u2018But under Fascism the problem of labour and capital  remains unsolved. It has not even been tackled. It has  merely been temporarily stifled. Capitalism has remained intact, just as you yourself propose to leave it  intact.\u2019\u2018Herr Strasser,\u2019 said Hitler, exasperated by my answers, \u2018there is only one economic system, and that is  responsibility and authority on the part of directors and  executives. I ask Herr Amann to be responsible to me  for the work of his subordinates and to exercise his authority over them. There Amann asks his office manager  to be responsible for his typists and to exercise his authority over them; and so on to the lowest rung of the  ladder. That is how it has been for thousands of years,  and that is how it will always be.\u2019\n\nShortly after this Otto Strasser left the party and published his manifesto \u201cThe socialists are leaving the NSDAP\u201d: https://www.ns-archiv.de/nsdap/sozialisten/sozialisten-verlassen-nsdap.php\n\nGregor remained in the party but continued losing influence at a catastrophic rate, until he and the remaining part of the socialist wing were purged during the Night of the Long Knives in 1934. From time to time the leading Nazis did use the word \u201csocialist\u201d after that, which however by that time was empty of meaning, a zombie-word if you will.\n\nSo, in the end, the NSDAP under Hitler neither abolished the private ownership of the means of production, nor did it even plan to, which, by definition, made it a non-socialist party.\n\nThere\u2019s been one other argument, that since the Nazi regime was a dictatorship, all the private property was de facto abolished. Let\u2019s ignore for the moment that it still wouldn\u2019t make the party or the state socialist (since socialism doesn\u2019t imply only the abolition of the private means of production but also the workers\u2019 direct or indirect control over it, which would be impossible here), the thesis is not even correct, since in the Nazi Germany, with a few exceptions, the private property of the German citizens was respected, the private firms had a choice whether to work with the state and could dictate their conditions (the firm Topf und S\u00f6hne, the constructors of the crematoria and the gas chambers come to mind, whose sometimes heated correspondence with the SS is available). On this see Christoph Buchheim and Jonas Scherner, \u201cThe Role of Private Property in the Nazi Economy: The Case of Industry\u201d, The Journal of Economic History, 2006, vol. 66, issue 02, 390-416, https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/90cb/f391bd67a277087be05349347de3b582b1a3.pdf",
