The U in colour and armour were dropped because they are unnecessary holdovers from their French roots. So was the Germanic E in axe, and gray is spelled with an A rather than an E because that more accurately reflects how it's pronounced. It's nothing to do with advertising and everything to do with Enlightenment philosophy.",

Seximal can do forths about as well as decimal can do thirds, and decimal handles thirds just fine. (though fair cop, seximal is impressively garbage at elevenths, and both decimal and dozenal handle those fine, as youd expect for a number one away from their respective 10s)\n\nAnd yeah, dozenal represents numbers with less digits, but that in itself isn't a virtue, it comes at the tradeoff of complexity. After all, hexadecimal, sexagesimal, or bigger-number-imal hold far more data per digit, but they require knowing more numerals. Seximal does push it a bit with the low data per digit, but not too much IMO.",

I think you missed my point, which is not that you\u2019re a child, but that base 10 and base 12 are both equally easy to teach to a child because of the way that (most) humans are built. The reason most people think base 10 is the easiest to work with is because that\u2019s the one they learned first and are most comfortable with. If we had been born in ancient Babylon, we\u2019d be counting everything using base 12 and never thinking twice about it. It all depends on what you learned first.",

This gives math in base 60 several advantages to math in base 10, for example. For one, dividing by any of these numbers becomes much easier.\n\nFor that matter, 12 is a highly composite number too, which is why some people (me included) advocate for the adoption of a base 12 numeral system.

          "text": "It's bizarre to me this is even widespread enough to merit a Snopes write-up in the first place. It's also kind of interesting in that it debunks the causality asserted, but leaves room for correlation:\n\n>What we found, on the contrary, is that newspapers in early America typically charged advertisers according to the amount of space the copy took up...By the early 1800s, says Margaret A. Blanshard\u2019s History of the Mass Media in the United States (2013), newspapers had begun pricing their advertising space based on the number of lines an ad contained.\n\nSo while papers may not have charged by the letter, the number of letters could still affect the advertising cost. It's therefore plausible that Webster's changes were the underlying **cause,** *and* advertising costs were one **reason** some of his changes gained widespread acceptance. (It may also explain why some changes, like \"wimmen,\" weren't broadly adopted.) Ad writers may have embraced some of the shortened words to save a line from wrapping to the next one and raising the cost of their ad.\n\nThat doesn't mean it's true or provable, but I don't think there's enough information (at least in the Snopes article) to completely disprove it either. What it does disprove is the meme's implication that ad cost is *the* reason.",

Webster's spelling was only adopted because Worcester died an untimely death, so his dictionaries stopped being produced, and because peopled connected more with the nationalistic fervour that Webster's dictionaries stoked.",

International spelling consistently almost always follows etymology, so there are no or very few surprises at all. This is not to mention it hints at understanding the meaning of words easily (e.g., metre is the metric unit of length; meter is a measuring device. practice is the noun; practise is the verb).",
