If you ran your Ender 3 24 hours for the whole month, it would cost you around $11.\u201d\n\nA 3D printer, after running 24 hours for a whole month would average $11 in the US. Again this is a 3D printer.\n\nHe could leave the printer on an entire month of working there and the cost of the lost electricity wouldn\u2019t even amount to his hourly pay. Yes, in most situations I agree with you, but for this? \n\nUnless you work for a lemonade stand, this is likely a rounding error for most companies finances. This is just power tripping",

Sounds great, except that the printer was old, and had no proper way to notify users that it was asleep\n\n(not like my laser printer today which has 3 modes that it illustrates on the LCD as 'napping', 'sleeping' or 'deep sleep')\n\nInstead it would throw up an error message on the printer related to the Fuser, basically 'Fuser Error ###' where the ### was a code that when you looked it up meant 'the fuser heater is turned off'.\n\nMy boss, every damned time, would come look at the printer, see the message, then walk over to my office and tell me 'the printer isn't working', and every time by the time he got to my office it had actually finished waking up the fuser and printed at least the first page of his document.\n\nBeing the boss(*), he wasn't able to handle being told that the error message was normal, and if he'd just stand by the printer for 30 seconds, it would be working fine, and no I couldn't disable it because it was an intrinsic function of NeWSprint that he had insisted I upgrade to the latest version a few months earlier, and Sun offers no way to downgrade the license back to the old version so you're stuck with it, probably because the state mandates 'ECO friendly'.\n\n\n(*) He was actually someone famous in silicon valley who was a major code contributor to the history of the internet, he should have fucking known better.",

Therefore to deal with this letter sized paper its telling you to load some letter sized paper instead of this A4 paper.\n  Of course as an end user who didn't realise they even made a mistake, it's confusing as hell.\n  This issue usually comes about because the default settings is the US region and nobody has changed it. Most software these days will happily shrink documents to fit whatever the paper is, so it's less of an issue, old software was less forgiving.",

As an avid gamer that had to repeatedly set up a friend's living room entertainment system (because for some reason they kept unplugging stuff) I told him I can get it working today.  He insisted but I didn't listen.  \n\nI assembled the shelves and plugged everything in except power so it was ready to go.  Told him its all good, just plug it in.  Manager still said no, wait for the \"professional\" next week.......\n\nTwo months later the guy showed up and told my Manager \"It was already set up, I just had to plug it in\".  I gave a polite \"Told you so\" after Manager told me and admitted that he should have let me plug it in.  Don't know how much the \"professional's\" trip cost though.",

The nursing home by far had the worst shit happen. Here are a few stories:\n\nThe nursing home insisted they get mobile kiosks (a surface pro 3 attached to a rolly device). We told them they would not use it. Low and behold the PO came in for tons of em. Fast track 3 months later, I get a call about a broken charger adapter for one of the kiosks. I go onto the floor, they somehow ripped the fucking power cord out of the wall so hard, the god damn prongs were the only thing left in the wall, and was buzzing like crazy. Had to call building maintenance asap to rip it out. Had to kill the break and everything\u2026\n\nAnother story for ya. I took calls as well as did field work (terribly underpaid for what I did). I got a call from one of the nursing home floors about the wifi being down. I always ask, is it down for anyone else (the answer is always no). If you know anything about nurses, they dont do their own troubleshooting. If you tried to tell them to simply reconnect to the wifi on their laptop, they would throw a fit or say they already did that. So I got creative. I would tell them: \u201cok ma\u2019am. I made a change in the system real quick. Go ahead and try to connect to the wifi\u201d. Of course it fucking  worked almost every time. \n\nMoral of the story, IT are miracle workers.",

Why take the time to read the instructions and replace the printer ink yourself, or having your employees do it while they *should* be working, when you can just hire someone who\u2019s job it \u201cactually is\u201d to come do it.\n\nIt\u2019s very weird and convoluted, and likely just ends up costing more resources at the end of the day than intended. Someone could have read those instructions and replaced the cartridge in like 5 minutes probably. I wonder how long they waited, without a properly functioning printer, for the tech guy to come in and do it? \n\nProbably just lost more time, plus $200.",

Also, the blowing did nothing (at least) 99 times out of 100.\n\nThe mechanism of the NES was very inconsistent and it was *very* easy for all of the pins to not make proper contact. Taking the cartridge out and reinserting it, or even just disengaging and re-engaging the mechanism, was what resulted in a proper connection.\n\nIf the NES had been a regular top-loader like the Famicom or the Super NES/Famicom (or practically *any other cartridge-based console*), the cartridges would have worked significantly more often.

But unless their steps are destructive or they are charging me by the hour, I take a deep breath and follow their instructions.\n\nSO much of the time, honestly like the majority of the time, there's something small the user overlooks because they have no reason to believe it's out of place.\n\nA seemingly meaningless error message \"that's always been there\" or an apparently random error sound effect that isn't accompanied by a dialogue box, a really split second dialogue box, a double flashing of the screen, missing menu items, etc etc.\n\nYou may have already restarted, flushed the cache, mucked the stalls, done the updates, reinstalled, changed the headlight fluid, swapped the RAM and descaled the humidifier, but if either I didn't see it all or you didn't do it all while I was on the call listening to your clicking/typing and the sounds the computer was making, we could have missed something important.\n\nI can't tell you how many times that a user has left out information they didn't think was important and if I didn't catch it, the troubleshooting would have failed and it would have been frustrating for everyone.\n\nI have also had times where I was the impatient, crabby user who *knows all this stuff, ugh, just **trust me*** but relented to following the basic instructions and...oh. I missed that. I was too close to it. I stopped seeing it. So much of both our time was saved.\n\nAnd yes, I've also had very frustrating interactions where the support personnel were not actually knowledgeable or helpful and you never know who you're going to get because companies don't value those jobs enough to pay people to give a shit and be good at their job.\n\nRegardless, it's one of those things where I just find my zen and do the rudimentary beginner's steps even though I know what I know. That is how I prove to the tech that I'm not an idiot, and that's how we develop enough trust that she'll decide that I'm trustworthy enough to perform a troubleshooting step that would save time but normally can't be done on a call.\n\nThat kind of trust built also results in escalations that turn out to be helpful, should my problem genuinely be tricky. Most of the time the first person you talk to isn't going to be the one with the knowledge you need if you're presenting with a very complex issue. But if you work with them in spite of your frustration, they will be very quick to make sure your issue gets sent up the chain quickly and correctly so you get the help you actually need.\n\nDuring the entire interaction, we're making mental and sometimes literal notes about how well we trust you to follow instructions and provide accurate information about exactly what your technology is doing and what you're actually clicking and typing (if we can't see it - I got out before the remote tech). If we can be sure you're legit, then we'll try things that we wouldn't otherwise try with someone we suspect us lying to us or unwilling to work with us.\n\nSo yeah, I know it sucks sometimes. I do. I've had my fair share of shitty support interactions. But if you do get someone good, don't waste it by insisting we have to trust you without knowing you (therefore making you automatically sus) or by lying about following the steps. It's not worth it.",

But that means that _smart/stupid people_ assume that _everyone else_ is just as smart/stupid as they are. Its been a bitter lesson for me to learn that the vast majority of people are _not_ as smart as me, do not have a memory near as good as me, are not as well read as me, do not have as good reasoning abilities as me, etc. etc. etc.",

Jobs are not paid on the basis of \u201chow hard you work\u201d or any other metric you might deem \u201cmoral\u201d in nature. It\u2019s based on how many people can do your job to a satisfactory degree, and how much additional (estimated) money the company makes as a result of having you work for them. That\u2019s literally all there is to it. Supply and demand.\n\nThe whole thing about barrier to entry? Sure. I went to a bootcamp that cost me $3K for a six-week course. I took out a special loan specifically designed to pay for this type of educational expense. And then I spent a month or so looking for work until I found a job. They paid me $45K/year.\n\nThis is something that a lot of people can do. One of my classmates was a barista before he joined the bootcamp. Another was a waitress. The question is, do you actually enjoy doing the work? And are you good at it? And can you save up enough to afford 2 months off work? If you can\u2019t, then can you borrow the money? Because that\u2019s pretty much it.\n\nBTW, there is a massive shortage of software developers right now. They\u2019re giving out raises just to keep people around. If you want it, then become part of the supply, and meet the demand.\n\nAs for other jobs. Yeah. Raise the minimum wage. Everyone deserves a decent life. That means everyone. But that doesn\u2019t mean everyone should get paid the same. So stop blaming tech workers for problems that have absolutely nothing to do with them. If you\u2019re not getting paid enough, then that\u2019s a public policy problem that can be solved through good public policy.",

Our local voting machines have an old lcd display showing the pages of the ballot and, like, 30 big rubber buttons that line up on each side of the screen that you click next to the corresponding ballot item. \n\nHere is a picture example:\nhttps://verifiedvoting.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/MicroVote_Infinity_2.jpg\n\nI explain when I put voters in the booth to use the rubber buttons on each side (with a Vanna White wave) and then when they want to go to the next page, they hit that rubber button in the lower right. Some people don't listen and I wish the other judges would better emphasize the real buttons when they put the person in the booth because once they start voting we can't re-enter the booth to help. Most questions from voters are people who can't get to the next page.  It doesn't help that the program has the words 'next page' in a box that looks like a button you might find in a phone app. So even if they used the buttons to select their candidates, for some people they're brain resets to using a touch screen when they see that nice false 'next page' button at the bottom.\n\nWhen a voter inevitably calls us over, I tell them, \"This isn't a touch screen, are you hitting the dark grey button to the right of the words 'Next Page?'\" I usually have to say it twice before it registers, \"Remember this isn't a touch screen, you have to use the rubber buttons.\" \n\nThey hit the screen maybe two more times while we stand powerless 1 foot away until suddenly, \"Oh! I was pressing the screen!\" and I say, \"That's alright it happens a lot.\"\n\nBut this Tuesday I had a guy who kept insisting he was pressing the button and his machine was frozen no matter how I worded my explanation. So I asked him, \"What happens when you press the button ***right above*** the button for 'next page?'\" There is nothing on this screen above the false 'next page' button but there are those ~14 other identical grey buttons above the real next page button. I knew nothing would happen when he pressed it **BUT** by asking him to press it and tell me what happened, I forced him to find the column of real buttons slightly to the right. Suddenly he went, \"Oh now I get it!\" and we were golden.\n\nI thank a gig I had a decade ago that included phone support for a browser app for knowing you have to trick users into listening to your instructions and break their mental narrative rut.",

Find for office work, but not able to do 3d graphics.  \n\n\nThe one on the dedicated card will have it's own super fast ram, 3d processors, very powerful in comparison. etc.  \n\n\nIn certain situations you can shunt the output from the add on card through the motherboard hdmi port, but you'd get better performance though the cards own ports.  \n\n\nIf manufactures are doing their job, they'll put a plug in the motherboard one when they add a discreet GPU.  \n\n\nSome people don't pay attention and put the hdmi cable into the motherboard port then never understand why they can't run decent games that their card should be able to play.   \n\n\nAnother problem similar to this, is there are a lot of laptops out there that have 2 GPUs too. One very low power for desktop apps and office stuff, then one high powered GPU for games, but the nvidia software is very very stupid so it will divert high powered games to the low powered one instead of the high powered one and you have to go in and manually specify that you want each game to run on the high powered GPU.",

The motherboard didn't actually have any connections for an external power source, so the two aren't connected inside.\n\nIt worked great for years, and eventually I decided to upgrade its old spinning hard drive to an SSD.  When I put it back together, I plugged the power into the input on the case, and than panicked when it didn't boot. \n\nI thought I must have fried it somehow -- static or something.  I spent two days trying to nurse it back to health.  Finally I called in a friend.  He looked at it, pointed at the power input on the motherboard and said: \"What's that?\"\n\nSure enough, it booted up great just as soon as I plugged the power into the correct input.  It was simultaneously a great relief and I felt like a complete numpty.\n\nI doubt I'll ever forget that again, but just in case I covered the useless power input with some duct tape and wrote an X on it with sharpie.",

Like the earliest pong video games and first VCR\u2019s basically worked like this, and all our games and movie watching devices still pretty much follow that same routine. \n\nPeople still haven\u2019t noticed it put it together. The amount of times I\u2019ve explained pretty much everything works like that, and had some light bulb go off in the other person like they just now realized that\u2019s how almost every electronic that plugs into something has worked for longer than they\u2019ve even been alive, is astounding. \n\nI agree it\u2019s simple and logical to see. I agree it\u2019s been around for multiple generations at this point. People really are just that stupid and non observant unfortunately\u2026",

Most people would not know that restart and shutdown are different.\n\nWas the idea that tech support asked the user to reboot. The user decided a reboot was clicking shutdown then powering back on. Which would mean a fast boot was performed and thus the system uptime has not been reset.\n\nThe inverse is sometimes a misconception to users as well. \"Have you tried turning it off and back on again?\" might result in the user clicking reboot. This would have the desired effect however the request was still misinterpreted by the user and for non-obvious reasons.\n\n99% of users do not know what fast boot even is. So its really not far fetched to have a user say they rebooted when they did a shutdown instead. \n\nSo saying OP saying \"I don't support liars\" seems kinda unfair to someone that could very well have done their best to follow their instructions but gets a bad attitude in return. Not to mention an IT specialist whose JOB is to work with non-tech savy users should know this is possibility and not just assume uptime is the current power on time.",

The only way it can be similar for electronics is with enforced standardization, so that you know that right clicking does this everywhere, or touching and holding on a touchscreen does the same thing. The advantage that younger people have is that they are more likely to learn faster and retain those lessons.

I had it to the point I flatly asked her to explain where she wrote down the temp password (right in front of her, 20+ attempts in) and had to remind her to look down to read said password, which she still got wrong. It took giving her the password one letter at a time to get her logged in, and at that point I considered it job done, asked if she was satisfied with being logged in and ducked out of the call because at 50 minutes my supervisor was asking what was taking so long.\n\nSome people should not be operating anything more challenging than a television remote, but do.\n\n\n\"What about where the remote software is installed by company policy and they are an employee?\"\n\nOK sure, I have had issue with that, too. The remote software that typically gets used has a pop up saying \"<agent> is requesting remote access to your machine\" |OK/CANCEL| and they would just keep hitting cancel even with the run up of \"the next pop up you see is me trying to see your screen, please hit ok\" to which they would accept verbally and then hit cancel again. Afterwards they did not understand the concept of shared controls, asked why their computer was acting up, and refused to let me have control. Oh yeah, there's also almost never any mouse lock-outs in the software provided either, so that's fun. \n\nAnyway TL;DR Remote software isn't the answer. People are going to be mind numbingly stupid and actively hurt your ability to help them no matter what.",

People were enamored with this communication tool enough they wanted to WORK using it, and literally force the biggest tech company in the world to adapt. And discord actually improved on it by letting textrooms and voicerooms be readjusted in the UI, or by getting rid of the atrocious threading feature where info gets lost and spam is generated onto unread feeds. And discord blew up in use because it also fixed another issue - you could share servers with a single clickable link, and try it out without installing anything, without creating an account. No asynchronous adding people, no group invitations, no weird IP's, nothing. Click, you're in. It's a real \"wrong side of history\" opinion to try and hate on it because the improvement was tremendous.",

They've gone through massive changes in what a computer even is, from pure text inputs, to full GUI, and then phones and tablets, throughout the time in their life that they were most open to learning. So having habitual techniques of trial and error and searching online for answers is likely to be more prevalent as they went through the periods of people throwing things at a wall to see what worked. For example, touching and holding on a touchscreen to do an action, or pressing ESC to cancel something, the former would be intuitive to gen z and the latter to boomers and gen x, but both would be something that millennials would likely try in context and wouldn't think anything of it.  \n\nObviously I'm commenting on generalizations but I think it mostly holds up.",

Office products are almost universal and there's countless websites out there that tell people how to do basic stuff in Excel or Outlook.\n\nThis isn't just IT - if I have to do some job round the house and I've never done it before, you bet I'm going to check to see if someone's already posted a video online how to do it properly.\n\nI had a unicorn once. I asked a user to send me a screenshot of what she was seeing. She did and I could see from one of her Chrome tabs in the screenshot that she'd googled: \"how to take a screenshot.\"\n\nI'm also astounded how many people don't just ask someone in their team first. In one job, we have interns who'd raise tickets asking how to do stuff, and I'd just think: \"you're an intern, and you're here to learn. Why isn't your supervisor showing you how to do this?\"",

We provide students with a handbook that answers most of the questions we get. For assessments a lot of this information is repeated in several places. And yet there is outrage when we don't answer their super specific questions and ask them to check these resources. \n\nGod forbid they should have to google something - such as the contact details for IT when their password has expired because they ignored all the regular reset reminders that start to send twenty days before their password is due to expire.\n\nBy the way, a lot of these students are in their twenties and have at least degree educated.",

And they treat the people as if they were children playing pretend. Even though they think of the inside of a computer or fusebox as literal magic. \n\nNot to mention higher ups in companies. Some will constantly lament about why they are paying so much for IT when everything works. So they cut back on IT. Then a few months later they will scream and yell about paying so much for IT when \"nothing works\". Then they fire everyone but 1-2 people from IT and hire an outside firm to deal with IT, like they would with electricians/plumbers. \n\nBut because of how much modern companies use computers. Doing that is like a waterpark firing their plumbers and having to call a company in every other day to fix things. And in the long run it costs **A LOT** more.",

People don't know what a power button is, don't know what the internet is (It's not facebook), etc.... I am so happy that my talent had always been to speak simple and in easy words to people and not what most perceive as technobabble. So many IT people I have met, were introverts, had problems to socially interact with non-tech people. I understand because to become really good at this, you did not have a popular social life. I only dedicated my teenage years to this because I did not have many friends and girls were out of reach. I am talking about end of 80s, beginning of 90s. If I was popular, were invited to parties, I would not have gotten into IT.\n\nBTW I was the happiest man, when technology got fast enough to allow remote control of the devices. When somebody called with an issue, I did not need to decipher what that person needs, I could just log in and see myself.",

Repair guy will be there next day anyways. We end the call and I go back to deploying new hire macbooks.\n\n30 minutes later she messages asking when I am sending the USB keyboard. I say nah fam, we already agreed the dell tech will show tomorrow, the current keyboard mostly functions fine, and you specifically told me not to send it.

So at this point she is refusing to pick up the keyboard despite me not being able to ship for the rest of the day. \n\nNext day the dell tech is reaching out to her to schedule a time for the repair. She starts telling me in private chat she would like to be available for him but she needs to stop by the office for the temp keyboard...\n\nLuckily the dell tech wasn't going to be free for her repair till 2 soo\n\nI updated her in the same chat as her manager saying \"looks like the dell repair tech can't make it till this afternoon, so if you would like the temp USB keyboard, go ahead and head this way. We can get it swapped and send you home before the repair guy shows\".\n\nAll of a sudden she no longer needed to make a trip to the office for the temp keyboard.\n\nNot the best IT story but it is therapeutic to bitch.",

He said, don't worry yet because he had an expert that was going to come in.    \n\n\nGet a call back and hour later: \"You need to get back here ASAP.  Expert was here and says there's all sorts of problems with the way the environment was built and it is so bad he can't do anything about it.\"\n\n(NOTE:  I had already suggestion a whole series of basic troubleshooting steps which I was told were triple checked)\n\nHop back in my car and drive 6 hours (probably in 4 hours) and arrive at the office.  Boss is looking at me PO'd because his expert said things were such a mess.  I explain to him that I strongly disagree with that assessment, but let's figure out this issue first.  \n\nLiterally the \\*FIRST\\* thing I see when looking in the server room is that ...... the Email Server was powered off.    \n\n\nMe - \"Hey, why is the email server off?  I thought you guys said you double checked that?\" (and 20 other things that should have indicated the server was down)  \n\n\nBoss - /looks totally confused w/ a side of \"oh shit did I really chew this guy out and make him drive 6 hours because a machine was off?\"  \n\n\nMe - /flips on server, waits a minute for bootup, everything is back to running.  \n\nAs soon as I confirmed everything was good, I turned around, left, hopped back in my car, and my it back to the event in \\~3.5 hours..... (it was going on midnight at this point so......)\n\nCame to find out later, that building maintenance as in the room doing something and apparently unplugged machines w/o notifying anyone.

Not only was this laughable in itself, but I told her to press F5 and the widget reloaded with the \"correct\" temp and she was impressed beyond words that I had somehow reprogrammed/ recalibrated the widget for the whole company just for her. And, of course, trainer called to yell that the monitor in the training suite was dead and she had new hires coming in any second...and this always happens...and our stuff is crap compared to where she used to work...and OF COURSE she had checked if it was plugged in....and no I don't think she's an idiot by asking her to check both ends of the power cable one more time because I can remotely connect to that computer  just fine...and yes I'll immediately drive 45 mins to fix it. You know how this story ends. Not only WAS the power cable unplugged from the back of the monitor, but it was dangling there for the whole world to see.

We had card key security doors all over that were controlled by individual node boxes for each door all feeding to a central computer in the security control room. One night, about 12am, all the nodes went offline one by one. A tech support engineer was called and the guy traveled for 2 hours to fix it. He spent the next five hours trying to diagnose the problem, testing the main computer, then checking each individual door control node but could not find the cause of the problem. \n\nAt 7am I walked in the control room to see the night shift manager watching a very stressed engineer working on the main computer. You could cut the tension with a knife. After watching for a minute I happened to look at a small toggle switch next to the computer that diverts the computer to a backup system. I asked \u201cEr, isn\u2019t that switch supposed to be \u2018On\u2019, it\u2019s \u2018Off\u2019?\u201d. The engineer reached over, flicked the switch and all the nodes came back on one by one. \n\nWhat had happened is the manager didn\u2019t notice he had knocked the switch when picking up a file. To say the engineer was relieved and pissed off at the same time is an understatement. After that incident they moved the switch and put a cover over it.\n\nTL;DR An IT engineer spent seven hours trying to fix a problem when all that was needed was to flick a switch.",

However, upon a successful reboot, the practice manager confronted me, furious because the coffee maker in the breakroom was no longer working and she insisted it was because I rebooted one of the servers. Of course, this was just a regular old fashioned coffee maker, no network connection, I explained to her that the two issues weren\u2019t related, and left to return to my office. She ended up complaining to my manager and got my company to replace their coffee maker. I even got a \u201ctalking to\u201d from my manager about the situation, which promptly ended with me telling him to fuck off and I quit on the spot.",

          "text": "I think they just end up coming off like that because so many of the people they deal with are idiots. \n\nMany years ago I was a csr for a cable company for a few months. Most of my work was pretty straight forward, setting up new service, canceling service, stuff like that. I handled troubleshooting too. This was before broadband internet was widespread so all my troubleshooting calls were tv related. I had a standard list of questions to ask and I could check for outages. 9 times out of 10, unplugging the cable box for 39 seconds and plugging it back in would fix the problem. If not, I\u2019d send a tech. \n\nOne time, this guy called that was super upset that his cable wasn\u2019t working. I checked and it turned out we had an outage in his area but my info didn\u2019t have a reason or eta for repair. I told him as much and that we were working on the issue and would have his tv back up as soon as we could. He decided the best way to get his tv back was to tell me \u201cwell you better get it working again soon. If you don\u2019t, let\u2019s just say I know where your main line is and I have a good set of bolt cutters!\u201d  I informed him that doing what he implied would definitely make it take much longer to get his tv working again and that he would certainly face criminal chargers for any damage he caused. He hung up. \n\nThe point is, when people have a problem, they aren\u2019t always interested in doing what needs to be done to get the problem fixed asap. Sometimes they just need someone to vent to, or threaten, or whatever. In IT, they also have the added pleasure of dealing with people who mostly know absolutely nothing about computers. These people just want it to work. You can fix it, and tell them what to do or not do to avoid the issue in the future, and they\u2019ll nod and say yes yes yes, but they haven\u2019t heard a word you\u2019ve said. They\u2019ll keep doing that same stupid thing you told them not to, probably even lie to you about it if you follow up and ask about it, and when it breaks again, they just want you to drop everything and come fix it immediately because they\u2019ve got some important deadline or whatever. \n\nMost of the people probably have degrees in computer science and know how to do all kinds of amazing things and thought they\u2019d use their knowledge to design high end networks and optimize workflows and all kinds of interesting things. \n\nSo, I bet it\u2019s probably pretty easy to sound condescending when you spend your days resetting passwords and changing keyboard batteries and driving two hours to push a power button. It\u2019s not not because they think they\u2019re better than you or anything. They just have to adjust their baseline approach to account for the lowest common denominators. Just because you\u2019re (presumably) not one of those people doesn\u2019t mean they have any way of immediately knowing that.",

Their name is *[name]* as they will be able to assist you further. \"    \n\n3 days go by. No answer. Then I get 3 messages in a few hours:        \n\"*W_P* we do not see any issue right now please confirm\" (yeah, because it happened a week ago and my boss only now got the logs)    \n\"*W_P* we do not have issue anymore please confirm we cannot find any logs with your name\" (1: doesn't work like this and 2: I provided them the logs already 3: I know it's not right now and that is what I said...)     \n\"*W_P* we closed ticket due to no response\" (Without providing any explanation why the issue happened)   \n\nMy friends tell me I have the patience of a saint. I don't get annoyed easily. But Jesus Christ the INCOMPETENCE of the IT people at my work to even read a fucking ticket, yet alone do the most basic thing I ask them to do is insane. Like what am I supposed to do? Do their job for them? I can't even access my own files without it giving a permissions error lmfao. \n\nSomeone even locked me out of my own work ID for 3 fucking days, so my manager on her free day (bless her) had to chase the IT people. And they just kept referring me to their IT desk \"please make a ticket here\" when I called their number - so when I finally was able to reach someone on the phone who looked at my ticket, it was the most sexist, de-humiliating experience I had ever had where they talked down to me in such a manner I legitimately considered quitting. It's insane. \n\nI currently have a ticket that's been open for 3 weeks because I cannot open excel without it crashing my entire work laptop. My colleague has the exact same issue. My fucking bosses boss has been chasing the IT department every other day. They don't even *respond* to their e-mails, I see this because I'm cc:d in the chain. How on earth this is possible I have no idea. And then they have the audacity to complain they are being paid too little when they are getting paid more than me. \n\nSorry, had to rant, this has been on my chest for such a long ass time. My work is otherwise fine, but the IT department is somehow so fucking bad I'm mega stunned.",

So they sent my dad stuck in the back of supply truck and said I'm sure you can fix it, your smart.\nThankfully kicking it was a valid solution.",

I wish I didn't have to, but you get a feel for the types of people that make this a necessity.\n\nMy usual tricks are based on having them work through a related but mostly irrelevant instruction for any routine action that they might give you grief over. They can't lie about having already restarted if you ask them to shut down and hold the power button for 30 seconds, or have them run a mostly irrelevant command before performing a basic troubleshooting step, or advise that they boot into safe mode after performing an SMC/NVRAM reset. \n\nSome people will fight you if you advise basic troubleshooting, either because they think that their problem is some world-first historical catastrophe that must require advanced rocket surgery despite it just being an unplugged mouse, or that they're too smart to \"fall for\" the old turn it off and on again, or they're afraid that you're right and they have wasted their time and yours (NOT, they don't care about your time or the time they're taking from people waiting that actually need support).\n\nI'm not sure what I'm ranting about anymore, but please people, just stop fighting with the people that are paid to help you.

When we came up the room these 6 students told all panicking they tried for over an hour to troubleshoot but now cracked and needed help. My supervisor looked at the screen and then the laptop for like 5 seconds and said \"It isn't plugged in?\" and plugged in the VGA cable. And ofc it worked.

So that one trip likely lowered that person\u2019s performance score\u2026 and what is that performance score used for? Bonuses, raises, disciplinary actions, etc.\n\nFinally, IT gets very bitter because typically the person who causes the problem (I.e. turned off the server in the first place) will never get corrective action or any repercussions.\n\nJust the other day, I saw an IT person get let go because the boss was having WiFi issues. The WiFi was fine, but the boss\u2019s computer (BYOD) was so old, it wouldn\u2019t roam between APs correctly. That IT person had been trying to get the boss to accept a new computer for years, but the boss liked the old one. Despite the WiFi provably being not the problem AND the boss being on record as having refused the solution (new computer with modern WiFi card) multiple times, the IT guy was let go for being \u201cunable to keep WiFi performing\u201d.",

That isn't how it works in this business. A contract has already been made, prices have already been settled, things like drive time and employees needed to complete the project have already been priced out.  Unless you work for best buy or something your company is not being paid hourly even if you are.   Finishing a job in 3 hours thats already been paid a day is always a bonus. Maybe not for the person doing thr grunt work but certainly for the business as a whole. I have to be honest, I suspect I'm arguing with a 16 year old who has absolutely no idea what they are talking about.  You seem to have no idea how jobs are priced or managed. I guess it's possible you could be totally unaware of the things going on that aren't directly your job but it's difficult to believe.",
