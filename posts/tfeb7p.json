You're not objectively wrong for thinking y is a vowel, because languages like Norwegian and Swedish primarily use it for the I-like sound and consider the letter a vowel! The most unhelpful thing when learning about a/an here is that \"it's based on the start of the word being a vowel or consonant, and y is not a vowel\" because both of those are emphasized at once and it implies spelling matters for this grammatical rule!",

Learning a 2nd language from childhood is no more difficult to them than learning their home language. And it's used enough to keep fluent \n\n\n2) A lot of other languages, like the romance languages, share roots that make them easier to learn if you're already fluent in a sister language. English is a melting pot of a ton of other languages' words and doesn't really help you learn other languages because the rules and words are all over the place.\n\n\n3) Americans outside of business have much less inventive and opportunity to learn a 2nd language unless it's on a personal level. And if they do want to, their choice is scattered across the globe. It's usually more of a hobby to be more learned than it is useful. In my school foreign language classes began in 8th grade but weren't required, and then in highschool you only were required to take one year of French, German, or Spanish. Then everything's forgotten soon after   \n\n\n\nObviously, it's still cringe when Americans make fun of foreigners for not speaking English well, when they almost certainly don't speak any amount of a foreign language themselves.",

Five seconds of google to double check their fact is all it would have taken. \n\nWe also have 331 million (probably more like 350 million, no shock, but the census run by the previous guy missed about 20 million people) and we have hundreds of languages spoken here. Spanish, Mandarin, Japanese, Korean, Italian, Swedish, French, Tagalog, among so many others. One fifth of the US speaks something besides English at home. \n\nAnd yet, \u201cBe American, speak English!\u201d is screamed by so many Karens.  America is a melting pot. You think they all learn English before they come?  That their kids all speak perfect English, or prefer it?  \u201cI don\u2019t need something else, I\u2019ll never use it!\u201d  There are places in the US where it\u2019d be better to have another language, and there are places outside the US. \n\nBut hey, the American educational system is fine.

If you don't, then census workers come by and start knocking on doors (or looking through homeless encampments).  They literally want to count every person in the country.  Ideally on the honor system where I tell you how many people live in my household, who's the head of house, what our ethnicities are, our ages, all of that.  But if not, someone will come and knock and ask who lives there.  We do it every ten years.\n\nBut Agent Orange stopped the count early and pulled workers off of it.  It's estimated we missed 20 million people.  These are people needed to be counted so we'd know how many people need educational, health, transportation, etc. services.  Do they need senior care in an area or more preschools?  Or both?  Are they a rural population or have they experienced a growth in the last 10 years and more focus should be spent on their roadways?  Some of this is at the county and state level, but some is national.  I grew up near a US highway.  The US paid for it.  If my town had gone from 1000 people to 10,000 people in about nine years, it would have changed the roadway a lot.  They may have changed how they budget for that area.  It's little stuff like that.  \n\nThe US is made up of villages/towns/cities, county/parish (Louisiana only), states, and then the overall country.  I've seen on wikipedia pages where some places have down their own count in 2018 or something, but many use past growth/decline to estimate a 2018 population based on the 2010 numbers from the last census.  It's such an important number that ends up getting used everywhere (how many vaccine doses do we buy for each age group, where are they needed, how many kids do we need to vaccinate?).  For the US a pandemic would have been a lot better NOT under Trump, and at the beginning of a decade.  We'd have better and more solid numbers.  But it works usually pretty well.  By the end of the decade, though, they're getting old.\n\nI am NOT a census expert, if someone is please come behind me and correct me.  But this is the basic way it works and why it's done.",

Then you have markup languages you may not have even heard of like MathML, SGML, or DITA.\n\nOne could argue, that to function in a future, more computer orientated world, people really out to know more markup languages than Markdown, and really out to know *other* types of computer languages. But then you'd say \"But other than markdown, I don't use computer languages in my day to day!\" Well, that applies to most Americans and non-English languages. Some may know a second (or some of a second) from their ESL parents, but not always. My parents speak fluent Spanish. Growing up, they spoke English directly to my siblings and I. We went to an English speaking school, watched English speaking television, read English-written books. In the end, English is our first and only language, we picked up curse words and some brief phrases in Spanish, and continued on with our lives.

          "text": "Other answers are being frankly way, way to generous to my countrymen, sadly. This may come off as a bit dismissive, but I consider the real answer to your question to be as follows: because american education is woefully deficient and there is zero incentive for us to restructure our system for functional language learning because we barely attain good learning outcomes for our most basic subjects, so why try even harder to deliver quality foreign language classes that americans are often taught to view as useless burdens, or worse, are taught are unamerican?\n\nAmerican schools are just... struggling. That is a whole issue unto itself, really, but is the major factor to consider. I have many friends in education, and the stories i hear of the corners we have to cut really paint a depressing picture of how underserved american students are if they can't participate in programs like AP or IB. Schools can barely scrape together the funds and organization to implement improved curriculums, like better ENGLISH classes even (over half of americans have reading/writing proficiency below a 6th grader/11year old), so having actual, useful foreign language courses before students reach highschool (age 14) is just a fantasy. We can't even find teachers for math courses, where do we find capable foreign language teachers? In the state of Delaware, for instance, our struggle to find teachers willing to work for the comically low pay in terribly stressful conditions is so great that our governors \"solution\" was to wave the requirement to actually be educated and licensed as a teacher to teach in delaware schools. We have 30+ students in classrooms with ONE teacher, so even if you don't have any credentials as a teacher or in education we will put you in a classroom just to reduce the teacher/student ration. Even if you attend a school with funds for foreign language courses/teachers, those highschool level language courses are simply not made to teach fluency: They are designed to give students the most basic knowledge of the language that can be demonstrated on standardized written tests, with minimal speaking components. We start teaching much later than most any other country.\n\nWe just don't prioritize it here. Fuck, we are practically HOSTILE to foreign languages because racism in america runs so deep most people will associate speaking some foreign languages with being, ya know, *foreign*, and therefor a second-class citizen. The language doesn't even have to be foreign to our country. Americans will shame other citizens for speaking Spanish in public. Like seriously, the ability to speak spanish in this country is often associated with being poor and lower-class and, ironically, less educated. Learning spanish outside of schooling in america has the connotation of learning to speak with \"the help\" or other blue-collar jobs like construction laborers, farmers or kitchen staff. To be bilingual is a trait of the working-class and immigrants and neither of those groups are viewed favorably by a LARGE swath of americans. Now, obviously this is not the attitude of ALL americans, but i can't pretend for a second that it isn't a huge factor in the american aversion to bilingualism at the systemic level. Even if plenty of individuals want to learn another language, there are forces that oppose establishing public education of foreign languages. Also, ot is absurd to say, as some people who have responded to you wrote, that americans simply don't live near other countries/people that speak foreign languages (like europeans) that would encourage us to learn them, and i gotta say that is total BULLSHIT because we have a massive spanish-speaking population, on a continent where canada is the only other english speaking country, while actively holding spanish speaking territories like Puerto Rico. There are plenty of people to be speaking to. But again, spanish is considered \"low class\", while languages like french are commonly offered as options because french is considered more \"classy\". While it still is nothing more than a fancy trick to be able it speak it here, some languages garner more respect from americans. In fact, that is something of a brutal irony now that i think about it: Learning languages is respectable to americans only if it is used in service of business or other activities associated with the \"upper class\". Did you learn italian so you can vacation in the Mediterranean and converse with the locals? You are likely considered a capable and savvy person of great privilege and skill. Learn spanish to speak with your co-workers on the construction site? Be prepared to hear people complain about \"why all these darn immigrants can't just learn english and speak like americans already\" or how they are taking jobs from us by coming to work here, \"making\" us have to learn spanish. I heard the latter bit a LOT while working at a construction supplier.\n\nThe myth of American Exceptionalism also just perpetuates our insistence that English is the lingua franca of the world and so we don't *need* to learn another language, since everyone else will just accommodate us and learn english. This is a shortsighted perspective in my opinion, even if it is sort of functionally true. Because MANY people abroad learn english for business or practically, americans are deluded into thinking english is somehow superior and more useful to other languages (hence why they might think most other peoples will learn it) and so, again, don't feel compelled to even consider the utility of being bilingual.\n\nIn short, the general attitudes towards education and foreigners in America heavily disincentivise actually commiting time or resources to language learning, as a society. If you are learning a second language in America it is usually because you took the personal time and effort to do so, and went through costly lessons or were really, really commited in other ways. American cultural perspectives influence our politics, which influences how our public education is administered, and the end result is that most american students receive a really, REALLY lame attempt to teach them a foreign language while rarely being encouraged to pursue it outside of primary education. \n\nI am sort of rambling at this point. Pardon this huge wall of text, but i find i get rather passionate when the state of american education is being discussed. I was in a lot of different special education programs for many years here in the USA, and the discrepencies in what i would learn compared to my friends that weren't in the programs really influenced my perspective on how americans fail to achieve a lot of educational outcomes, foreign language learning being one of the big ones.",

So I'm from Georgia (the country) and our education has gotten alot better but when I was a kid, our schools were cheap old buildings with barely any facilities, our degrees didn't have much value back then and other issues. But what we did have were passionate teachers. Despite being underplayed they were great teachers. They might not be the best teachers but they made sure you learned. For example our Russian teacher, she would tell us :focus on my lip movement and copy the exact movement as I go. So she would speak Russian and observe us and she had sharp eyes, she could tell by our lip movements that some of us miss pronounced. People would call her strict but she made sure all of us were fluent in the language. So despite all the short comings I'd say it was a successful education.\n\nNow after 8th grade I moved to India. I'm half Indian and back then Indian school degrees held alot of value cuz alot of Indians were moving abroad. There education system was also called the best several times so my mom decided to send me to live with grandparents. Well lo and behold, Indian education system is what I'd call a failing. They prioritise 70% scores on theory and 30% on your rpacticals even though practical application is more important than theoritical knowledge for most average workers. And their whole system felt like \"cram the maximum info you can, score as much marks you can and forget most of what you learned afterwards\". Worst part was the teachers didn't seem passionate about it. I tried to learn French as it was optional there but the coarse was utter garbage and the teacher was also bad.\n\nLike seriously Indian education is focused on purely grades and not at all on creativity. So it is also failing and I hated it.\n\nSo I can relate to failed educations",

There are still passionate teachers showing students how to love learning and will teach well, but they are slowly disappearing. \n\nThanks for chatting with me about it.

Seeing how dominant English has become globally, we generally don't have a practical reason to learn another language other than as a hobby. The idea that if you stop using a language consistently you'll forget parts of it holds true, and the only language consistently used nationwide is English. This also varies region to region, for example here in Florida many people have a decent understanding of Spanish, but you probably won't find the same situation in Montana.\n\nSeeing notifications for responses to this comment but they're not showing up for me to reply to. This isn't an aversion of knowledge, hell I'm bilingual, this is just how Americans generally face the necessity of learning a new language. Sorry if it disgusts you and makes you want to stereotype us I guess, even though judging based on stereotypes is the lowest possible level of critical thinking",

No one calls Russians or Ukrainians \"Eastern Europeans\" unless they are talking specifically about Europe itself.\n\n  \n But because people born in the USA are already called \"American\" you would just be seen as an idiot if you said you were American, mainly outside of Latin America. \n\nI personally don't care that much about this",

Younger people have mostly learned English through TV, Social Media (youtube being the biggest), and video games. Until about 4 years ago or so, Brazil required a visa for US citizens to enter Brazil. So there wasn't really a tourism crowd to incentivize people to learn English. Now that the Visa requirement is gone there will probably be more tourism to motivate an investment in English education (once COVID is under control).\n\nMy source is I have been to Brazil and my husband is Brazilian. When we met, his English was limited basically to just 'shit talking' that he learned in video games. lol",
