Hitler and Mussolini, after all, had not tried to seem exotic to their fellow citizens. \n\n>No swastikas in an American fascism, but Stars and Stripes (or Stars and Bars) and Christian crosses. No fascist salute, but mass recitations of the pledge of allegiance.

It's been a concentrated information denial campaign. They deny people the information they need and repeatedly deny that the needed information is valid in any capacity.\n\nThis is why books like the Diary of Anne Frank, the actual books that were burned by the Nazies, accurate (non-sensationalized) historical accounts surrounding WWII and the Mauz graphic novel are treated as toxic sludge by the Right, because they clearly and understandably convey what fascism looks like.\n\nTo remedy the danger, the banned and burned books need to be spread as far as possible, and the history of Nazism told without nationalistic mayonnaise slathered all over it.\n\nTL;DR people not knowing what fascism looks like is a direct result of a very real info war, one that is fought to keep the definition vague and exploitable, and the remedy is to clarify the definition by showing what the Nazies don't want you to see.",

After World War 2 there was a push to distance themselves from the horrors of the 3rd reich by acting like victims of the regime they enabled and upheld (\"we didn't know any of that!\", myth of the clean Wehrmacht, Machtergreifung, \"just following orders\").",

Paxton defines fascism in the modern age as \"1. a sense of overwhelming crisis beyond reach of traditional solutions; 2. belief one\u2019s group is the victim, justifying any action without legal or moral limits; 3. need for authority by a natural leader above the law, relying on the superiority of his instincts; 4. right of the chosen people to dominate others without legal or moral restraint; 5. fear of foreign \\`contamination.'\"\n\nLeon Trotsky defines fascism traditionally as \" The Fascist movement in Italy was a spontaneous movement of large masses, with new leaders from the rank and file. It is a plebeian movement in origin, directed and financed by big capitalist powers. It issued forth from the petty bourgeoisie, the slum proletariat and even to a certain extent, from the proletarian masses, Mussolini, a former socialist, is a \u201cself-made\u201d man arising from this movement.\"\n\nNot surprising, Trotsky's definition rings true today, especially the part about corporate sponsorship of plebian (grassroots in todays terms) movements.\n\nMost scholars hold that fascism as a social movement employs elements from the political left, but many conclude that fascism eventually allies with the political right, especially after attaining state power.   This part is important and I am not going to explain it but I will leave it to you to comprehend, you're smart people.\n\nFinally, fascism is aligned tightly with extensive state regulation of the economy.  The Federal reserve, the IRS, bitcoin 'know your customer' rules, capital market regulations, securities and exchange commission.  Fascism thrives in over-regulation.  Many here lump libertarians in with the alt-right, falsely, but do consider the power you free grant nation states when voting, especially when it comes to government programs and more regulation, especially of economies and commodities.",
