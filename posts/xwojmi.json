Jacking up interest rates (because so much money was printed we had an explosion in inflation, plus restricting energy production (supply), which is the engine of the economy) will reduce demand.  Making permitting easier will increase supply, along with less restrictions on logging, oil and gas and mining for the raw materials that go into construction.  The very things that the Left wants to restrict in the name of the environment are the things which limit supply of what you want to buy, which pushes up prices.  Take off the regulations and supply will explode and prices will drop.  It always works that way.  It is an immutable law of economics.  Politics has nothing to do with it.

You are not. \n\nYou just said I was the victim of the government and social programs and poor people, what the heck? \n\n> The reason housing prices go up is because of shortages.\n\nWell no, we\u2019ve seen developers come in, buy apartments, and then increase the rent, sometimes by 100%, without making improvements. That increase has nothing to do with scarcity, that\u2019s price gouging. But I was talking about scarcity too - developers are buying up so many homes that they can actually have great control over market prices. And housing prices are helping to wreck the budget of the average working person. \n\nHere\u2019s the way the normal immutable laws of economics work: companies compete for customers. They do that by offering the best product at the lowest price they can charge, based off of operating costs. In so doing, the cream rises to the top: consumers go to the company offering the best mix of cost/quality. \n\nWhen the costs to a company go up (via increased wages to employees or increase cost of the supplies they require) they try to keep the books balanced by lowering internal costs where they can and, eventually, raising the price of goods. When operating costs go back down, consumer prices are reduced. That way, consumers are always given the best deal born out of honest, good-faith, fair competition. \n\nWe aren\u2019t seeing anything like that with these huge drug companies, oil companies, home developers, venture capital firms, and big food companies. These folks are not having trouble making ends meet. Normal market forces would dictate that these companies cut their internal costs to stay competitive, or else someone else will and take all of their consumers. But they aren\u2019t doing that. We have a 40 year high in inflation but a 50 year high in corporate profits. That makes absolutely no sense in the context of an economy with choked supply. That is pure corporate greed. And I only see the left willing to engage with that problem. \n\n> Politics has nothing to do with it.\n\nFirst you say that we are victims of the government and social spending and poor people. Then you say I\u2019m not a victim at all. Then you say that this is the left\u2019s fault but switch over to this having nothing to do with politics. You initially started this by saying it was taxes that was hurting us by the over-taxing left. When I pointed out that the economic pain is coming from prices from private corps, you just switched over to saying \u2018sure it\u2019s the corporate prices that are really hurting, but the left made those prices go up.\u2019\n\nIt seems like you are just trying to blame \u201cthe left\u201d for everything while dismissing the problems conservatives won\u2019t address as non-issues. I go back to what I initially said: it doesn\u2019t ring true.",

But market participants really cannot control a big commodity market like housing.  Here in Phoenix, prices were reasonable for a long time because the market was overbuilt in the early 2000s.  Then, when the RE market crash occurred in 2006-11, prices crashed to because of excess supply and not enough demand.  Gradually, the excess inventory was absorbed and prices stabilized around 2012.  Then, because of restrictive regulations in California, businesses moved to Arizona.  Employees followed and began exerting excessive demand on the RE market.  Prices doubled between 2014 and 2021.  People who did not get into a home in 2012-16 quickly saw the market get priced out of their reach.  It happens.  Now, with mortgage rates going up, demand is declining and prices are coming back down.  Soon, homes will be back within reach.  Yes, large investment companies can affect pricing in a smaller market area by buying up housing.  That happens more in rental apartments than in homes.  You can say it is gouging, but that does not really exist in a free market.  Gouging impunes the profit motive and profit or higher income is what everyone wants for a good quality of life, you included.  Market forces control profit, not charitable feelings.  If apartment rents are so high that workers cannot afford a place to live, they will move somewhere else that is more affordable.  Then demand will drop and so will rents.  But rent controls never work.  All they do is further restrict supply which makes prices go up even more.  Maybe you would rather have the government build and manage the housing?  That always ends up in poor quality, overcrowding and crime, like Cabrini-Green in the near north of Chicago that was built in the 1960s.  That project got so bad they had to tear it down.  But the crime it encouraged still remains.",

One way they exercise that control is via control of our government. Only elements of the left are working to stop that. GOP politicians are *thrilled* to take ~~bribes~~ \u201ccampaign contributions\u201d from corps in exchange for favors, often to the detriment of working people. They love Citizens United. \n\n> Yes, large investment companies can affect pricing in a smaller market area by buying up housing. \n\nPrecisely what is happening in my community and communities around me. We had a developer build one of those hideous huge apartment complexes in the area. Added something like 150+ apartments to the housing stock here, which is actually significant. Did prices go down because supply increased? Nope! They charged *more* for those apartments than the average in the area. Supply/demand had nothing to do with it. \n\nAs you noted, the way they can lower the price of houses it to make it harder for average people to by a house. All they can do is choke off demand because it doesn\u2019t matter what is on the supply side. When supply gets cheaper for corps, they keep all of that benefit. We are never seeing pre-pandemic food prices ever again. Because those corps can get away with it. \n\nTo say price gouging isn\u2019t happening is just silly. 40 year high in inflation, 50 year high in corporate profits. That\u2019s price gouging. If you are trying to couch price gouging as a good thing, or at least not a bad thing that needs addressing, you\u2019re going to find a tough crowd for that. Free market worship and trust that a largely unregulated market will lead to good results was dubious at best in the past. Since the housing collapse and the mass crimes by financial institutions, it has become a completely untenable argument. Corps almost destroyed the entire world economy with their greed and reckless behavior. And they haven\u2019t changed - they are happy to gouge us when we are hurting most. \n\nNo, government doesn\u2019t need to build and manage housing. Put stiff criminal penalties in place for price gouging and make them open up their books to see if they are arbitrarily raising their prices or refusing to lower them. Send folks to jail and penalize the shit out of their company to remove any market incentive to gouge. \n\nOn housing, significantly limit the ability of developers and venture capital firms to buy housing up when vacancy rates dip below X% and significantly increase taxes on second homes. \n\nThose are just a couple changes that would help working class people far more than further unleashing these monsters.",

That is pretty corrupt, right?  The Left is the party of billionaires today.  It used to be conservatives, but that was before the 1990s.  Since the tech industry took over the American economy and old-school manufacturing was all exported to Asia, tech rules the market, as I am sure you know.  Most, not all, tech managements are aligned with the Left with some aggressively so, like Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates.  Pelosi is the beneficiary along with all the other west coast Democrats.  On the East Coast, Chuck Schumer is aligned with Wall Street.  Today, most of the big investment houses have liberal managements.  Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan (Jamie Dimon), Blackrock (Larry Fink), Jim Chanos, Ray Dalio, George Soros, they are all liberals and donate heavily to Dem campaigns, to influence their politicians.  The billionaire Left also owns most of media:  CBS, ABC (Disney), ESPN (Disney), NBC/MSNBC/CNBC (Comcast), CNN, WaPo, NYT, The Atlantic, they are all owned by Dems who use the platform to support their politicians, whom they own.  The millionaire / billionaire entertainment industry (sports and movies) also donates heavily to Dem campaigns.  So, no, you cannot say the GOP is the only party owned by rich lobbyists.  They both are.  This is why I am an independent libertarian.  I don't want lobbyists controlling the government that wants to control me.  But libertarians do not have much political power.  So I do what I can to influence local elections for the most libertarian candidates.  I like Rand Paul but I also like Tulsi Gabbard.  Both want small government from opposite ends of the spectrum.\n\nWhere RE is concerned get involved with your local city council.  We have elected council members to our Scottsdale council to limit growth.  I have met with the council members I helped elect.  Through the zoning commission, we are blocking big development projects, though the fewer units that are built, the more pressure it puts on price: supply and demand.  But there is also a quality of life issue and we do not want Scottsdale overbuilt.  At the local level, you can have a lot of influence.",

I do not agree that the GOP is the party of the rich and vote for tax bills that benefit themselves.   The GOP is just ideologically opposed to big government and more taxes equals bigger government.  But rich liberals also like lower taxes.  They just need to pretend they don't.   It was the Senate Dems who opposed the 2017 Tax Reform (reductions which targeted the middle class through a doubling in the standard deduction which moved millions of people to zero income taxes owed, a big increase in the Child Care Tax Credit).  They claimed it was for the rich, but the CBO analysis showed the rich ended up paying more taxes, if they lived in states with high state and local taxes (SALT) like anywhere in CA or NY.  The rich did not benefit from the standard deduction increase since they mostly itemize.  If the concern is corporations paid less, I am in the camp that corporations should pay zero taxes.  There is no point in taxing corporations as it just increases their costs which are passed along to consumers anyway.  https://taxfoundation.org/2017-tax-cuts-jobs-act-analysis/\n\nAnd many of the GOP opposed Citizens United.  Not sure where you got the idea the GOP opposed that legislation since the original bill in 2002 had bi-partisan sponsorship and (11) GOP Senators supported the Act when it passed Congress in 2002 and George Bush, signed it.  It was the corporations who opposed the legislation and appealed it to the Supreme Court where the legislation was overturned on Freedom of Speech by the Constitutionalists on the court.    \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisan\\_Campaign\\_Reform\\_Act",

They favor sweeping and severe restrictions on abortion and favor government-forced births, even of rape victims. That is really big government that Dems do not approach. The most powerful and restrictive arm of the government is the police - they can kill you, they can scoop you up off the street and lock you up against your will. And we have an enormously intrusive government on that issue. Our incarcerated population is so much higher than that of other developed nation. That is big government and about as anti-freedom as government gets in this country. Dems have been advocating for criminal justice reform and protesting against police violence and where have GOP been? Backing the blue and calling us radicals. They GOP are freaking book-banning. They do not seem to have have a general issue with big government.\n\nTheir issue with big government pops up when it\u2019s used to justify cutting services for working people and cutting taxes for the wealthy. That is when it pops up. And that seems an awful lot like a principle of servitude to the rich than a rejection of big government. \n\nAs to Trump tax cuts, the benefit was to large corps, which then went into the pockets of rich folk. Do they pay more taxes in blue states (because blue states are willing to tax the rich, because they don\u2019t have a political belief in corporate servitude)? Sure. Do they have more money than they otherwise would have because of corporate profits? Yes.\n\n> Many of the GOP opposed citizens United. \n\nWhere have they been since it was passed? Uniformly voting against efforts to undo it, nominating someone to their presidential candidate who believes \u201ccorporations are people\u201d, and benefiting from that sweet sweet dark money. The proof is in their actions - GOP is good with CU. The common theme through all of this is their continued support of the rich in the face of Dem attempts to curtail their power.",

That is as extreme as legalizing hard street drugs like fentanyl or heroin with the idea that every person should do what they want to do (extremist libertarianism).  I do not support that either.  None of this has a thing to do with the size of government.  It has to do with legislating morality, which I am opposed to except for the morality that is universally agreed upon, the Ten Commandments.  I don't think any society would function if murder and theft were legalized, do you?\n\nYou are just completely wrong with taxes.  Corporate taxation is stupid.  All it does is raise prices / cause inflation and make domestic manufacturers less competitive with foreign competitors.  I thought you wanted jobs at home?  Then you can't have taxes with domestic manufacturers higher than foreign manufacturers.  Those taxes end up as costs incorporated into the products and make American goods more expensive.  Zero taxes are the only good tax for corporations.  The govt needs to get its funding from individuals.  At some point people won't work if all their income is taxed away.  So there is a human limit to how high taxes can be on individuals.  If you can't tax more because you are up against those limits, then you have to print money to make up the difference and that results in devaluing the currency which is also known as inflation.  This is where we are now.  The govt couldn't pay for all its stimmy programs with taxes so it printed.  Hyper inflation is the end game for Democrat \"give everyone money to buy votes\" policies.  You are seeing it now.\n\nRegarding your constant efforts to rip \"the GOP\", you need to show me some facts.  You are just making loose statements without any reference.  I don't accept them.  In any case, the GOP has changed a lot in the past 20 years.  During the Bush years, it was still dominated by \"Establishment\" types.  McConnell is Establishment, for example.  But I am anti-Establishment, which is why I am not GOP.  I am an independent conservative with populist / working class leanings.   That is really the soul of the GOP and the independent conservatives today.  The Establishment, like the Cheneys and Bushes and the Lincoln Project people, are politically dying.  As you noted, Trump tapped into that new conservative populism and played to it drawing much of the middle class right, including what will soon be a majority of Hispanics.  Hispanics will be the largest segment in America in 20=30 years.  As a kid, Trump was pushed to be pro-blue collar on his dad's work sites.  He relates to the NYC worker which is more than I can say for lifelong politician Joe Biden or Hillary Clinton (Bill was actually more a working class guy who grew up poor in Arkansas and that is why we all liked him).  Trump as a person is hard to like.  He is just too egocentric which makes him the pompous ass we all see.  But his adopted policy positions are what the working class right today, wants.",

Mississippi is a total ban with no exception for rape, but it does allow an exception for incest. That is much bigger government than what the right typically complains about. And, as you can see, it is not 1% of Republicans who believe it. It is such a prevalent view that it is the law in most red states. This is something the party itself believes in, not just a few nutjobs or fringe religious voters. \n\n> None of this has a thing to do with the size of government. It has to do with legislating morality.\n\nOf course it has to do with the size of government. No real definition of big government could exclude the government forcing someone to give birth against their will. Nor could it exclude the government taking control of an entire person and locking them away against their will. You can\u2019t just declare big government is just  \u201clegislating morality\u201d and then pretend it isn\u2019t big government. You just are okay with big government when it regulates something you don\u2019t like. That doesn\u2019t make you anti-big government at all. \n\n> except for the morality that is universally agreed upon, the Ten Commandments. I don't think any society would function if murder and theft were legalized, do you?\n\nWell murder and theft are only two of the Ten Commandments and prohibitions on them existed long before the Bible came along. 6-9 are perfectly good and fine. Commandments 1-4 have no place in any secular society. Commandment 5 is ambiguous at best. 10 has some real problems. If you do think we should be legislating based on Judeo-Christian values, social security, Medicare, food stamps, housing vouchers etc would be an essential part of that. Jesus was pretty clear on the moral/religious duty to help the poor. \n\n> All it does is raise prices / cause inflation and make domestic manufacturers less competitive with foreign competitors.\n\nTaxes aren\u2019t going to take away the incentive to outsource. Foreign countries have fewer safety regulations and other worker protection laws. No Union protection for workers. The dollar is stronger in foreign countries so buying equipment, facilities, and labor is just cheaper. Lowering corporate tax changes none of that. The incentive to outsource remains.\n\nAs to your economic theory about corporate taxes, you folks have been given over 40 years to show it works. That\u2019s more than enough time/chances. We have lowered regulations and taxes for 40+ years. Have wages kept up with inflation (to say nothing of the cost of housing, education, and healthcare)? Has the wealth gap increased or decreased? Did they pass all of those wonderful tax saving onto consumers? How much better is the average working person doing? The answer to all of that is that it has gotten worse. We lowered corporate taxes and things have gotten worse. This tax-cutting theory is not unlike communism: fine on paper, utter disaster when put into practice. We know now that what you are saying doesn\u2019t work. \n\nWe aren\u2019t even approaching the limit of taxing high earners and corporation. We have sustained tax levels so so much higher than this in the past. The problem is that Republicans cut taxes and promise they will pay for themselves. They don\u2019t pay for themselves but rather than undoing the mistake because it didn\u2019t work, Republicans just declare that we have to cut social programs instead. We really just need to be cleaning up the mess that has been made by so many useless tax cuts. Republicans are the ones who have really unbalanced the books, go back and look at debt and deficit by presidents since Reagan\u2019s now debunked supply side economic theory was put into place. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what claims about GOP you take issue with. I\u2019ve tried to say everything as straightforwardly and fact-based as I can. If you think there is something that needs support, I should be able to support it if you point it out. \n\nAs to the \u201cestablishment\u201d rejection, Trump took on RNC chairman as his chief of staff and made McConnell\u2019s wife a member of his cabinet. The RNC supported his presidency. They are still paying his legal fees. Trump got his judges from the Federalist Society, which is a poster child of the GOP establishment. And he parrots the same supply-side economic talking points we\u2019ve seen from the GOP establishment for the past 40 years. I agree that he claimed to be anti-establishment. But other than rage at establishment people for not being sufficiently loyal/supportive, I\u2019m not sure how he isn\u2019t supposed to be establishment. \n\nAnd the idea that Trump is somehow a supporter of working people was laughable when he was claiming it. I don\u2019t deny he pretended he was and swindled a lot of working people doing so. But he isn\u2019t. He isn\u2019t philanthropic. He did set up a charity, but it was a big fraud and had to be shut down. We know that he got his working-class supporters to donate to a non-existent election fund, another con of working people. His presidency was hostile to unions and he stacked the NLRB with corporate-friendly members. He reduced the number of workers who are eligible for overtime and he cut down on the amount of workplace safety inspections that can be done. He refused to prevent government contractors from offshoring call center jobs, hurting US workers. The list of ways he has hurt/tried to hurt working people in favor of corps is too long to name. It was clear in 2016 that he was lying but now no one can now claim he cares about working people. Or, at least, no one can claim that his administration acted in a way that cared about working people. Criticize Biden if you want, but he supports unions, is trying to balance the books on the backs of the Uber-wealthy, not the working class, and is working to make sure the US is well-positioned as the world moves away from fossil fuels. He\u2019s done a lot more for me than Trump ever did.",

I.e., by supporting corporate mergers and union busting preventing you from steady and reliable work, hold you back by stopping education funding, and make survival a challenge by ever increasing the cost of living - it\u2019s not democrats shutting down oil refineries - while trying to eliminate minimum wage and increasing taxes on the middle class. While I admit that government benefits are high, much of those benefits are going to the elderly via SSI and Medicaid. What is not recorded in the government budget are the huge amounts of cash value that is being handed out to big business that used to bring in money like mining logging and drilling on federal land while their taxes are decreased, contracts to the highest bidder, and ever decreasing taxes on imports making items made in third world countries or China or India cheaper than those at home. It\u2019s a huge amount of income loss that makes our budget look like the drain is because of moochers, but it\u2019s not the poor citizens getting too much. I won\u2019t even go into military spending or tax fraud that the rich can do that poor people without LLC\u2019s and a CFO can, or incorporating in tax free states when you live and operate in high Tax states, or the fact that without left leaning states and cities, rural right leaning ones would go bust. There is plenty of blame for the left over spending, but it\u2019s only seen as over spending because the right in the late 60s, 70s and peaked in the 80\u2019s where they saw an opportunity for exploitation that has steadily continued until today. I know you will have a reply and nit pick what I\u2019ve typed on my phone to try to explain the other side, and you\u2019ll likely keep voting against your own self interest by voting for the guys that never want you at their level or social status, and keep ignoring the truth, but you\u2019re only hearing one side of the story from people who love it as it is, but I had to try\u2026",

Independence requires people fend for themselves, are responsible for their own education (universities only indebt and impoverish people without giving them the tools for a career), grow their own food, if possible, own their own small business (then you don't need to worry about unions, which are just another form of subjugation), I own mine and no, I do not employ anyone to exploit.  It is just me and the customer.  The very industries you want to eliminate contribute taxes to run the government.  I am fine with almost no government and so we will not need much taxation.  But if you insist on taxing everyone more, you will get less of what you tax.  Do you think people are just going to stick around and get robbed?  No, they leave.  \"Money goes to where it is treated well\", one of the oldest sayings in the book.  I do like your idea about applying tariffs to cheap imported goods.  All Americans do when they import and buy cheap goods is transfer our national wealth to another country and enable exploitation of that country's poor and the environment where there are much less protections than here.  Encouraging mass immigration only makes the country and you poorer.  You bring in several hundred million poor, uneducated immigrants over time and who will care for all of them?  You will and it will make you that much poorer.  People just need to wake up and look in the mirror.  There you will see the problem.  Depending on others for your success is the road to Hell.  It is not too late to get off that road.",

You'd rather buy the bullshit from some dumbass article written by a dumbass journalist paid by big corporation to pump out propaganda that everything's fine and dandy! Don't look up! \n\nMy dude, We're killing the planet because there's too many of us and we require too many resources because there's too many of us. We're destroying our own natural habitat with our reproduction habits and thinking that we need to live like kings. My dude, we're causing the sixth mass extinction period on the planet. I don't know if you're smart enough to grasp this concept or not, but extinction events are *not fucking good*. Maybe instead of worrying about your precious economy, which has existed for less than a hundred years and has absolutely wrecked the planet by an alarming amount in that short span of time, you should be worried about the natural systems of the earth which have existed for *billions* of years and, while resilient, are really fucking fragile compared to the size of the human ego. And I don't know if you know this or not *but we require those fucking systems to survive.* Humans got along just fucking fine for thousands of years without your precious capitalist economy, without *9 billion fucking people on the planet* but *good fucking luck* trying to live on a planet that has no breathable air, and is boiling everything on it alive, there's no drinkable water, and where no fucking plants will grow because we destroyed the soil. And I don't know if you know *this* or not, *but we fucking require those things for survival.* The fucking world will tick on perfectly fine without capitalism and your precious economy. The world will *not* tick on perfectly fine without the millions of species of plants and animals that keep the fucking ecosystem in order. \n\nAnd by bringing more fucking humans on the planet, we're only going to *drastically* compound the problem. We need to *significantly* reduce our consumption of natural resources, our pollution, and our numbers if we, as a species, are to have any chance of survival. We need to *desperately* allow time for the environment to recover. If we don't we are *absolutely fucking boned* as a species. You either choose collapse of capitalism, or collapse of our entire species, our entire food chain, and there's no fucking way we'd survive the latter while the former is definitely survivable. \n\nWe're looking at a *very* bleak future if we don't learn how to integrate sustainability into every facet of our lives, and that includes drastically cutting our numbers. We have *no* future if we continue to reproduce at our current rate. We need to get back down to at *least* 5-6 billion if we're going to have any shot of surviving this, if not significantly less. \n\nClimate change has already started. Just fucking look around you. Remember what it was like only a decade or so ago. Our weather was not *nearly* this bad, our summers not nearly as hot or drought -stricken, some regions have too much rain while others have none, in regions where that's highly unusual. Our storms and hurricanes get worse and worse, the winters are extremely harsh when they come. Weather is becoming more and more highly unpredictable. Our fucking power grids can't keep up because they weren't designed for this extreme of weather. People are fucking dying from overheating in summer or being frozen out during winter. Lakes are drying up at a drastic rate. We're having 100 year, 500 year floods every other year. The fucking West Coast and Australia is on fire every fucking year. The fucking icecaps are melting. Global pandemics are happening because we're encroaching on wildlife that we don't usually have close contact with. Species are dying off at an alarming rate. \n\nYou're one of the fucking idiots who lives on this planet, aren't you? Why the fuck would you not want to save it???",

I'd have kids when I could afford them.  \n\nMy 40s came and I was still childless, but now I was struck with endometriosis that would take away my ability to ever have kids. I tried for years in vain to conceive naturally and it never happened. \n\nI'd need tens of thousands of dollars that I didn't have for unguaranteed fertility treatments, and probably would need a surrogate to safely carry a pregnancy. It wasn't going to happen. \n\nIt was then I decided that my genetics aren't exceptional enough for me to have any need to pass them onwards anyway, plus, I love the children I never got to have enough to not bring them into this world, as dysfunctional, sociopathic, and narcissistic as it is. \n\nWhat would have been my children were either purged from my body every month, or they remain forever encased and shrunken in my ovaries for the rest of my life. \n\nMy dream for my future died when I entered the American workforce and I realized I would never be paid fairly or adequately to have the life I envisioned for myself.\n\nI will forever be sad I never got to be anyone's mama, but the blessing in helping me cope is seeing the future that is being laid ahead of us all, and nobody is winning unless they come from a background that already assured their success and desires from conception and being born to \"the right people\".",

I've talked to dozens more who are considering it and had questions about it. \n\nI think most women are feeling anxious though. Abortion bans are usually not the only right that goes when you look at countries that have implemented them historically, especially countries that ban them so aggressively, with little to no exceptions. Looking at the history of these policies and how prevalent they have been (and how they often have nothing to do with \"saving a fetus\" but are done for ulterior motives) and it lets you know how truly scary the world can be for women. \n\nI personally have experienced rape in my life and the overturning of Roe was incredibly triggering, especially when my state banned abortion with no exceptions for rape. All the feelings of having my autonomy forcibly taken away from me flooded my body and would not leave. I had nightmares about being pregnant in the hospital, hemorrhaging from some pregnancy complication, and begging for them to save me, but the doctors just wouldn't even turn around to face me. I started profiling strangers at the grocery store - does this man look like a rapist? would this woman tell me that my rape, if it ended in pregnancy, was an opportunity? \n\nI just couldn't do it anymore. I needed to not see every person in my life as a threat or potential threat to my autonomy or life. Got my tubes removed and I feel safe again. I wouldn't say I'm back to normal as I'm still grieving the decision, but I ultimately know it was the best decision because it guaranteed my reproductive autonomy. My life was going to look different either way. I was going to either become a shell of a person, afraid of everyone, afraid of risk and chances, or being blamed for needing a healthcare service. Or I was going to have the knowledge that I could not be raped into involuntary servitude but might have to make peace with my life not looking exactly how I want it to. Moving on is easier sometimes.",

Nor did they allude to it being the entirety.\n\nHowever, that being said, Boomers are primed for being \"right-wing nutjobs\" for the simple fact that they grew up in a time where education wasn't prioritized. A not-insignificant number of them don't even have high school educations as many left school in their Junior and Senior years to enter the workforce early.\n\nMany of them are also upper middle class homeowners. Older undereducated upper middle class white Christian homeowners, and their children, are the vast majority of the \"right wing nutjob\" population. Unfortunately for them, they'd more often be better served by Democratic policies, not Republican. But they've been lied to, and don't have the education levels to immediately understand what they've been told is stupid, senseless, and plain wrong. As a group they're easily radicalized, as we've seen the past 6 years. I'd feel more sorry for them if they weren't so damned dangerous in their current state.\n\nNow, does this apply to all of them? Obviously not. But to a significant number of them? Yes. *Especially* amongst the states of the midwest, where agricultural work dominated, and amongst the poorer southern states where families simply couldn't afford for children to not work and chip in for the good of the family.\n\nHope I did a better job explaining the thinking, without the seemingly senseless generalization made before.\n\nAlmost forgot to add though: where it comes to the current thing with abortion rights, even a lot of the \"right wing nutjobs\" aren't in favor of this bullshit. This is the ideals of about 35% of the population somehow being held over the rest of the 65% and it makes 0% sense.",

I just believe in a more libertarian view, where the fetus is violating the NAP by using a woman's body without her consent :\\^)  \n\n2. I guess I couldn't say \"my mother\" but I imagined we're using that phrase as a stand-in for \"woman who got knocked up\", and just using my mother as the easiest example, since she did at one point or another, get knocked up. Who knows, maybe she'd have had another kid when she's good and ready, like most women who have abortions do.\n\n3. I wouldn't have the ability to resent as I would not have developed faculties to be aware of my existence in the first place.\n\nEither way, I didn't believe you approached the discussion in good faith in the first place, and I don't believe there's any use in pursuing this conversation further.",

And I don't think you have ever thought about it, at least in the context of it being a pointless argument against abortion.\n\nIf I had never been born, the absence of my existence would effect no one, including me, who would not exist. 385,000 babies are born every day. An infinite number of babies are not born every day. Infinity, times the number of years that humans have existed, babies have not been born so far. No one is missing them. Except maybe you?\n\nIf you believe that in some cosmic way, I was \"meant to be\", then you surely must believe that whatever cosmic force means it will make it happen. If I had not been born into the family I was, then, of course, I would have been born into a different family. Right? Or is abortion the only thing that humans can do to defy the higher powers?\n\nDid you ever think that if your grandmother had a headache that night you would not exist? So you must think that marital rape should not be illegal.\n\nDid you ever think that if your mother said she did not want to go out with your dad, you would not exist? So you must think that women do not have the right to say no to men. Ever.\n\nDid you ever think that, if somewhere back in your family tree, an older man did not force himself on a little girl, you would not exist? So you must think that pedophilia is just fine.\n\nSeriously though, what philosophy or religion is it that teaches you that each of us has only one chance to be born and that if a woman doesn't do what she is \"supposed to\" we will never exist, but our consciousness will be out there somewhere really upset that we can't exist?",

I was going on the assumption that your grandmother would say \"no, I don't want to have sex tonight, dear, I have a headache\" if she had a headache, and that's why you wouldn't exist. That's why I said that I assumed that you didn't think that marital rape should be illegal. How do you get from that, to \"I had a headache but I had sex anyway, I should have an abortion\"? You are the lunatic who came up with that train of thought.\n\nAnd we are not talking about births. We are talking about not being born. There are millions of reasons why you might not have been born. You being bothered by people who don't exist continuing to not exist is not a valid reason to legislate forced birth, just as it is not a valid reason to allow rape, or incest, or pedophilia. Honestly, I would be just fine with not existing, if it meant that, a thousand years ago, a Roman soldier did not rape a Celtic slave.\n\nPlease read carefully and be sure that you understand before you respond.

Surely you know that if you tell a kid to \"stop f*#$ing cussing\", you are going to be cussed at?\n\nAlso, as as an older adult who cares and wants things to get better, you must be aware that your generation has held political power in the US for at least thirty years. Both as the politicians in office, and as the largest block of active voters. Your generation absolutely has gotten us where we are. And you are too old to get us out. We do not need or want seventy and eighty year old people to tell us how to live today or to lead us into the future. Please enjoy your retirement.",

Neither owns a business, neither could have afforded to pay for my education. \n\nI've never lived in a gated community.\n\nI didn't inherit a dime. \n\nThere was no trust-fund. \n\nI've never so much as set foot on an ivy league college campus. I went to a public university, paid for by me. No scholarships, no college fund. Parents didn't pay for anything. I worked 40+ hours a week for close to minimum wage while going to school full-time. Took additional summer classes for 4 years also. In 4 years I barely had any free time. Student loans paid for any shortfalls in my income. No one co-signed for them either. No parent+ loans. All me. \n\nGraduated summa cum laude.\n\nSo I did, in fact, attend a university. I saw the other people. Most were pathetic. Very few cared about grades, or even showing up to class. Very few applied themselves. Most complained to the professors about their grades, yet did horrible on tests and never did the homework. \n\nI honestly didn't care as none of these people had any bearing on me and my life.

We didn\u2019t spend much else. Lucky.\n\nWe\u2019ve upgraded our home once (4 bedrooms) as we wanted to have a family. We\u2019re in the Chicago burbs. We both make six figures. We are paycheck to paycheck.\n\nMortgage is $2.700 Kid 2 daycare is $2,000/month (age 2) Kid 1 before and after care is $570 (age 7)\n\nWe are stressed, tired, angry. Every raise is just soaked up by inflation. I feel like I have no more money than I did when I was making 50% less a few years ago.\n\nIt\u2019s hard. It sucks. We are lucky. Raising a family now is ridiculous. All this bullshit the far right spews about the \u201cnuclear family\u201d being demolished because of homosexuality, Transexuality, is just the fear monger ing of the elite rich so the idiots who mindlessly vote for them don\u2019t realize the game has been rigged against us.\n\nAgain, we are lucky. We chose to sacrifice in 2007 and not do other fun things to buy that shitty little house. Now we\u2019re about to be 40 and just praying nothing goes wrong with the economy because if it does we\u2019re fucked. We did it right. We earn. We work hard.\n\nMeanwhile my old man never went to college, bought homes, supported both kids and my mom and put my mom through college after we were old enough to walk home from school on a machinist\u2019s hourly wage.\n\nGet fucked anyone who says we aren\u2019t trying. We are. It\u2019s killing us.\n\nMy kids are adorable though. Wish everyone younger than me could confidently enjoy this. I have 4 cousins who are all nearing 30, none even remotely considering marriage let alone a family.\n\nAgain, fuck the boomers who are STILL taking, taking, taking despite having pensions and loads of cash.",

The one that quit the rat race could possibly still work a day job remote, even if not the same pay - there are those that let you care for a child in the home. Although caring for two kids can be it's own job.\n\nNow, that might mean retirement accounts grow a little slower. Or that you might make sacrifices for 4-5 years (that smaller child will be in real school soon). There are other ways to reduce expenses if one person is home (including knocking off the disposable diapers, but that is a commitment on its own).",

It's NOT possible. We want kids so badly. But it's just never going to be in the picture, especially when I can't even get them to give me foodstamps. 20lbs underweight and unemployed. Miscarried 3 years ago and they are trying to give me pregnancy medicaid. Even if you go the route me and my bf are, it's still HELL. they act so oblivious and mentally inept that you feel like you're going crazy just trying to get some money to buy a bag of bread and deli meat. My bf moved from another state and landed a job but we aren't making enough to do anything with. It's all horrible. Awful.  I'm going to end up selling my car to him and getting a track phone. Just so I can be a mom one day. But at the same time, I don't want him working his life away. We want to make a business, but that costs money to start too. The American dream is such a lie and modern days call for modern solution. Yet nothing is fixed no matter how loud the crowd cries. \"Just pray, just hope, have faith.\" I don't want a dream job. I want a dream life. And the economy is in shambles. It drives me wild that places don't just donate. That money sits there doing nothing while there's people like me, IN A HOUSE IN AMERICA WITH A CAR, crying in the bathroom every day because I can't eat and I'm becoming so skinny. My teeth trying to fall out of my head because I can't afford dental. I hate this place and it makes living feel like hell. Hell on earth. It's all so ridiculous and I would rather live in a tribe where I'm trading my animal skins for berries. I'd give up everything to leave this financial hell.",

We can't worry too much about future generations, especially when we can only do so much. Being unhappy doesn't do anything to help them. Changing how you feel is easier said than done, though.\n\nIdk, I tend to be fairly optimistic. I've starved before, and stolen food to get by. My first memory is my dad cutting my mom with a boxcutter. I don't know, I just feel that with some of the shit I've been through I can handle whatever comes in my lifetime. And I *know* that I can do something to help set up my peers, those I have the opportunity to mentor, and (hopefully) my children for success even after I'm gone. I guess I just focus on what is tangible.",

And even asymptomatic carriers are still contagious. Hence the need for testing \"otherwise healthy individuals.\"\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not bootlicking for the government. I'm just big on rules and *technically* this doesn't break them. And I can see the benefit to community health, and there's not really any harm being done to anyone. Not in the case of COVID-19 and most other pan/epidemic case monitoring.\n\nIn the case of women's private health information being shared with authorities because she \"was pregnant\" and is now \"not pregnant\" is fucking harmful. Because if she had a natural miscarriage and didn't need doctor intervention for it, as most don't, then if they accuse her of getting an abortion she has to prove she didn't. And without medical intervention, that's going to be fucking difficult, if not impossible. And this kind of case breaks our normal adversarial law system. Usually the defendant is presumed innocent, and it's on the prosecution to convince guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. In the case of abortion accusations, the defendant is now presumed guilty until the defence proves innocence beyond a reasonable doubt. Which our system just isn't set up for. It's an undue burden of proof.\n\nI feel like this is an apples to oranges comparison though, really. Yeah they're both fruits, there's not a lot of similarities past that point though. Yeah, they're both monitoring and reporting, there's not a lot of similarities past that point though.\n\nThe real key here is the *anonymous* part to the whole pan/epidemic monitoring system. Your infection status is transmitted as part of anonymous data. There's nothing personally identifiable in the data, hence not a violation of privacy, or of 14A. The local health systems were the only ones handling sensitive data, as it should be.\n\nHope my stance on these two issues is clear though.",

Or that you shouldn't take the hair dryer into the shower where you got your hair wet to begin with. Nobody has ever had to tell me not to eat toothpaste.\n\nIn short: I'm not an idiot.\n\nAnd nobody is forcing someone to get an ultrasound to check for a fetus when there's something unrelated to a fetus going on. But nice strawman.\n\n\"Forcing\" someone to get a test for a virus done during a public health emergency is **not even** in the same ballpark as what you just described. They're not even the same sport. Hell they're not even both played with balls. And by \"forcing\" we both know they weren't making people go get a test done. People were being required to get tests done on a regular basis for in-person work, for instance. Or when they admitted you to the hospital you got a test so they knew what protocols to take to protect themselves and other patients. Which also benefited the patient too, since the test can come back positive before symptoms present, also, so if symptoms showed up they'd know how to treat you. But let's turn something into something it's not, why don't we.\n\nThis current shit of politicians trying to take away rights is goddamn horseshit. Justice Thomas literally said he just wants to \"own the libs\" (I'm paraphrasing, but not by much). And I absolutely think his ass needs to be impeached, and we don't need to stop at him. I think Biden needs to expand the number of seats and appoint a few more level-headed Judges. I think we need some Justices that are neither heavily Dem or Rep leaning, but rather tend to be more moderate. Too much either direction is bad. However, that being said, even the \"left\" in this country is still right of center compared to the rest of the world. So I think our entire system could benefit from taking a nice big step to the left. Maybe a couple, even.\n\nBut don't mistake my willingness to submit to some extra testing and thinking that it's okay for them to submit anonymous data on my behalf for the good of public health, y'know because I care about other people, to me being okay with politicians getting involved in people's healthcare and stripping away rights from women and transgender people (they're attacking more than those 2 groups, just focused on those 2 as part of the medical issue at hand.) Why is it okay for politicians to practice medicine without a license?\n\nYeah, like I said, these are not the same arguments.\n\nEdit: words are hard, sometimes, i.e.: grammatical corrections",

Briefly went to college and did 1 yr at community College didn't know what I wanted to do and didn't want to go in debt trying to figure it out so went to work in the trades.  Bought a small cheap house at 22 during peak foreclosure crisis in 2009.  Mortgage was cheap did some refinancing and shortening the loan.  Right now I pay 850 month for loan and property taxes got about 5 years left to pay it off.  Single, work all the time just to pay bills.  Ive been in the house for almost 13 years so this last 2 years have been nonstop repairs water heater, furnace, siding, roof, refrigerator.  The AC took a shit too but im waiting on that. just one after another ate up all my savings.  Pretty much paycheck to paycheck to live.  My disposable income is the lowest it been in 10 years.  There's light at the end of the tunnel but it feels like I haven't gained any ground in the last 6 years and many people have it far worse.  Wanted and like kids but I don't have time for myself let alone manage a relationship and try to raise a family.  I feel like I will be 45 before I have breathing room.  I'm just glad I bought a house back then cuz I would be able to barely afford my same house now.",

Apparently I used this newfound freedom to sneak into the room they were playing D&D in, pad up to the table, grab as many dice as I could stuff in my cheeks, and pad back to my room. I stored the dice under my cribs mattress.\n\nAccording to my parents, by the time my mother figured out, three weeks into my reign of chaos, I had amassed a total of 53 dice, and had stolen dice from all of the 7 players, and the DM.\n\nI actually played every edition up to 3.5 before WoW destroyed my last D&D group.\n\nI also fully lived up to my nickname at the age of 14 months, when I learned how to defeat any lock but a double-key deadbolt at keeping me inside the house. My parents still don't know who taught me the basics of lock picking, but they wouldn't let me near a deck of cards or a bobby pin for years.",

Anything else we didn't have to cook/bake was up for grabs. Mom made sure there were just enough leftovers, made by all 5 of us kids, that we were getting all our veggies, and all our wanted calories.\n\nDad made sure Mom had the money she needed, even if that meant he needed to go to Paris, France, or Kyoto Japan, at times to provide what we needed. He was almost never working from home until a few years after I left for college.

Mostly, we needed the old payphones because your friend would page you with their (pager/home phone) number followed by the nearest payphone number you were supposed to meet them at. Pager number meant they were already there (or on their way), home number meant they weren't and were waiting to hear back. Idk if this was common everywhere, maybe we were weird. The system worked though lol. Anyone else??",

Everyone knew everyone else's phone numbers by heart. It definitely worked until the $.25 cent charge pagers got popular.  Then everyone's parents got mad, because it showed up on their phone bill. One of my friends parents had a jar by the kitchen phone. If you paged someone that had the $.25 pager you had to pay the jar. Then the coded messages weren't that important. Yep HS in 1996.",

I think most people never even upgraded to a digital video camera and used analog up until they could record videos on their phone, and movies were still mostly shot and projected on film up until the early 2010s. Also, even digital displays often used analog video inputs exclusively up until the late 2000s when HDMI started to replace component and a lot of consumer video hardware still allows analog input for backwards compatibility.",

Everyone has struggles, I won't pretend life was easy for them, it's easy for none of us - but it was easier for them than it is for us, and you wouldn't know it to hear them bitch about it.",

Boomers do like to pretend their \"struggles\" were worse, and many like to pretend they did more than their generation really did.    \n\n\nFor instance I always see Boomers try to claim the civil rights movement as theirs, when the movement hit it's peak when the oldest Boomer was about 10 years old.  They also like to claim fighting the Vietnam draft was anything but what it was, which was making sure THEY didn't have to go fight the war personally.  Polling from the time shows Boomers supported the Vietnam War as a generation.",

You bag and move hundreds of pounds of groceries per day. Assist customers with their groceries, and often have cleaning duties as well. That's a lot for $7.25 an hour.\n\nMeanwhile, people that are getting paid $25 an hour are sitting on their asses all day and shooting the breeze with their coworkers.

The minimum wage in other countries actually fucking matches the livable wage, because **that's what the minimum wage is supposed to be**, it exists so that the lowest amount that someone can be legally payed is enough for them to live off of.

Nevermind that familial wealth influences acceptance to prestigious schools and employers. That's too obvious. \n\nHow about systemic racism that's designed to keep non-whites poor by increasing access to social programs (SNAP, Medicaid, WIC, TANF, etc.) and decreasing access to higher education, home ownership, etc.?\n\nWhat about the tax code that rewards those that can afford to have someone manipulate the system, and unfairly taxes those that can't at a much higher rate (wealthy people find ways to pay what often amounts to single digit percentages on their taxes, while poorer people can expect to pay up to 34% of their income to taxes.)\n\nHow about the law. The court system that allows wealthy people to hire good lawyers that get them off on technicalities, while the courts attempt to find reasons to deny free services to the poor. (I was denied a lawyer based on my parent's income when I was 24 and not even living with them. They said I \"had access\" to it, which I did not.) It unfairly incarcerates the poor while leaving the wealthy to treat the law as a minor inconvenience. Which is also evident in the fixed-rate court fees system. Rich people can treat the law as \"It's only illegal if you can't afford to pay the fine.\" Meanwhile poor people who can't afford the fines can end up in jail and/or on probation (which costs you a monthly fee, in addition to still owing the court fees.) Not to mention poor neighborhoods are more regularly patrolled by cops so the poor have a greater chance of being caught breaking the law. Poor POC neighborhoods are patrolled even more than poor white neighborhoods, giving them an even greater chance. Which sucks because poverty breeds crime (like having to steal in order to eat, or someone gets hooked on drugs trying to escape the mind-numbing depression caused by being poor and steals to get drugs, or gets caught buying drugs.)\n\nEducation. Schools are funded based on the regional taxes collected. Which means that schools in wealthier areas are better funded. So if you're poor, and living in densely packed areas, so that they can't afford teachers and there's 35+ kids per classroom.. what the hell kind of education is the average kid gonna get there? Not a good one. They won't be confiding their skills. IF they make it to higher education at all they'll struggle and many will drop out. That's, of course, assuming they didn't have to drop out of high school to get a full time job because their family needs to fucking eat.\n\nPoor people can have trouble getting decent jobs. If there's any indicator that your poor or from a poor background during the hiring process it can make it harder, if not impossible, to get a good paying job. Biases lead employers to think that poor people are dumber, and less moral. So you'll be bad at your job and potentially try to steal from the company.\n\nEveryone does not have the same opportunities, that thinking is deluded and harmful. Please educate and do better.",

Egypt will declare war over Ethiopia's dams on the Nile, and a coalition of Southeast Asian countries are just a few rice harvest failures away from warring with China over their hydroelectric dams on the upper Mekong. \n\nAfter the Water Wars, the Sand Wars. Those will kick up late 2040s. The goal will be for countries that are threatened by rising sea levels to secure sources of river and lake sand for cement. You need sand eroded by lakes and rivers to make proper concrete, and it is a surprisingly rare resource - either you get it from dredging fresh water sources, which ruins your water supplies (see Water Wars, above), or you mine it from ancient, now dry, streambeds. Most of the quarries for this kind of sand are running out, just as we are going to want to build massive sea walls to protect vulnerable cities. So, war. \n\nRight around this time we will also be pushing up against the Phosphorus limit, with most biologically available phosphorus supplies running out. No phosphorus means no crops, so there will probably be some Phosphorus Wars after the Sand Wars. Actually, a better term for it could be the Bone Wars, because one of the last good sources of phosphorous is going to be old catacombs & cemeteries, due to the phosphorous content of human bones. So maybe we end up with states that went through particularly bad Water or Sand wars becoming targets for the Bone Wars to come.",

When the political power is larger than the economic one (i.e. politics state level, all companies intrastate, or political national level and no multinationals) the politicians have the power to strongarm the economic actors into democratic consensus. When the area of its economic actors is larger than the area of political power (i.e. national companies in a pre-federalized US, multinationals in a nation-state world), those economic actors are more powerful than the polity and can not be subjected by democratic will and just strongarm polities into submission and threaten to leave altogether.",

Which is good because if you have a group of insular elites then their interests become completely different from those of everyone else, whereas if you have regular workers living alongside the rest of the community then people's interests are more aligned.  \n\nIf you do this then it doesn't really matter if the territory of an economic actor exceeds the territory of a state, because the power of that economic actor is distributed equally instead of being concentrated into the hands of a single owner or a small group of shareholders.",

I know that's not a popular sentiment here, but intentionally declining to have kids is to disregard the entire biological purpose of our species and the basis for society. Let's say everyone who's currently 28 decided to not have kids. Then the economy starts to decline within a few years and snowballs to a full societal collapse about 20 years later as the impact of no young workers, no new taxpayers/social security contributors, and a declining customer base for food, products and services hits full swing. As the years go on, everyday life consists of a dwindling population of the elderly attempting to take care of each other as they die of pretty much any random thing that can happen to a person -- a fall, the flu, heat waves, etc. There is no effective healthcare, police, fire protection or first responders to assist. And no money to pay for any of it in any event since most every company has gone bankrupt for the reasons discussed above.  \n\nSo sure, it's understandable that some, if not many, people might find decisions that lead to that kind of future unappealing. Specifically when it comes from those who are particularly nasty and smug towards people with kids (see: Reddit users who refer to children as 'crotch goblins' and the like), or who are clearly basing their decision on preferring to enjoy the extravagances of modern society (all of which exist because other people had kids to support it).",

More money is due to not having to pay for child expenses as a DINK couple. More free time for yourself and your hobbies. More freedom means you can travel wherever you want, get hammered on a wild night out without worrying about kids back home. More sex, i mean seriously you can\u2019t tell me it isn\u2019t easier to have more spontaneous sex when there isn\u2019t a kid in the house. This also ties in with the free time argument, more free time to have sex\u2026\n\nAlso I didn\u2019t mention this earlier but you don\u2019t have to share your attention and love with anyone else but your partner. That is huge imo, because I need a lot of attention in a relationship and kids would take that away from me. \n\nI\u2019m just giving my perspective as someone who doesn\u2019t see much to gain from having kids but a lot to lose.",

If I had to bet I'd say there's billions of people who want kids. I don't see that changing anytime soon, even with people online pushing for a childfree lifestyle.\n\nPersonally, I've always made it clear (in datiing, long term relationship, etc.) that I want kids. Not like next week or anything, but as part of my long term life plans. More women than you'd expect want kids too.\n\nI guess my point is that this whole thing is not worth getting worked up about. Plenty of people want a childfree style, and more power to them. Plenty want kids, and as long as everyone enters relationships knowing what they want/expect, it's all good.",

I had a very, very well paying job and when covid hit they fired all of us. (Mind you, I'm a pipe Welder. I was working at oil refineries in Louisiana, I was hardly home which fucking sucked. I don't wanna leave the house any more) so I got the job I currently have because my dad worked here for 35 years, 26 of those years he was a supervisor over production, we make cremation machines. I do all the air pipe on the machines, as well as the hydraulic door and a little bit of electrical. The company has just gon to shit around about the time I showed up (imagine that). I just can't find anything close to the house yet and this company has incredible benefits. I'm \"stuck\" because I'm saving up to get a little further out of this hole. Saving up to get a welding rig put on my truck so I can start doing local welding jobs. We moved into this house, which is a few blocks away from my parents house so I know everybody in my area really well and they are always asking for me to weld something. I just have no means to help out, yet. \n\nThat was kind of all over the place but I hope I answered your question.",

As your mortgage payments have built equity on top of your homes valuation going up! It really is crazy to see these values keep jumping.

I\u2019m speaking for Southern California only but I do know what goes up just come down (at least a small correction). \n\nTouching back on my original point, I see couples with dual incomes over $200k combined struggling to purchase houses as they don\u2019t qualify for any low-to-moderate income programs but don\u2019t have the assets to put down on a home. Very sad to see, and if they do somehow scrape up an offer they are instantly beaten by some cash offer that is $50k-$100k over asking.",

Turns out that if you buy a bunch of bullshit from an angry white man, you end up with nothing at all.\n\nEDIT: Do you know what college cost before Reagan? It was basically nothing. In 1975, Harvard's semester tuition was $175. In 1986, I paid $30/credit hour to attend the University of Florida. The year I graduated (1990), that cost had risen to $250 per credit hour. Today it's something like $1,000 per credit hour. The only difference is that the Federal government changed its policy on funding education. It's not like salaries went up much for graduates or the school got oh so much better.",

Good age spread and a lot of changes happened in the times that we all came of age, and yet here we are, all adults at the pub. I got to talking to them about \"millenials\" because one of them was like \"Oh your not a millennial, for reasons or whatever, you don't want that\" and then they chortled some silly business about not wanting to get their hands dirty and or not working hard or something. I had to remind them that they are showing their age and thats what every batch of old people has said, and the music is just noise too I'm sure. \n\nAny way, it was clear to me that these guys were just not aware, that it was so so much easier to enter the work force in a positive way until recently. Both these guys have explained that they, not being afraid to work, got entry level jobs that let them not be poor. When I entered the workforce my friends Dads building company went from 40 people to 6 who were largely his family. I spoke of switching career from being a cook to a builder for monetary reasons. They didn't understand... why would I quit something I liked? its only money... Well, I didn't be poor any more... and any ole skilled labor job isn't just enough now. Which is why fewer young people want to \"get their hands dirty\" they are aware of what costs are, and what jobs pay, and are making decisions accordingly. The dropping out of school at 15 years to be a success days are mostly over, its not impossible, but its also not reliable",

A normal plan was to go in the military for 20 years, retire with a set income then work another 20 in the private sector for another retirement. \n\n\nMy dad did this. Imagine retiring with 80k a year. Just to focus on raising your family and contributing to the community. \n\n\nMid 2000's was the massive shift. Everything went pro profit for shareholders and cutting costs, specifically worker compensation. Retirement was the easiest thing to kill and force people to put their income into stocks which greatly benefited shareholders through a number of tricks.\n\n\nThen it was overtime pay. This might sound odd but hiring someone full time was actually preferred over having a bunch of party time chaotic workers because it meant you had someone who was invested in doing a good job and knowing their job. Overtime was paying them 1.5 times their normal pay over 40 hours a week which was still cheaper and better than hiring a random worker.\n\n\nWhy 40 hours? Because the fair pay act determined that 40 hours was the limit purple could take in terms of getting an effective worker and not deal with stress issues. That was the cutoff. You wanted people working under 40. In fact, with the fair pay act, people could get away with working 20 hours a week and go to college or extra whatever.\n\n\nNow people can clock in over 40 with differnt jobs and still can't afford their own space. Not including Healthcare and retirement or investing options.\n\n\nBut hey, a few people are making so much money they can retire for several lifespans on less than 5% of what they have in the bank. So that's... Cool....",

But damn I'm glad this support exists.\n\nAlso - many those with better jobs are around my age, maybe a bit younger sometimes and they only get their kids now. We had ours at 27 years, they have them now at 35-40 or so. Makes also quite a dent.",

We're just not good at starting these revolutiones. So feel free to get the ball rolling, most of Gen-X are Libertarian (not the Libertarians used as hate via ignorance of the word... like \"The libs are forcing our kids to drink transsexual breast milk!\" ... but actual Libertarians. *The type that have a good knowledge of freedom, weaponry, and discourse, but minus the use of those things as fap fuel* Libertarians.) We scare the shot out of all political parties. So much so that they convinced MAGA that we, and democrats,  are leftist.

When I finally raised a couple kids myself I taught them what I was taught - you go to school, focus, don't screw up, and things should work out. \n\nThat's about all I see \"millennials\" or whatever expecting. That's what they should expect. Do well in college and get a job in your field, and you should be set. I don't know what else people are supposed to do. \n\nSo it worked out fine for me. My youngest daughter is still in college, on her own dime because she falls in the gap where she's tried to work while going to college, but she makes too much to qualify for any kind of aid or assistance. Apparently she was supposed to just borrow $400k for her medical degree while sitting on her hands at home. Ok, so far she's dealing with that, still working toward her degree and paying her own way. \n\nMy oldest daughter more or less said \"fuck it\", dropped out, and is bouncing around in the gig economy. I don't have much of an idea of how that might work out, but it hasn't done much so far.\n\nNeither one is anywhere close to thinking about kids or marriage. That's for rich folk theses days.",

My house was given to me by my parents.  One of my vehicles as a graduation gift the other my wife\u2019s sister abandoned so we took it.  We decided against kids because of the state of the world despite my wife wanting them since she was young.\n\nWe are fortunate while many others aren\u2019t to have been given what we were and even we sometimes struggle and stress because of how things are, I cannot imagine what it must be like for people who don\u2019t own their own homes or have to worry about kids being out on the street.  I was also fortunate enough to have made enough connections while working those ten years to land a new job that pays less but requires far less of my time and effort, which I can now focus on my failing health parents who sold their home to move onto ours.\n\nI\u2019m not really sure why I posted all of this other than to say just because you\u2019re doing well in some areas doesn\u2019t mean the world is black and white for others and despite having a lot of things others don\u2019t, my family and I still struggle so it\u2019s not as simple as \u201cwork hard.\u201d",

And yet, both also overstep that merit. Those who argue that it was always intended to support a \"living wage\" for full-time workers are correct, while those who believe it should only support part-time jobs for young workers or temporary entry-level positions offer an entirely separate, modern alternative to the original purpose. On the other hand, those who argue that the minimum wage must provide for the lifestyle of a modern American family irrespective of other economic considerations or government welfare programs are arguing for a wage level that far exceeds the one passed under FDR.\u201d",

Not everyone of course... But... Many. Tbh I do think in 5-10 years when we all realize we were just being narcissistic and self inflating we will get tired of being alone/getting taken advantage.

But if you look at the [data](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/USA/united-states/birth-rate), birth rates have been dropping ever since The Pill was invented. Like, literally, there's an initial huge drop in birth rate in 1958-1959, when Enovid became available. It was only approved for menstrual disorders, but people were already using it for contraception. Then, after it was approved for contraception in 1960, it just keeps on dropping. I think it's pretty clear that young adults are incredibly motivated to have sex, but they're not all that motivated to have children. When you give them the choice, they choose not to. And by the time they've decided to have kids, they choose not to have as many as people did in the past. I'm pretty sure that this is the actual explanation.",

We're just very optimistic about being able to enjoy life without kids. \n\nI certainly see the appeal to kids, but I don't think it's worth it.\n\nThe biggest counter-argument is, \"you'll get lonely when you're old\".\n\nYeah that's very true for boomers and Gen X, but millennials grew up online and can always find communities, and when we get old and can't travel and do outdoor stuff anymore there's probably gonna be tons of cool stuff, like if the metaverse takes off.",

Lifting furniture and meat orders getting totally treated like a second class citizen and all that bullshit just to skin the surface I have stories lol..  for 12 years! I never thought I could have kids and was always told I couldn't multiple times... All of a sudden pregnant at 29... The meat shop I worked at gave zero fucks and I couldn't lift anything and they totally treated me like shit.... I had to eat shit for 5 months to get a new job (which I love). Started my new job without qualifying for maternity leave... Because I didn't work there a year.... I love my son and I don't regret having him at all but let me tell you... I added 10,000$ of debt to my plate not to mention the 5,000$ in medical bills just to have him and stay in the hospital... And I still only had 4 weeks off with him and HAD to go back to work... thank God my family has helped me with childcare I can't imagine throwing my 4 week old baby into daycare with a stranger.... And being even more in debt. It's so hard I work full-time and felt like I was paid well but having a baby and providing for them is a lot... It should be a decision... No one should be forced to do this... And you should be paid for leave. This is the heart of so many issues that people need to realize and not be blinded by politics and other BS.",

Not sure exactly when that all got started but I think it was well after boomers where in the work force. I think the colleges started the attitude that led everyone into the \"me first\" mentality and I believe certain colleges promoted the foolish idea that socialism would ever work better than what we have in real practice. Same goes for people who want to make a ton of money off the stupid internet by going viral for something stupid that is most likely totally meaningless. Odds against success online are probably much wose than making it in the movie business was back in the day. There is no more room for meaningless crap such as believing in \"reality TV\" for example so hopefully everyone starts getting more real about what will work and what is basically a pipe dream.

Furthermore no shot in hell we can afford kids either, we both work 6 days a week typically 12 hours a day while barely making ends meet. Past 5 years has been no nice things, we haven't really even been able to afford dates. Only thing keeping us together is our love for eachother, struggling has shown us just how much we can take care of eachother. The sad thing is we will never marry officially, it's too expensive and there are too many expectations. The other sad thing is at my age my parents were getting married and their first kid was already on the way, they were in the process of moving into a 3 bedroom home and in their 20s.",

You know, the way they were when our grandpas worked at a factory how whole life and retired with a pension through the factory and also had social security and probably invested. (Sure, a lot of people during that time screwed up but it sure seemed easier on general)\n\nInflation increases cost of living for sure but maybe the biggest factor in the increased cost of living and stagnation of wages is the fact we convinced half the people in this country to go to work too, increasing the labor pool which drove down the value of laborers since there are so many. On top of this businesses and firms market to households (which are now dual income) and not singular individuals. \n\nBasically we are all worth less than the typical worker was during the 80s or even 90s, but things cost more because mommy works too.

If people aren't having a certain level of kids each generation then the risks to the country down the line are very high.\n\nBaby boomers caused a lot of issues in that regard as after the war it seems everyone was breeding like rabbits which caused a mass population growth.\n\nIt's meant there's been a higher drive to keep having to monitor population growth and why most western countries are having to rely more and more on immigration.\n\nEach generation has had it easier in some regards. I remember my parents explaining they had to use candles and eat cold tins of beans etc to keep up with mortgages.\n\n Few years of severe scrimping and saving until things started to pick up and they were able to start putting the lights and cooker on etc.\n\nA living wage has never been a thing. My wife's dad was working every available hour to keep a heavily subsidised roof over their head with her mum having to work in pubs etc and having to actually knit clothes for the kids and live off things like soup whilst also growing their own vegetables and fishing.\n\nAs generations have gone on these are things of the past. We now have super saver versions of things and live of fast food.\n\nInfancy death rates are their lowest and average life up.\n\nSome boomers benefited from cheaper housing etc but they did sacrifice much more to get them. Literally living like cave people to make ends meet.\n\nWe now have far more new cars being sold, Starbucks around the world, fast food on demand and so on.\n\nEducation was free but it was still a luxury. Most boomers were working from the age of 15 and never had the chance of an education.\n\nUs younger generations only look at how good they had it in some aspects whilst ignoring how much harder they had it in other aspects.\n\nWe can't buy a house because prices soared, many can't afford further education and the we feel the costs have gotten so bad we can't afford to have kids but neither could they without severe sacrifices.\n\nThe vast majority of boomers didn't start having money until they reached midlife to retirement ages.\n\nWe rely on credit to buy TV's, cars, furniture and so on. They literally spent what they could without credit.\n\nEach generation attacks the other generations not understanding we actually have more in common that we'd all like to agree.\n\nForever seeing boomers attacking millennials and millennials attacking boomers.",

The jobs that are available are underpaid and often attacked for one reason or another (like education).\n\n\n\"that generation\" votes against literally any and all changes to the economy that could ease explosive costs of living (things aren't static after decades), we've had several wars in succession since WW2 (the US was never in real danger) that has resulted in more focus on military growth than societal issues (infrastructure collapse, homelessness, Healthcare crises, etc), we just had a global pandemic that punched businesses to death and left tens of thousands unemployed, many of us have given up hope of actually improving things because every attempt is shut down by \"that generation\" that's stuck in the mud (such as making the minimum wage actually a living wage again) and I get to deal with my career being a damn political tool that makes actually doing my job a fucking hellscape.\n\n\n\nBut by all means, must be the pronouns and soy milk. Drop the global depression and global war bs, each new generation just become a punching bag because the previous believes nothing can be better than what they did and the new one is lazy in some form. It's been decades, things have changed old man from when a house could be afforded with a part time job. Fuck, I'm Gen Z, already Gen Alpha is getting some punches at and they're not even high school grads yet, this is just a repeating cycle that even \"that generation\" was jabbed at by their parents, and so forth back to the start of time. I guess we'll just keep everything EXACTLY the same as back then and the rest of the world will just advance around us till the US is in economic shambles.\n\n\n\nOh, and the \"My PrOnOuNs\" shit is a minority of internet attention whores that the rest of us ALSO make fun of and make individuals with casual changes to theirs look like attention whores in turn, like how I could say the entirety of the generation before me were all drugged out hippies screaming about peace while doing nothing to achieve it.\n\n\n\nTelling me to grow up while you keep your eyes shut in nostalgia, lol",

And name brand cloths like $200 Nike shoes and $150 designer jeans. They go out drinking every weekend at an expensive bar. Bought a $2k gaming pc and doesn't even play. Then they wonder how we bought a house first. \n\nMake the sacrifices and go cheap, on everything. Cloths, food, transportation, entertainment, goods, never go out to eat. Shop locally. Move to a more affordable area. (We moved almost 30 minutes away to afford this house) Use food pantries and Thrift stores and online markets like letgo. Cook everything in huge bulk and freeze it or vacume seal it. \n\nWhere there is a will there is a way. I support a family of 6 on 53k and have a house with 2 vehicles and my kids have everything they need. Including alot of wants bc again Thrift stores and market places. Picked up basicly brand new bikes for all 4 kids for like $5 a bike. Make it happen. It's hard and alot of work but it's doable. I'm doing it just fine.",

I didn't do well in high-school and I scrapped by college and worked to pay most of my student debt before it accumulated. I married someone I dated for 5 years prior to marrying them. We bought a shitty house and fixed it up and sold it for 2x what we bought it for and bought  bigger house. Decided to have children after having been at our jobs for years and establishing ourselves and realizing that we will never be just you and I again. I eat healthy 90% of the time exercise 170 minutes a week and have three hobbies to keep myself sane. I grew up in a poor family with 5 siblings two of which were foster kids and we all shared one bathroom. I slept in the living room until I was 15. My parents were abusive and divorced shortly after I was an adult. I dont complain about these but I think if you set goals and stop blaming others for your lack of success and make it happen there will be more millennials with success stories.",

When I look at reports on voter turnout, the 30 and under crowd has an abysmal record. This is a huge missed opportunity. Especially for local (city and county commission) positions. The voter turn out is so low that getting a progressive candidate elected should be a walk in the park; if you know, you guys would fucking vote They are also positions that can effect great change locally.\n\nBut it's just easier for you guys to sit in your custom gaming chair bitching about how fucked up the Overwatch 2 roll is....",

My life has meaning and I don\u2019t want kids - I\u2019ve done and seen great things and had tons of experiences that I cherish. I\u2019ve traveled all over the country, climbed and skied huge mountains and worked my ass off to get to the top of them, gone on epic camp trips in locations I never thought I\u2019d be, seen tons of incredible concerts, made great experiences with friends and loved ones, met some great girls that I loved (though I haven\u2019t found the one yet), generally am happy, and all in all had a lot of fun and enjoyed life. Life is about enjoying it during the limited time we have on this planet before we die and move on to whatever is next (if anything) - some people enjoy the experience of having kids, other people enjoy other experiences. What\u2019s important is we live a fulfilling life and make the most out of the short time we have to experience it.",
