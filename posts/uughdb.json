  "text": "TIFU by disappointing a man who wanted to get laid by a maid\nI'm a professional housecleaner in a large city. My first house today was beautiful and pretty big (4,000+ sq ft.) I had never cleaned this house before today. \n\nIt's kind of interesting to clean the home of people you have never actually met while they are not home. I never snoop but I do learn about people just by the state of their house or whatever is out. These people seemed like they really needed us. I would guess they are busy and don't have much time for cleaning and organizing (but definitely have an active sex life judging by the master bedroom).\n\nI love cleaning dirty houses and was like amping myself up doing a mini Rocky training montage warmup and finding the perfect music to work to (Pantera). I was sweating like 4 hours in but I was getting this house spar\ud83d\udc4fka\ud83d\udc4fling! All I had left to clean were the floors when a man walked in. \n\nI welcomed him home and let him know I just needed to clean the floors and would be finished soon. He looked super confused and then kind of grinned and asked if I was his birthday gift.  I didn't really know what he meant. Maybe his wife scheduled the service on his birthday? I just answered with, \"maybe? Happy birthday, Mr. Henricks!\" To which he looked even more confused and told me his name was not Henricks. \n\nWell. That's because his next door neighbor, my actual client, is Mr. Henricks. I walked my happy ass into the wrong fucking house and cleaned the hell out of it. And then the guy who lived there came home and thought I was a sex worker role playing as a housecleaner hired by his wife as a birthday present. \n\nI was so totally embarrassed explaining myself to this guy and my boss.  (The entry instructions in the app said the client wouldn't be home but that there was a key under the mat. There was no key under the mat but the front door was unlocked \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f). This is not even the first time in my life that I have let myself into the wrong house, although the first time was not a work thing.\n\nOn the plus side, dude was so happy with how clean his house was that I finished the floors and he paid me what my company would have charged him plus a tip!\n\nTL;DR; I disappointed a man who wanted to get laid by a maid.",

I keep my home pretty clean in general, but on \"cleaning day\" where I need to do bathrooms, dust, vacuum, and mop, it's so overwhelming.  I usually burn out before completion.  I think I'm such a perfectionist that when it stops going perfectly I quit.  Like cleaning around the hinges on the toilet lid, i feel like I can never get it clean and just spread around towel fuzz and toilet paper lint that gets trapped around it.  Also baseboards are terrible!  We have a dog, and I am convinced he eats/drinks then places his nose directly against the baseboards and walks laps around the house.  How is one person supposed to clean it all? \n\nI've considered hiring someone to do a deep clean (I moved in to my boyfriends house so Idk when it was last truly deep cleaned) to see if that makes maintenance easier.",

Work high to low, left to right, back to front of surfaces.  I think it's easier for me to be motivated to clean a paying client's house than my own so if it's hard for you to work up the motivation, absolutely look into hiring a cleaner.  Most companies will do a deep clean for the first visit and then alternate some of the duties (like blinds and baseboards) every other visit.  This way, these things are being maintained but the cleaner isn't in your house for five hours.",

It turns out, she had her teen sister housesitting, and she was terrified they were up to something. But, rather than calling the cops or her big sister, the teen hid in a closet most of the day, so she didn\u2019t even know they were cleaning the exterior, just doing \u201csomething.\u201d\n\nNeighbor was confused, because she hadn\u2019t scheduled or paid power washers.\n\nIt turns out, her neighbor was getting her house painted, and the painting company had sent out a team to power wash the house first. They spent all day, in the Florida summer sun, power washing the wrong house. Painting company tried to charge my neighbor, who was having none of it (and she might have willingly paid, but they were jerks about collecting, saying it was all her fault for not stopping the crew, when she wasn\u2019t even there to do so). \n\nThe cleaners had to come back the next day to do the right house. And the teen sister didn\u2019t get more housesitting gigs for a while, since hiding all day was not the responsible solution to the problem.",

Bail is the conditional release of a defendant with the promise to appear in court when required.[1] In some countries, especially the United States, bail usually implies a bail bond, a deposit of money or some form of property to the court by the suspect in return for the release from pre-trial detention. If the suspect does not return to court, the bail is forfeited and the suspect may possibly be brought up on charges of the crime of failure to appear. If the suspect returns to make all their required appearances, bail is returned after the trial is concluded.",

My partner goes back solo and apparently the back doors didn\u2019t make sense on this house. Goofy storage space in one unit made the back doors kind of swap sides. We were in the wrong house and fixed the a/c for someone that is not a customer. Both units had identical problems with a low charge cause the coils to freeze up. No house numbers in the back and the doors basically swapping sides meant that we had like a 50/50 chance of doing things right with the instructions they gave.",

Cleaning the wrong house that is. \nA man who was an existing client who hadn't had his place done for a while called in to schedule a cleaning. \n\nThe maid service went there and started cleaning, they were nearly done when the man called into dispatch and asked where the maid was. They called the maids and said well we are almost done. They went to verify the address and found out the issues the man had sold the house and a new family lived there and the existing key still worked.  The service quickly cleaned up what they had left and left a note and the key with it. \n\nSo the maid service took the opportunity to grow their business by going on a radio show and telling their story and then they made a promotion out of it. \nIf you filled out a form on their website and a way to get into your house they might randomly pick your house to come clean to help fill in any short hours for the maids. \n\nIt kind of blew up and made them popular and they got a ton more clients because of the way they handled it.",

Oh, and it\u2019s a small town, so they know their neighbours.\n\nAnyway, they decide to just let him sleep it off (they don\u2019t have kids or pets), but block off their door just to make sure there aren\u2019t issues.  Wake up in the morning, and the guy has left, but actually did their dishes and reloaded their firewood (without waking them, impressively), and left a note. Turns out he was staying with a neighbour, and both were so drunk the neighbour didn\u2019t realize he\u2019d left to go for a walk, then stumbled into the wrong house and passed out. He came back the next day with a case of beer as thanks for not calling the police and offered to clean up or cook them dinner.",

He just wanted to be humiliated while completing his tasks. I told him that we were all very messy and extremely cruel women, and that seemed to really turn him on. Under no circumstances would anyone that lived or visited our house get naked or physically touch him. He didn\u2019t care! He mentioned that he had many satisfied women with sparkling clean homes all throughout the San Francisco Bay Area if we needed references. I never had the guts to go through with it, but the whole idea of a free housekeeper was extremely tempting at the time lol.",

From a woman\u2019s perspective, sometimes it feels like the division of household labor is automatically gendered, and that we have very little choice in the matter. Maybe she feels like the division of labor is unfair, and views yard work and house maintenance as more of an occasional task rather than more frequent and numerous ones such as housecleaning. Hiring a cleaner would help, but not all of us can afford to do that. For me, I\u2019ve communicated with my partner to try spreading out tasks more equally. For your case, maybe your wife can take on a few cooking nights, while you can take on a few of the household chores like laundry or cleaning the bathrooms for example. Keeping the household tasks up is not easy or pleasant for sure, especially if you have kids and when working full time. I feel your pain.",

She see the work that I do - which is a LOT - including cooking, electrical, plumbing, construction, painting, pool maintenance, landscaping, car maintenance, major financials like taxes, as my hobbies, and so it doesn\u2019t count. I do also contribute to cleaning.\n\nWe have a large old house with acreage and most people in our village outsource a lot. Things break constantly and there is a list of major maintenance items at any time. For example I just built a 300\u2019 fence, automatic gates, regraded, planted 100 trees, mulched 20 cubic yards. It\u2019s a lot.\n\nShe does much of the cleaning, most of the washing, and day-day finances like bills. Childcare is split broadly 50:50. Her hobby is buying clothes online.\n\nShe probably also thinks I generate much of the mess although this is incorrect, she doesn\u2019t tidy as she go while I do.\n\nPlease don\u2019t ask her to cook, I\u2019m a decent cook (people often say I should open a restaurant) and she can burn pasta lol. She hates cooking.\n\nIf we are having a cleaning day I will often pitch in and ask how I can help, for example I might vacuum the house, whatever she needs.\n\nI\u2019m going to try writing up all this before we hire the cleaner because I also need assistance with landscaping, as well as a bigger tractor. Maybe we can understand each other better. Thanks for the advice.",

Also, they can be enjoyed for many years with little to no added efforts. While, up front, these are big tasks, the actual effort to reward is pretty small.\n\nOther tasks, like laundry, dishes, mopping, etc. none of those things really bring any level of satisfaction beyond 'this is a thing that must be done.' Nobody sits back and says, what a beautiful empty sink.  And then beyond that, if you have a family, you know this, 5 gdamn minutes after you put away the last fork, the sink already has someone's dirty cereal bowl in it.  Same for laundry. You can't even get this weeks last load put away before the hampers start collecting again. Someone will spill something 10 minutes after the floor dries.\n\nAs someone who does both the menial tasks and the bigger ones, I know I'm still beaming from fixing the washing machine 6 months ago, and dreading to do the next thankless load of dishes.",

Some do, of course (those riding mowers seem to be ridden by women about half the time).  \n\nI live alone and so does my GF.  I do major repairs on her place -- garage door needs painting or service, windows need repair or painting, roof needs patching or sealing, lawn needs mowing, sometimes even loading the dishwasher for her, which she always dreads for reason unknown whereas I don't mind it a bit.  If I were worried about who was doing the more work, I'd come out on top.  (Not her fault.)",

Took his brand new 85 inch tv, PlayStation, all the games, his watches, Etc. Somehow they decided to not grab all the tools laying around though lol \n\nMaybe a year after that he had his entire huge trailer with nice riding lawnmower and weed eater stolen from the front yard cause he never put a hitch lock on it. It was like 15k. Insurance paid it out of course. He still didn\u2019t lock his doors after that until we moved in together and even now I have to remind him sometimes but overall he does a lot better.",

The only time I consistently locked it was if I was heading out of town to go camping for several days.\n\nSecond place I lived in, different city, was still similar. I had a bunch of roommates, 5 of them, and except for one they never took their keys with them. And one of them had a weird job schedule and she'd come home at 4am. So the door was just permanently unlocked.\n\nThird place I lived was in the same city as the second but instead of a bunch of roommates it is just my wife and myself. We always lock the door even when we're inside. If we go out to work in the yard we lock the door as well. My parents and old friends would probably think we are crazy now.",

I was looking around the house deciding our strategy. Dude comes in freaking tf out, screaming at us even after we explained 5009 times we were at the wrong address. He sent my entire team outside, wouldn\u2019t let them back in to help me carry equipment, and then kept screaming at me to \u201cget the fuck out\u201d even though I had to carry everything myself (several buckets of cleaning supplies plus a vacuum, mop, and broom, and also my supervisor binder) wouldn\u2019t even let me make a second trip. Fucking psycho freak. \n\nKept demanding to know what we were \u201creally doing there\u201d. The company name was literally The Maids. We were driving a company car that was bright fuckin yellow with the name emblazoned all across it, and all wearing uniforms that matched the car. Please use a brain cell dude. I even showed him on my GPS how I typed in the address I was given and how it brought us to where we were. Once outside we were packing up the car to try to get tf out of there and he tried to demand all our IDs and said he was \u201cdetaining\u201d us til the cops got there lmfao. Nah. Bye pal.\n\nThe weirdest part about it was when I was exploring the house (trying to locate all the bathrooms, my sheet said 2.5 bathrooms and we could only find 2) I went down to the basement thinking there was a half bath down there and I came across a room with nothing but a bare mattress on the floor in the corner and a lamp. Nothing else. To this day I wonder if there was a more sinister reason he didn\u2019t want us in the house. \n\nThen we got to the house we were supposed to be at right down the road, and a few minutes later the cops showed up. Rural sheriff gets out and immediately starts swinging his dick around, acting like we\u2019re complete idiots even tho I explained the GPS thing, and acted like I was completely ridiculous when I told him it was standard procedure for us to just walk into a client\u2019s house. Lots of people would leave doors unlocked for us and have us lock up when we left, or they\u2019d leave us a key. Almost all our customers, actually. He wouldn\u2019t believe me until he\u2019d spoken to my manager. Fucking ridiculous. Even the owner of the house we were supposed to be at told him that GPS gets their address wrong all the time, and that several visitors had ended up at the same wrong address. So people had gone there by mistake before more than once and the dude had still refused to believe any of it. Fucking assholes both him and the cop.",

I must say that I realized I'm a little sexist, because once Pantera was in the mix I assumed that a dude was going to walk in on another dude and be bummed that his plan to proposition a female maid hadn't gone as planned.  Ha, ha, ha.  Second, I have to thank you again, because as I'm getting older, I realize that it might be nice to have someone come in twice a month to vacuum for us, but I feel guilty about passing my mess off to someone else and it made me so happy to hear that you love your job.  I fell on my tailbone when I was 12 years old and I've had lower back issues ever since and while it doesn't stop me from scrubbing a shower, toilets, mopping a floor, doing a sink full of dishes, or lugging laundry around, I cannot for the life of me push a vacuum around without being in a ton of pain for hours afterward.  So thank you very much for inadvertently putting me at ease about getting help with some of the chores that are getting increasingly harder on my aging body.  Hope you have a great weekend and week ahead!",

I looked him in the eyes as I brought the mop closer and slowly licked my hot tongue up the pole.  I turned away from him and bent over to get my mop pad  out of the bucket.  My dress was so short, there was no way he didn't see my frilly white panties underneath.  I took my time wringing out the mop pad and knew he would be ready to bend me over the counter if I didn't turn around soon.  I straightened up slowly and turned around to face him.  And that's when he screamed at me to get the fuck out of his house.",

He said \"sorry I was waiting on a friend\" and got up out of the chair, still not putting pants on and came to the door with just the shirt on.\n\nI figured since he was older maybe he had some sort of dementia issue, so I didn't dip out right away as before I've had a really old woman come out completely nude and talk to me about going to the book store with her mom later bc she actually had dementia. So I started doing his service. \n\nI was cleaning the webs out of his eaves and windows when I noticed he was standing there in the windows still touching himself staring at me intensely, once again I figured he was maybe not right in the head. So I was looking to see if perhaps there was another number on the account to call, maybe a son or daughter who took care of them But there wasn't. \n\nI went ahead and started the spray to quickly get out of there and at this point I was sure if it was malicious or not and when I finished I walked out the front gate and the pathway lead me to an area where I had to walk past the door and the rest was covered in plants so there was no way around it. \n\nDude opened the door and asked if I was all done which I said yes too and told him to have a good day, then he has a tip in his hand to give me, I went up and took the tip, it was $50. He said \"is there anything I can do for you? Would you like me to do something for you? I mean *anything* \"Which I declined and said I had to get going. He then became very bold and said \"It's pretty hot out, I can lick the sweat off of your cock.\" \n\nI left immediately without responding and called my office to alert them of what just happened, told them not to send anyone to that house anymore and to immediately cancel the account, my boss called me bc he didn't believe me until I sent him a picture of the $50 tip I had received.",

People who have plenty of money, don't usually have neighbors unless it's a suburb. If that is the case, it's usually part of a HOA, and almost every house on the block looks the same.\n\nThat's alot of hypotheticals, but when reading the post, that's the picture I painted in my head. It would be easier to go up to the wrong house. \n\nWhat I don't understand is why she didn't verify the numbers on the house/mailbox was correct before trying to walk in. Or that she didn't realize she may be at the wrong house when the key wasn't under the mat like it was supposed to be. \n\nAlso some people refuse to lock their doors/cars. Especially in \"nice\" \"safe\" neighborhoods in suburbs and HOAs. Seems really dumb to me but people get complacent thinking they are safe. Having to unlock a door is an inconvenience to them I guess.",
