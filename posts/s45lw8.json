His response was \"Then I should probably punch you in the face to show how manly I am, since that's what men do according to you\"\n\nShe shut up and left.

Also, this small paranoia is a beginning of a more major problem, where all good men turn away from women, and leaving the real bad men (the stereotyped men as per Feminists), will come and no one would be there to save the girls... This is the reason feminism needs to stop, they are also hurting women, not only men.\n\nI would say see the video \"Men-The forgotten Gender\" by Deepika Narayan Bhardwaj, on youtube, that's a Ted Talk. \n\nThere you will get all my proof...

I have personal experience, with this kind of thing, and I think you can't say that its the fault of all men. There are women in there too. And im not trying to single them out. Noone should be going around saying that men cant be assaulted, etc. regardless of whether they are male or female.\n\nIts unfair for you to say that it entirely mens fault just as it is unfair for someone to say that it is entirely womens fault. There is fault at all ends. Im not trying to single out any one side. I was just trying to bring attention to the fact that there is a problem. I never once pointed fingers saying who is responsible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I SUPPORT MEN HAVING EMOTIONS AND GETTING THE LOVE AND SUPPORT THEY NEED. I SUPPORT MEN BEING HEARD WHEN THEY ARE ABUSED.

I honestly can say that I wish women get the support they need, are allowed to feel their emotions, and are heard when they speak up about their abuse.

I should have specified that my main concern is with making sure everyone understands that the construct of masculinity was made by men, because women can\u2019t decide what men should be\u2014 they\u2019re not men. They have no idea what it\u2019s like to be men and never will. Men decide what men are.\n\nI am also glad to hear you have female friends.

It was meant to be addressed as society as a whole.\n\nYou are right.  these have been issues for decades and, definitely before the feminist movement was born.\n\nWe must acknowledge that some men are also crazy and hate women, just as we acknowledge that there are crazy women who hate men.\n\nIf we cant see both sides of the spoon, then we are no better than FDS, and we would deserve the title of a Hate sub. We should be able to understand that not every member of this sub will stand for the same principles as the mensrights movement, just the same way that not all feminists believe in equality. \n\nThere is good and bad on either side, and being biased towards men, makes us no better than the FDS members who cherry pick studies in their favor, and publish biased statistics.\n\nAccept our flaws, for they make us stronger.",

The \u201cfeminist agenda\u201d is actually supportive of all victims of domestic abuse and sexual assault, not just women.\n\nDoes there need to be more awareness and acceptance on a greater societal level of victims who are men and non-binary folks, and in communities other than heterosexual? Yes. \nFeminists are not supportive of falsely accusing men of sexual assault, not only does it undermine those who have actually been assaulted- but it\u2019s wrong. Of course there are shitty people out there who take advantage of the system and people\u2019s sympathies. But that\u2019s everywhere. \nPeople lie and take advantage of food banks and social services - does that mean all poor people are liars? \nFalse accusations and a need for a growing awareness for other victims does not belittle the millions of women assaulted annually.",

Its saying that women are equal to men and shouldn\u2019t be made to feel lesser than men just because they are female. Its saying that women can be just as smart as men (even though they perform better in school on average) or can be as strong or stronger than men (even though they rarely are). Its advocating for equal right. Yes there are a bunch of completely idiotic smoothbrains in there who claim to be feminists when they are in fact saying that women are better than men, but the average informed feminist supports every single point mentioned in this video. Actually they usually advocate for mens mental health to be recognised in society so this completely nonsensical business of hating feminism because there are a few rotten apples in there is disappointing your mothers.",
