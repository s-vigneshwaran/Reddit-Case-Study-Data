You don't earn \"interest\" on the Stock Market.\n\n**Returns** are the valuation of your year-over-year profit or loss from the stock market (technically could consider interest from a savings account a return as well if you'd like). Compound Returns are simply the percentage gained or lost over a period of years on the stock market from Year X to Year Y.\n\nI didn't mean to be pedantic in my response though. In discussions on savings - when referring to \"interest\" - most people mean money earned from savings accounts. When referring to \"returns\" most people mean money earned from investments. I'm hoping to break the line of thinking that people should put their money into a savings account as their primary investment - that's what the banks want, but it's not what's typically best for the consumer.",

Compound Interest - to me - is more stable because you are typically contractually locked into an interest rate, and you can calculate your guaranteed earnings into the future.\n\nWhere as \"returns\" are what you get when you sell your investment. You get your money returned to you - sometimes more, sometimes less.\n\nBut I can see why you'd use the term. Not arguing. Just conversing. \ud83d\ude42",

Trade a rock you pick up off the ground for a more valuable item until you have the startup cash for a business? Theoretically possible I guess. Think you missed the point though. Tools and space cost money. Labor is money. You can make a table for example, and it might not sell for years. When you make high end stuff out of something there is no guarantee it will sell immediately. You think poor people have the extra space or cash to sit on a large slab table until the right buyer comes along? You have any idea how difficult it would be to make said table when you don\u2019t have the proper tools or space to work? Skills? You can hire a guy for the programming of a CNC poor people can\u2019t afford and start cranking out products with another couple of guys that know how to glue wood together. You don\u2019t even need to be involved with anything other than slinging money around. I don\u2019t know what point you were trying to make, but I was only trying to figure out why people are assuming it\u2019s got to be based on some sort of flat, annual interest payment or something. If you already have the spare cash you can find a ton of extra ways to generate money. If you\u2019re poor, any small pittance of extra cash you get is going toward your living situation.

Heck, if you're dirt poor you could even start this with a $100 with the right product. Problem is usually there are babies/children involved and there is simply no time available to do this, so don't get me wrong: I'm not poor-shaming or blaming anyone.

Part of it makes me wonder if they truly do see and know how serious climate change is, along with the resources shortage. \n\nSo they are just slowly gathering all the stuff. But if that was the case we\u2019d see them spending a ton of their money, because if society collapses their money won\u2019t be good. So they better grab as much as shit as they can and say fuck their money if this is their intentions. \n\nI think it\u2019s just their blind and out of touch love for money and power. But if shit hits the fan, their money and power will be useless. They\u2019ll be huge power vacuum going on, and they won\u2019t survive long. Even their million dollar bunkers and money won\u2019t stop people from turning on them. \n\nHell, it might not even hold them safely with climate change causing insane earthquakes as fault lines shift and then there is massive floods and super storms in odd places, super farms that provide a lot of food will get destroyed, and so forth\u2026",

But they choose not to every day. They sometimes spend a micro portion as media stunts and to make themselves feel good, but it's such a small percentage of their wealth that they don't feel any loss. Any real spending that actually is a sizable portion of their wealth isn't coming from their newfound scence of altruism.. it's a veiled power-grab (usually in a \"third world\" country).\n\nSimply put, billionaires and centimillionaires should not exist",

I\u2019m just buying stock from someone else.  Banks lending money to Amazon or customers buying products from Amazon are where the company gets their cash from, not from people buying stocks on a secondary market.\n\nSo if a billionaire has all their money tied up in stocks they are in no way investing with Amazon, they are simply investing in ownership of Amazon shares.  They are providing absolutely zero additional capital to the company, and if they expect dividends, if anything, they are taking capital OUT of the company.",

If there is a high demand for its shares due to favorable factors, the price will increase. If the company\u2019s future growth potential doesn\u2019t look good, sellers of the stock can drive down its price.*\n\nYeah. It\u2019s just that simple.",

They have no interest in closing the wealth gap because the wealth gap benefits them just as much as closing it would, and closing it may hurt them.\n\nThey\u2019d also probably argue that, because their wealth is from stocks, they actually CANT close the wealth gap.

The point we cut people off from Food, Medical, and Rental assistance is significantly lower than the actual cost of living in many areas of the country.  \n\nThe point in which one starts to pay taxes is well below the point of self sufficiency in a majority of the country so you can't say the poor don't pay taxes.   The poor and middle class pay taxes and in most cases pay a much higher rate than I do.  My effective tax rate is less 17.6%, when I factor in sales and taxes that rate drops to less than 10%, many of my employees pay higher rates.  I live on 23% of my annual income, I can afford to pay more than 10% in tax, and everyone in my position should.\n\nNone of what you say changes the fact if you give a dollar to a poor or middle class person it does more for the economy than if you give it to the wealthy.   The last two republican presidents cut my taxes and they didn't need to.  I was doing fine, meanwhile there are 28 million people without health insurance in a country where medical bills is the number 1 reason for bankruptcy (62.1%).   In the wealthiest country in the world 10.5% of households had food insecurity in 2020.

You can\u2019t buy S&P 500 index funds if nobody is willing to sell them.  The majority of all stocks held are stocks that have already been issued and are traded on the secondary market.

Otherwise there are a finite number of stocks outstanding for each company, and you can\u2019t simply buy more stocks unless someone decides to sell them to you.  \n\nIf people stopped buying S&P 500 index funds, nothing would happen.  The stocks would stay at the same price.  How would the price crash?  If nobody bought them, then nobody would be able to sell, and the price would stay the same.  Of course, the stocks would still pay dividends so the index funds would continue to pay out dividends so they would maintain their current worth.",

It's a bit of a legitimized scam.\n\nWhen you invest $600 and end up with $6,000 later, it has nothing to do with hard work, or any real legitimate work whatsoever, or the creation of products or services, especially on the part of the investor. You buy shares in companies or in aggregates  that buy shares in many companies (like  etf's or indexes). In some early cases for young companies the company uses money to make early acquisitions, but in the case of nearly all the established mainstream businesses that make bank, the money paid in just goes to other traders or executives in a personal capacity, not to support the business or product. But due to being public, the company is then pressured to squeeze out as much value as psychopathically possible, railroading customers, the environment, the government and their employees to the maximum extent of the law so that they can repay dividends to their shareholders, or grow the value of their stock. Meaning they aren't really using the input of investors to do anything for the company or product or service; running expenses are paid through gross profits (money they are making from customers). rather, all that investor input does is increase pressure from shareholders for returns, pushing a company to cut and scrimp and save at all costs.\n\nunderpaying employees, skirting environmental standards, ignoring safety protocols, hiding cash in tax havens, lowering product quality, screwing the front lines, worsening customer service, lobbying for slashed government regulations that allow more cost savings and all the shittiest things that modern businesses do ad nauseum... Those are the mechanisms by which stock value and dividends are returned to investors. So not only is investment a lazy means of making money that involves little effort and produces nothing for society, it is  a complicit benefactor in all of the worst business practices we see.",

Whereas a food stamp increase gives the highest multiplier - 1.7, which means $1 in spending creates an additional GDP of $1.70.\n\nSpending on the poor is just *provably better* than slashing taxes on the rich for the overall economy, but we still focus on the tax cuts for the rich. They're shrinking the pie on purpose, as long as they get the biggest slice of pie, they don't care. \"Make America Great Again\"?

In contrast, a poor person being paid $600 and then spending it will contribute much more than $600 to GDP because the entities who get parts of that $600 then spend parts of their share refilling the inventory and reinvesting; for example, someone who spends $5 on a hamburger may provide $0.50 in wages to the waiter and cook, $1.00 in beef to a farmer, $0.25 in rent to the landlord, $0.10 in utilities to the city, etc., and in turn the waiter, cook, farmer, landlord, and city can then take those same dollars and spend them again on other things, recipients can then spend again, and it could EASILY contribute 10x to GDP in one year.\n\nThe most likely reason that it wouldn\u2019t contribute so much to GDP is that the business owner is capturing a the lion\u2019s share of that burger and sitting on it like the fuckin drag on the economy that he is.\n\nFact is, accumulated wealth isn\u2019t a measure of what you\u2019ve contributed to the economy, it\u2019s a measure of what you\u2019ve extracted from the economy.",

The lion share are those that inherited wealth.~~\n\nEdit: Looking further into this that might not be necessarily true and there seems to be conflicting data depending on what amount of wealth is analyzed.\n\nAccording to CNBC, those with a reported wealth of 30 million or more [67.7% were self-made, while 23.7% had a combination of inherited and self-created wealth. Only 8.5% of global high-net-worth individuals were categorized as having completely inherited their wealth.](https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2019/09/26/majority-of-the-worlds-richest-people-are-self-made-says-new-report.html)\n\n[This](https://steveadcock.us/millionaires-inherited-wealth-think-again/) article reports that 70% of wealthy Americans grew up in middle\u2010\u200bclass or lower\u2010\u200bincome households. Even among those with assets in excess of $5 million, only a third grew up wealthy. The article also claims that a study of 10,000 millionaires found that only 21% of millionaires received any inheritance at all. Of those, 16% inherited more than $100,000 and only 3% got more than a million.\n\nWhile it isn\u2019t an overwhelming amount of rich people born with silver spoons, I still think the sentiment rings true that not many of these individuals grew up in abject poverty and those that are older and wealthy, that came from more modest means, could lose sight of how the current generation(s) struggle with poverty, or living just outside of what constitutes poverty. \n\nThe self made wealthy born in the 40s-60s lived through a time when income inequality wasn\u2019t as extreme, when a part time job could pay for college or give you a realistic shot at building towards a downpayment on a house. They lived through a time when becoming a self-made wealthy individual was more legitimately attainable through work ethic and less by chance/luck.",

There is a litany of evidence to support the idea that SES will effect the heritability of intelligence. This is not even debatable in the literature. But you need the genetic potential to begin with. A dud is a dud no matter the environment they are brought up in. There are genius poor people and stupid rich people. My  claim is that the vast majority of poor people (I\u2019m talking poverty level) have poor genetic potential to begin with. Otherwise a long line of genes regarding intellect, would have eventually led them to get out of that Societal class. \n\nIt is highly debated the actual effect of SES on IQ expression as there is inconclusive evidence to support a measurable effect. Some research shows a good effect and others show no effect. \nThey know it has an effect, but they cannot quantify it. \n\nIt is not debatable that IQ is atleast 50% inherited though. Meaning you must have the genetic potential to begin with. \n\nAfter dozens of family lineage, somebody in the family would eventually have the intellectual capacity to escape poverty thus breaking the cycle.

The heritability of a trait is what percentage of the *variability within a population* is attributable to genetics. 50% of variation in intelligence in a population being caused by genetics does not in any way mean that 50% of someone's intelligence is determined by genetics. \n\nFor instance, if we increase education quality and spending the heritability of intelligence will *decrease* even though no change in genetics has occurred.  This is because environment will then explain more of the differences  between individuals in a population. \n\nSo using heritability of intelligence to justify classism is pretty far off base.",

It's (apparently) true that being a millionaire isn't exclusively a family affair, but I'd be willing to bet that a deeper dive shows that a vast majority of millionaires at least grew up with some significant privileges that were a big factor.\n\nFor instance, I clicked through to the source of that study and it seems to be administered by a financial advisement firm. They have a pretty big incentive to convince people that *anyone*, just by making the right moves, can easily become a millionaire. I wasn't able to easily find the study (imagine that, they're happy to promote it but they don't want to make it easy to *look* at it) but I wonder how rigorous it was. For instance, they hit *really hard* on that 21% of millionaires received no inheritance-- did they control for people that hadn't received inheritance *yet*?\n\nBecause it doesn't sound like they did. I know plenty of wealthy people who make enormous use of their family's wealth, but whose parents just haven't died yet. They still get all the advantages of coming from a wealthy family though.",

I also know I am able to pull this off because of my parents money. They paid for school, they help me out after I lost my job and gave me a place to stay while I got another degree. They bought my first new car, gave me most of my furniture for my first apartment. I recognize how much of a leg up that gave me not having debt and letting me focus on everything else.

If you get any extra money, it usually goes toward paying rent or food.\n\nThen there are the lower-middle class people who we might consider poor, but only by financial definitions.

Deeply in debt, trying to achieve the next step on the hedonic treadmill, trying to compete with the neighbours, part of the rat race.\n\nThese are the people who they see and probably mean to refer to. \n\nBut many of them don\u2019t realize that there is a significant group of poor people who are not like the above, and they actually need some help in the form of solid social programs and a fair, living wage.",

Unless someone just gave them $600, were they going to starve tomorrow?\n\nYes, poor people are biased towards consumption.  So?\n\nEvery single person, given $600 or a nickel or a million, has two choices:\n\n1. consume it now (buy food or a movie ticket or cocaine or medical care or whatever)\n2. save/invest it now, with the intent of consuming it later\n\nIn the aggregate, savings and investment *form capital* \u2014 that is, they provide for things that create value in the future: you buy a house that in the future you can live in; you put money in a 401(k) that will invest in companies that make things and itself grow in value.\n\nOn the other hand, consumption incentivize capital formation: no sense making things if nobody is going to buy them.  If everyone consumed and nobody invested, we would soon eat all our seed corn and we would all starve; if everyone invested and nobody consumed, we would starve immediately.\n\nSome people make a huge deal of what the \u201cright\u201d amount of savings versus investment is, but the truth is, nobody really knows and nobody has much control over it anyway.\n\nMy own opinion is that it will keep itself balanced naturally: if there is too much investment, the value of investment will decline and even go negative, and people will stop doing it; if there is too much consumption, the value of even trivial investments will skyrocket.\n\nCertainly, the various government agencies that have developed in various countries with the goal of \u201ctaming the business cycle\u201d have been famous failures.",

Give $600 to a rich person and it's never seen again because it vanishes into passive income. Which is the worse use of $600?\n\nYou have it exactly backwards.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it's great if that money is being spent on local goods and services, based largely on a localized or domestic supply chain.\n\nBut that's not where the money is spent: cheap consumer commodities produced in foreign countries form trade imbalance outflows to places like China, leaving smaller communities poorer.\n\nBy contrast, the wealthy investor who buys domestic stock is spreading their money across the US market by giving thousands of businesses cash they need to grow. The fact that the investment multiplies is hard evidence that the investment is efficient and productive.\n\nThere are big picture caveats (e.g. the entire economy cannot be investments, small amounts of capital take more time to grow, etc) but those aren't related to your prompt.",

But an\u00a0affordable\u00a0pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles. But the thing was that\u00a0good\u00a0boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while a poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and\u00a0would still have wet feet. This was the Captain Samuel Vimes \"Boots\" theory of socioeconomic unfairness.\n\n*Terry Pratchett*",

Hoarding money like dragons never got the economy anywhere. Investment has limited returns, because after a certain point you need to give back, otherwise the investment stagnates, and the value will begin to depreciate. But, here lies the problem. How does one or twenty people spend the wealth of multiple millions of the average populis? They can't. Even if they are incredibly reckless in their spending and always over the top, they still would make hardly a dent in their truly massive fortune. If a billionaire spent five million dollars on themselves every single year and didn't gain any for the rest of their lives, they would be able to live off of that money for two hundred years. But, the kicker is that most of these billionaires are still making money in the background, hell probably enough money to spend a hundred million on themselves and still break more than even the next year. It is financially impossible for these people to redistribute the wealth evenly as an individual, and their investments don't help anyone but themselves, especially with how little they spend for how much they get in return. The only feasible way to really redistribute the wealth is to take it away from them. I don't care how hard you worked for twenty years and how much you busted your ass, it doesn't give you the right to hoard the wealth of millions of people to yourself, so now that even if they worked ten times harder than you for three times longer, they still only get a very small portion of your amassed wealth.\n\nThis system will keep going for as long as these people hold the wealth, and while they will eventually run out of wealth to gain, by the time they reach that bottle cap, they'll have destroyed everything for the sake of their greed, be it through lobbying to allow their pollution to continue without government oversight, to giving them the ability to pay even less than they are now (when accounting for inflation). This needs to end soon, otherwise we'll all suffer the consequences of the wealthy few while they continue to survive.",

If there is money given out, a shark knows what to do with that money than a guppy. Don't you see how much money they have? They think that they are rich because they have the guile to make more money and will use said money to invest in jobs to make more money!\n\nBut the reality is, if they are making money hand over fist, why increase risk by expanding? Why add more workers? Instead, funnel money into lobbyists who prevent tax cuts and regulation that would otherwise spread that wealth and allow you to work the workers you have harder and pay them less.\n\nThen, when prices rise, and taxes aren't being collected because you lobbied and hid your money in offshore accounts, businesses fail and so do governmental structures, such as schools and utilities, etc. Which happen to align greatly with the politicians you gave money to (GOP), as they run on a platform of government not being able to know wtf to do, and look see isn't it true? Well now it would be better run by a smart shark like you, etc.\n\nThe idea is it's a zero sum game to these people, and some people must be poor. There is not supposed to be enough jobs, or money, or access, etc. If you are smart and hard working enough, then you will be able to climb to the top, and if not, well then where you should be. Poor.\n\nThat's why things like giving money to people who need it is so arcane to them. It's cheating the system! Those people don't know what to do with that money! Clearly you're just trying to buy votes. And why do they think that? Because that's what they do  (see lobbyists and politicians above).",

The system is broken, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important that people who can afford to (with time and/ or money) do what we can to help the less fortunate. My wife and I have worked a lot with the less fortunate through volunteer opportunities. Most of them are just normal people trying to help themselves make a better life, but shit just keeps happening to them. It\u2019s harder to realize that they\u2019re just like you and I, because then you realize how quickly a few tragic events could put you in the same place. I urge you to challenge yourself and  view them from a fresh perspective. That being said, there absolutely is a subset of \u201cpoor people\u201d who are mentally ill, and are homeless and destitute because of it. Those people still deserve compassion and help even if it will forever be fruitless and unappreciated.",
