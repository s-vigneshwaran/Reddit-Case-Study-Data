Later, You\u2019re direct reports held a company stripper orGy on company property using company funds. then one of the strippers wrote a book about. This cause great reputational harm to your company As well as resulting in your company losing its most prized accomplishment over the last 10 years. However you weren\u2019t done. You then went on to lie about how apprised employee fell in your lap with absolutely no illegal compensation. A couple years later in the process of trying to fire one of your direct reports you illegally recorded him trying to extort you then turned it over to the FBI causing more harm to your employer.
