Alcohol can\u2019t be sold in over half of states on Xmas. Fuck this theocracy.\nJust got back from the gas station. They can\u2019t sell me beer because it is Christmas and state law prohibits the sale of alcohol on Jesus fucking birthday. \n\nStupid theocracy bullshit.",

          "text": "There are some who interpret certain passages in the Bible as not referring to alcohol, arguing that all positive references to \"wine\" in Scripture refer to non-alcoholic beverages and all negative references speak of alcoholic beverages. Advocates of this view, called the \"two-wine\" position, argue that the Greek and Hebrew words rendered \"wine\" in most English versions are generic terms for fruit juices; context determines if the beverage in view is alcoholic or not. The fact is pointed out that even in earlier stages of the English language, such as in 1611 when the King James Version was translated, \"wine\" could refer to non-alcoholic beverages as well as alcoholic ones. The two-wine view is widespread in conservative Evangelicalism. Dr. Robert Teachout, a fundamental Baptist seminary professor, argued for this position in his doctoral dissertation The Use of \"Wine\" in the Old Testament. Separatist Baptist support for a biblical total abstinence position is widespread. Other sources for this view include the Purified Translation of the Bible, where extensive footnotes are used to promote the idea, and the 19th century Temperance Bible Commentary.\n\nFrom Wiki\n\nI guess Jesus made some bomb juice cuz you just can\u2019t have a wedding without juice.\n\nThey did so, 9and the master of the banquet tasted the water that had been turned into wine. He did not realize where it had come from, though the servants who had drawn the water knew. Then he called the bridegroom aside 10and said, \u201cEveryone brings out the choice wine first and then the cheaper wine after the guests have had too much to drink; but you have saved the best till now.\u201d\n\nCheaper wine was probably just Grape Drank.",

I wouldnt consume D8 Flower without solvent tests, only a small handful of reputable companies are making it safe to consume for flower. I only use it in Raw Disty for quick easy edibles, and occasional vape/dab with terped disty. It still turns into the much stronger 11-Hydroxy THC when you consume it in edibles.

I love the different biomes that really do exist in California and the ability to go from urban to the forest without sacrificing either but that is honestly just for me. If I am honest it would be hard to put down one sole selling pointing for California because many of them are truly up to the individual and that is part of what makes California wonderful. Plus in reality, the truth is that there isn't even the mass exodus that you talked about. Most of the moving was people moving to other places in California some basically just to other parts of the same areas such as from san Francisco to the Bay area which kinda makes sense if we consider the effects of the pandemic and how it has affected moving patterns. For those that did move, I hope they did find a good place though that fits their needs because to be honest I would rather we improve as a country than compete as state versus state rivals.

Even making a low wage, you can still stash away a considerable amount of money if you don't have to pay rent to some land baron. You save tens of thousands which can then start earning interest, or put into stocks or retirement accounts.  \nA family working together and pooling resources could save enough to buy a big house where everyone gets their own space, or save so that every kid gets their own starter home.   \n  \nInstead, we have a bunch of dysfunctional families where kids are just seen as a burden or treated like property, or are made to live under overbearing puritanical rules, and the kids want to get away as soon as possible.   \nI've know *so many* people who were willing to pay 50+% of their income so they could get their own place *just* so they could have somewhere to have sex.",

Could be talking out my arse but pre-industrial there was a lot more need for families to stay together to survive, as western society developed young people had a lot more options, which was a great thing, but it feels like for most people it has now become a social requirement to leave home when you are of age which I think is unhealthy.  \n Especially for people on the lower end of the economic scale staying home to provide and care for our parents is going to become a requirement more so than it is for some people today. Look after your kids because they'll be the ones looking after you.",

These clubs often have either high membership fees or dues, or a referral process, or pretty much any other way you can think of to keep poor, and especially brown, people from gaining access to them. And of course, all of the judges, shop owners, liquor commission members, sheriffs, or whoever else are members of the club, so they certainly aren't going to do anything.\n\n\nIt's all especially ludicrous because anyone with an actual substance abuse issue is either going to have plans and stockpiles in place already, or they are going to end up driving across two counties half in the bag to score after running out.",

When I asked for the mojito, I pointed to the menu. I was told \"sorry, it's Sunday,.we aren't allowed to serve alcohol on Sundays.\" And my best friend, who we were visiting, said \"huh, that's just weird. But makes sense\". His wife - who is VERY Christian - said \"it's because the laws here. NO alcohol served or sold on Sundays, all day, because 'it's the Lord's day'. If we went a county over, you could get served there.\" \nSo it was a combination of county lines and religious based laws prohibiting the sale of alcohol on Sunday.",

Religious holiday, government holiday, your birthday, or any other reason doesn't matter because society literally doesn't get to stop for holidays.  \n\nYou really can't use the \"everyone has it off though!\" argument. If your Grandmother suffers a heart-attack during Christmas dinner I'm willing to bet you'll want 911 to answer, for EMTs to be on call ready, and especially for that ambulance to not run out of gas on their way to you or to the hospital. \n\nIt sucks, I know that personally because I work a LOT of holidays everyone else has off. But when you choose to work in any industry that is a society cornerstone like health, safety, fuel, power, food, water, transit, etc. You often don't get the luxury of holidays just because \"everyone else does!\"",

Kentucky and Arkansas are the two states with the most alcohol prohibition in the nation, and Kentucky's gotten progressively wetter (with a lot of cities and counties now calling themselves \"moist\" or \"damp\" - allowing alcohol sales in restaurants even if they don't allow liquor stores). This is probably due in a big part to bourbon being part of Kentucky's economy's backbone, providing tens of thousands of jobs and billions in state revenues.\n\nArkansas... hasn't moved nearly as much. Nor has Mississippi (#3 on the list). And then you have a *lot* of states with heavily mixed prohibition laws like Kansas and Ohio, where you basically have to be a local to truly know when and where you can get a fucking beer...\n\nOn the other side of things, there's the West Coast, which truly does not give any fucks.",

In my second attempt at gas station #2, the attendant explained to me that the rule maker ( a commissioner??) for the county is a \"bible thumper\"; however, progress has been made because 5 years ago they were completely dry. It sucked, and as an outsider I was fine with the local rules, but why I was met with aggression for asking why I couldn't buy beer was eye opening to the culture. All good though because the big jC and I are cool and turned my water to wine.",

My ex wife got super religious after the birth of our first child and tried to totally upend our lives with rules handed down by the church that didn\u2019t exist in their bible. When I wouldn\u2019t comply, one of her new super-evangelical friends - you know the type, always on fire for god, steers every conversation back to religion - tried to lecture me about how I shouldn\u2019t touch alcohol or associate with non-believers. \n\nI asked him how he came up with that, given that Jesus served magical wine to the multitudes and counted prostitutes and tax collectors amongst his friends. \u201cWhere in the Bible does it say that, bro?\u201d He fucking had nothing. So I lectured him right back on why he wasn\u2019t following the teachings of his own holy book. It infuriates me how none of these people read their own holy book and try to force us into compliance with their made up rules.",

It's a crazy new invention where you get to pick the people you want to represent you and make the laws that you live by.  And if no one fits the bill for your particular brand of freedom, you can jump into the arena yourself and see if you can convince enough people that you'd do a better job.  The primary stipulation for it to work being that you need to participate in all of the elections you are eligible for at minimum, not just the \"big\" ones (the president of the United States does not control your local liquor laws).  You can dive in to politics as deep as you want, but voting is the easiest way to make changes happen.  Also, keep in mind that politics is like a bus ride.  It's going to be a slow trip and won't take you exactly where you want to go, so you gotta choose the best route that gets you closer to the future you want to live in. \n\n\nAnd, if you are a regular voter and it's still pissing you off, figure out what office has the power to change that law, then volunteer for the candidate that wants to change it.  The beauty of America is that you can get as involved in the process as you want.  I highly recommend it to anyone eligible to vote!",

A person who knows he or she might drink too much can make a decision before the drinking starts and can\u2019t go on an impulse beer run after a few drinks have started a process they have a hard time stopping by themselves. This saves a lot of suffering for many people, especially children. \n\nFuck Jesus\u2019 imaginary birthday, but a little less drinking on holidays is actually a good thing. If you can\u2019t be without beer for one day of the year, the problem might be with your drinking rather than with religion.",

They are actually celebrating for a pagan god. (Which for someone who believe in triune God is a great sin to worship other god.)\n\nAlso, Paul specifically exhort Timothy to drink wine. I am a person that didn\u2019t drink alcohol (until I bet with my wife saying that if Trump lost I\u2019d celebrate by drinking champagne.) But it wasn\u2019t for religious reason, more about family history. I wouldn\u2019t dare to make up something and take Bible out of context to prove that drinking alcohol is bad.\n\nAnyway, there\u2019s many who claims to be Christians who don\u2019t even read the Bible and understand it\u2019s doctrine. Had I been raised in the US I probably would be atheist for this reason too. Honestly I\u2019m very surprised at what Christians and evangelicals stands for in the US.\n\nP.S. but theology in the US is great. Great seminaries, great publishers. But there\u2019s a huge disconnect between the theologians and, you know, those christians that made the news.",

It's an effort to help reduce drunk driving incidents. Has nothing to do with the whole Jesus thing. \n\n>BUT YOU CAN BUY ALCOHOL THE DAY BEFORE AND THEN DRINK ON CHRISTMAS!!!!! \n\nSo because it's possible to get around these restrictions we shouldn't bother doing *anything* to reduce these horrifying numbers? If this helps even a little then it's worth it. Maybe you should look into why you're so angry over not being able to purchase alcohol on a holiday. I'm glad you weren't able to buy any.\n\nAlso, don't fucking shop on Christmas. That's why these stores are open and you're part of the reason its employees can't go home. I had to work on Christmas once at a bowling alley and it sucked. Everyone came in saying \"OMG why do you have to work on Christmas?!?! I'll play 2 games and yes I need to rent shoes.\"",

Oh well.  \nMost people probably assume it's a workers' rights thing, like Sundays where all the shops are closed as well.",
