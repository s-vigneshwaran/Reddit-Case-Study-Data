If someone asks you if you're alright after slipping, it means you're ok. If someone asks if your car is working, it means it's running fine. If the waiter asks if your food tastes good, it means yes. If you're posing for a selfie with Richard Spencer at an alt right rally and/or marching next to a guy with a Nazi flag of some kind, no one thinks you're saying \"I'm ok\". If you're a far-right public figure and you're doing it slightly subtly in the background of a picture but obviously doing it intentionally, you're obviously signaling support for white nationalists, or at *best*, don't mind that they think you're on their side.\n\nIt's not difficult, don't play dumb.",

Again, context. If you hold it up when someone asks if you're ok, you clearly mean you're okay. If you're a neo-Nazi with a history of saying white nationalist talking points and you flash it like a gang sign while happily taking a selfie with Richard Spencer, you're using it to signal your \"membership\" of that group.\n\n> I mean if we follow your logic, we shouldn't be allowed to hug those we care for because of it's proximity to bigotry\n\nExcept you're no \"following my logic\", you're just being absurdist and pushing a dumb slippery-slope fallacy. Your first statement is correct - \"it's not difficult. Don't be dumb\". So why are you taking it from something extremely obvious to being explicitly dumb?",

It doesn't matter; you're doing something on purpose with the intent to fuck with other people. It is absolutely his fault that people think he's acting as a white supremacist dog whistle as a result of him using that sign in the way he did.\n\nThis is equivalent to a scenario in which someone walking past you randomly insults you, then you get angry at him, then he says \"SEE I JUST EXPOSED THAT EVERYONE GETS ANGRY WITHOUT ACTUALLY KNOWING MY ACTUAL INTENTIONS!\" You have to be some kind of special psychopathic r-slur to believe this makes sense. \n\nLots of people in this thread coping by saying reddit is a containment zone when it's actually the other way around. Reddit is like the 7th most visited website; it's used by pretty much everyone. 4chan is a niche safe space used by people who think getting banned for harassing others is a violation of their free speech. It's literal insanity waiting to be put in prison. I honestly would not be surprised if a good third of all 4chan users have or will be in jail/prison at some point in their lives.",

It's just a fun thing they do when they hang out with other racists people.\" \n\nThe really dumb thing is that any time you see a post of a 4chan thing triggering someone, there's about a 50/50 chance it's just another 4chan user acting upset to troll other 4chan users.",

A lot of the immigrants back then actually were specifically brought over because of their math skills, who passed its importance to their children, which continues to this day.\n\nculturally yeah asians get bashed on all the time in the media and on the internet, particularly asian males.\n\nit wasn't until fairly recently that i realized how many asian women get cast in movies and TV but you rarely ever see asian males, and that's only because someone else pointed it out.  It's actually kinda creepy once you start to notice it - you see A LOT of asian girls in teen/young adult shows but it thins out as the target audience shifts older.  and it's a unicorn to see asian males in any significant role in the media.",

There is no speculative value, it's very much all practical. They can jack up prices as much as they want, because we can't move to a competitor,either because prces are all the same or because of the technological limitations. And it's not like we're gonna make our own ink (I think the printing machines would even prevent use of that) though I would love nothing more.\n\nThe issue with NFT's is, that it's much more of a speculative bubble. People really just HOPE that someone will want their NFT in the future, which for vast majority of NFT's is just not gonna be the case. Most of the succesfull NFTheads are small minority, already established popular people, companies or artists (like that one NFT art that was compilation of all art by famous painter that started it all).  \n\nMost of the NFT's sell (if they even sell) for about as many bucks as a hentai commision. Which considering the price to even make one is not very cost effective.",

The \"value\" comes from a bunch of things - who was the artist, what was going on in his/her life at the time, was the country in turmoil when it was created, is it unlike their other works or otherwise unique in some way, was the piece stolen by Nazis and recovered etc etc. You only get that stuff with the original, and I think all those \"markers\" can apply to NFTs as well (at least in some degree).",

You buy an entry into a ledger with the sole purpose of selling it on to someone else. It's tulip mania.\n\nDoes that mean some people won't get obscenely rich from it? No. And good for you if you're one of them but don't pretend it isn't a solution in search of a problem and the only thing it's currently used for by any significant volume is a speculative economy largely by people who, hilariously, think they're not participating in speculative investment.",
