Like I was just pulling the corners of my mouth to the side and not up, and squinching my face- nothing that necessarily conveyed happiness to anyone watching.\n\nBut it's just muscles after all, right? When they haven't been used in a long time they get weak and twitchy, just like what you're describing. I ended up actually practicing in a mirror for a while, because that's what you do with muscles that are out of shape- you exercise them.",

Get a haircut - kid doesn't have to loose the long hair but he should pay good money to get it styled by an actual professional.\n3. See if a beard will grow in and look good or not.\n4. Lift.\n5. Get some decent clothing. Nice button down or polo shirt with decent fitting jeans and not the Jnco I'm sure was a hand-me-downn from his uncle.\n6. Patience. If he keeps lifting, saves his money (get a job, NEET), let's his hair get styled by a professional he will be in man-bun stud city. Everything takes time, consistency, and persistence. The changes will come.\n\nI will add these other things as well:\n\n- I once heard Jordan Peterson say to young men: \"try really hard at something for a year and see what happens\". Get an instrument. A guitar is fine but a piano is better. Save some money and buy a Yamaha P45 + headphones and \"Alfred Adult All-in-one Course\".\n\n- Pray. If you're an atheist, think of it as meditation. Sitting alone in a room with just you and your thoughts for ten minutes.\n\n- Read. Good adventure fiction like Tolkien, Lewis, Herbert. Philosophy, theology, war autobiography will all build character.",

I put in the work she suggested for 3 months. \n\nIt's hard to find brand new things to do every single week.\n\nI tried shit I've never done before.\n\nBaking. I tried exercising. I tried hiking. I tried bowling. I tried going to a movie and restaurant by myself.  I tried sitting at a park and enjoying serene peacefulness. Tried reading even though I knew I already hate reading. Tried new music.  Tried learning piano again.  Went to my grandmas and told her to teach me guitar. Tried talking to new people.   \n\nI put in the work she recommended I do. I tried new things.   \n\nIt didn't change my mood or outlook at all.  I was still depressed the entire time I was doing it.  \n\nI've been jogging for over a year now.  \"Start exercising it'll help your mental health sooooooooo much!!!!\" \nI jog 3 miles 3-4 times a week. Is my mental health sooooooooo much better now? Nope. I'm still depressed. \n\nPoint being exercise and therapy isn't a catch all cure to solve people's problems like reddit seems to think. \n\nI'm depressed because I'm not a cute 16 year old that got tons of attention like I used to be. I'm depressed because I have a bachelors degree in cyber security and I've worked tier 1 help desk for 5 years instead.  I'm depressed because I've been applying to jobs since 2019 and I either don't get an interview at all or someone more qualified than me comes along.  I'm depressed because I got dumped after a 6 year relationship that I dedicated my life to. I'm depressed because everything I've once had in my life that was good is now gone. I'm depressed because nothing is permanent.  I'm depressed because after being alive for 26 years I still can't say I've found a hobby that I genuinely love doing. I'm depressed because  me and my sister used to be best friends but now she's a 30 year old woman with responsibility not a 16 year old girl who can spend all her time being vain and hanging out at the mall with me and take scene myspace pics tohether . I had a friend since I was 3 years old and we would sleep at each other's house every weekend. Summer vacations I'd literally never even leave his house I lived there for 3 months because we always wanted to hang out. Now we're adults. Adults don't do that.  And he's in the army so we can't do it.  And even when he wasn't in the army we didn't hang out as much because we just went different paths. Now we just talk on the phone twice a month for 20 minutes.   \n\nTherapy doesn't cure that. Therapy won't make me 16 again. Exercise didn't make me stop thinking about any of that. Trying new things all the time didn't make me stop thinking about that. Exercise and therapy didnt make me feel the same way I felt when I was 13 hanging with this girl and just listening to music together all day without any responsibility in the world. Exercise, therapy, or being adventurous won't bring me back to the days where me my sister and my mom would have family night and watch reality TV shows on MTV like room raiders or next or parental control or flavor of love.",

However, I do think that if psychiatric treatment is a possibility for you, try that route. A lot of times therapy itself will suffice, but with how long it's been going on and how deeply it's affecting you, it can't hurt to try. Biochemistry can make a lot of what you tried to be successful meaningless, and for what it's worth, I think your therapist could've done a better job in setting expectations for this process. Best of luck to you, hope that some better days come soon.",

If you\u2019re in a state of anxiety caused by the idea of people constantly criticising you without any reason to truly think so then you do have an actual \u2018illness\u2019 and should see someone about it, you\u2019re the .01% I allowed for.  If it\u2019s the fear of never being good enough then you should see if it\u2019s caused by a lack of approval from your parents/role models growing up. If that is the case then go to them and sort the problem - it doesn\u2019t necessarily need to be face to face or verbally. \n\nDo you talk with your \u2018bud\u2019 about these fears/issue you have? Public confession of fears and anxieties tend to push them into the past.\nIf you\u2019re worried about what people you know think, just ask them/tell them about it.",
