The board only began saying the Pledge back in April, but the faux-patriotic ritual didn\u2019t go over well with some members of the community who called out the unnecessary injection of God and the lie that we have \u201cliberty and justice for all.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, board member Seth Holden explained in detail why beginning their meetings with what\u2019s essentially a Christian prayer violates the district\u2019s commitment to inclusion and diversity, urging his colleagues to get rid of the Pledge:\n\n\u201cGiven that the word \u2018God\u2019 in the text of the Pledge of Allegiance is capitalized,\u201d Holden said. \u201cThe text is clearly referring to the Judeo-Christian god and therefore, it does not include any other [faiths] such as Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, all of which are practiced by our staff and students at FPS.\u201c\n\nEven Atheists and Agnostics are excluded from the pledge, Holden added, saying it is a \u201cnon-inclusionary act\u201d.",

It is not a united group of people, simply those that do not believe in some being or beings that created or rules the universe. \n\nI know that it is very hard for those who have religious beliefs to understand that there are those that can stand on their own two feet. Take a moral position that comes from genuine understanding and sympathy  in a fellow man. An understanding that 'fellow man' is those of all sexual and racial persuasions. \n\nIf you cannot understand this point of view I would suggest that you pray to your imaginary sky god for guidance  and, until you have an actual reply, be silent.",
