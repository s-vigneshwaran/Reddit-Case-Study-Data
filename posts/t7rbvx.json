It's actually that different strains circulate every year, so they have to \"guess\" which strains to protect against in the vaccine. There are occasionally new strains too (i.e. swine flu was a new one) but that's much less common than it just being different strains that already exist suddenly becoming more prevalent.",

And, again, you can't spread a virus that you're not infected with.  Thus the vaccination lowers transmission rates as a byproduct of lowering infection rates.\n\nIt doesn't **prevent** transmission, because the word \"prevent\" means \"stop completely\".

They are required for genome replication and are shared by many coronaviruses. So if what Montagnier said is true, the whole family of coronaviruses \u2013 which originated over 10,000 years ago \u2013 would have to be lab-made, and this is obviously nonsensical.\n\n>Many experts have already pointed out this obvious flaw in Montagnier\u2019s argument. As \u00c9tienne Simon-Lori\u00e8re, a professor at the Institut Pasteur in Paris, said, \u201cIf we take a word from a book and it looks like another word, can we say that one has copied from the other? This is absurd!\u201d\n\n>It is surprising to have a scientist of Montagnier\u2019s stature utter such questionable statements \u2013 although Montagnier himself is a controversial figure. Among other causes, he has supported anti-vaxxers, homeopathy and a silly claim that DNA emits \u201celectromagnetic waves\u201d.\n\nI'm guessing not!",

Presumably because you figure no one will read it and so long as you provide links to anything, people will then blindly believe whatever you say, no matter how unsubstantiated.\n\nThe exact thing that you made a claim about, and which I asked for proof of, was you saying that according to Luc Montagnier, people that have received the booster shots would test positive for HIV. You've been unable to back that up, because the proof to that would be you providing a source of Montaginier saying that people who have received the booster would test positive for COVID (the second part, of course, would be if Montagnier has evidence backing that claim up). And it seems that you can't back up that claim, as none of your three links back up the claim you made.  \n\n1. Vague claim of his about similarities between the virus itself and the HIV virus; that does not in any way shape or form say that someone who gets a COVID vaccine booster will test positive for HIV.  \n2. A video discussing COVID infections in people with AIDS because immunocompromised people may be host to more mutations. Nothing to do with Montangnier, vaccines, or those with vaccines testing positive for HIV    \n3. A video that has nothing to do with Montagnier about a vaccine that no one ever received a booster of. Zero relevance.  \n\nOne could wonder what personal motivations someone like you has to be that deliberately misleading. One could wonder if you're paid for your misinformation, or you merely have indirect financial benefits in spreading misinformation. One could wonder just how far your connections go towards the top for you to be this involved in misinformation. One could wonder how many sinister societies you have connections to; how often you go to Bohemian Grove and Bilderberg, what branches of the World Bank you are affiliated with, and how long you've been a member of Skull and Bones. One could wonder all sorts of things about you based off your deliberate attempts here to use the mainstream media sources to propagate lies about COVID.",
