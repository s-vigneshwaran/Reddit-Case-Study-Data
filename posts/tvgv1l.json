Many of them turned to crime, organized or otherwise but most of them just worked hard(for extremely low wages). They were basically the equivalent of mexicans. In that era, being racist against albanians was not only socially acceptable but the norm. \n\nAlbanians eventually integrated into the greek society. They were one of the main factors of the late 90s/early 2000s economic development of Greece. Albanian mafia is still a thing though.\n\nFun fact, the most common racist slogan against albanians was \"You will never become greeks\". Which is funny considering that now racists complain about how the new immigrants(pakistanis, africans, whatever) suck because it's hard to integrate them into the society.\n\nThis is a very short recent snapshot of the issue. As always with the Balkans, there are centuries of history which complicate things. Albania has some claims over greek territory and vice versa. Minorities of each other exist in both countries, often get oppressed or slaughtered, you know typical balkan shit. But for the most part, the relationship between these 2 countries is kinda ok now.",

Like that republican that went on Fox News and a host asked him why he would cut social security and Medicare (which is deeply unpopular even with Republicans) and the fucker said \"I'm not doing that!\" and even the *host* thought it was bullshit and said \"It's right there in the bill that you wrote.\"\n\nIf some people who didn't know anything about politics or have any political leanings saw the shit he does, they would go \"I don't understand, how did a guy who actively and openly works to make it worse for almost everybody in his state get elected?\" You fucking smooth brains are so far gone that you can't even see it even though he doesn't hide it at all.\n\nHe's trying to wage economic war on fucking Disney of all things because the company said they didn't like a bill that he passed. Using his political power to attack a private company because they don't agree with something he did. He's a fucking authoritarian, and not like \"oh noooo Ted Cruz cut taxes for rich people!\" but an *actual real world* \"Using governmental power to silence opposing political entities\" authoritarian. He's one of the worst people in all of the American political landscape and you shitheads *like it* because in between you getting shit on, he also shits on people you don't like.

How does Desantis proposing legislation regarding education about transsexuals makes the online behavior of the people in the movement less attention whorish, given that it doesn't really help change public opinion?              \nFurthermore, while transsexuals are often used as boogeyman in policies, it should be noted that the policy that's under blast right now is mostly about decreasing the reach of the movements in younger demographics through state means. While the problem the bill combats probably is overblown, the bill itself is also a far cry from any LGBTQ extermination bill. I understand that it's a slippery slope, but it really feels like the movement isn't under attack as harshly as it claims, and that a lot of animosity against it comes from the movement increasing it's reach every time it consolidates itself on a certain position. Claiming so when people don't see it that way also doesn't help.",

He's mocking how you dismiss any Republican policy with reductive strawmans. Of course Republicans have policies, you can just search them. \"Job creation\" is as much of a policy as \"Clean energy\". Also, how can you think excluding the last president policies is a reasonable demand? Even if he's divisive in the party, he does represent a good part of the party.",

It may have been one of my favorite days in the past few years if im being honest. Watching transcel/neckbeards implode on live national TV is one of the greatest things a person can experience.\n\nAnd the aftermath of it? Oh fuck, that was better then anything ive seen on 4chan. Watching people try to rationalize why they allowed themselves to be represented by that thing was amazing.",
