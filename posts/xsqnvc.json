Like it's absurd to think anything else. Evil asks you to believe in it without understanding, asks you to believe despite it feeling wrong. Truth does not, truth stands there shining on a hill regardless of whether you believe it or not. It's like the simplistic exercise of finding who speaks for God and who speaks for evil, who asks you to think and who asks you to believe. It's why I think Jesus was a composite character because at some point he asks us to think, like when he says the bit about two commandments or mote in the eye, we aren't asked to take these lessons on faith because they make sense and can be seen to be rooted in truth, but then at a later point Jesus goes all \"I am the way none come to the Father except through me\" and it's like mmm ok dude that sounds like an asshole talking again, where was the earlier guy who spoke a bunch of plain sense and didn't make it about putting aside that sense!!\n\n\nSorry I got a bit long winded but the point is that only evil would come up with something like the unforgivable sin. (And by evil I don't mean some universal evil like the devil, which does not exist, but simply the vain pettyness of man willing to lie and manipulate others for personal gain)",

As a Biblical storm, it has been sent by God to punish sinners. \n\nRon Desantis used the wealth of Florida to send away the Texas migrants, Flying them first **from Texas to Florida and then sending them away to Martha\u2019s vineyard.**\n\n**A reading from Matthew beginning at chapter 25, verse 41**\n\n\u201cThen the King will turn to those on the left and say, \u2018Away with you, **you cursed ones**, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his demons. 42 For **I was hungry, and you didn\u2019t feed me. I was thirsty, and you didn\u2019t give me a drink. 43 I was a stranger, and you didn\u2019t invite me into your home. I was naked, and you didn\u2019t give me clothing. I was sick and in prison, and you didn\u2019t visit me.**\u2019 44 \u201cThen they will reply, \u2018Lord, when did we ever see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and not help you?\u2019 45 \u201cAnd he will answer, \u2018I tell you the truth, **when you refused to help the least of these my brothers and sisters, you were refusing to help me.**\u2019 46 \u201cAnd they will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous will go into eternal life.\u201d\n\n**The Word of the Lord**",

How are you going to force these people to love and properly care for a child they didn't want? Have you educated yourself on the studies done in regards to neglected and unloved children? Have you followed how critically overwhelmed the foster care system has become? What's your plan to solve that? Add more unwanted children?\n\nYou're teachers handed tests back to you face down alot huh?",

If you read the constitution it clearly states that powers not specifically enumerated to the Federal Government are reserved for the the people, OR THE STATES.\n\nEven liberal scholars have long admitted that Roe was bad law, and never had any legal basis in the Constitution, and should have remained a State issue. If the people of a State want to ban abortion, that's their right.  Just like a State that wants to allow it.  No one is forcing a woman to live in a State that bans or allows abortion.  They are free to find a place to live that suits them.",
