Or is it more one important aspect of the movement. I feel like we look back at violent acts in the past and are able to understand their importance for the movement but seem to be convinced there can't be a legitimate reason here and now.  I just listened to the stonewall uprising on Your wrong about and i think we have to agree the \"violence\" here was more than justified and did not hurt the movement. \n\nIn my home country the socialist workers party and the conservative economics party did fight actual war, if the socialists wouldn't have had resorted to violence than, we maybe wouldn't have the social democracy we have now with their strong worker protection and strong social welfare.\n\nI feel like the left needs to let go of their idealism a little. I admire that people on the left are truly convinced about what they believe in and avoid hypocritical behavior but this weakens the movement overall.\n\nIt doesn't really matter how this makes the left look, do you see people ACTUALLY care about violence? They pretend to care bc they don't like the lefts ideals. We are already painted as an equal threat although the left has not even close the same amount of violent behavior.\n\nIn the end what is most important is how to most effectively get rid of the alt right ideology. \n\nSome people can be reached through discourse but not everyone, if they feel comfortable sharing their ideas the ideas get more mainstream, some people will not listen to reason and need to be reminded that the narrative of the weak left is not true. Fascism needs time to grow and is just constantly testing the limits, if they don't listen to reason violence is at least on the table. The right is fueled by this idea that they are superior in every way to the left and they don't condemn violence.\n\nIf you believe in peaceful protest all the way down, good for you but just like the \"peaceful\" right is not criticizing the \"violent\" right we shouldn't either, it is just derailing the conversation into nothing.",

If you say you want everyone to be able to purchase a gun, then that includes ex-felons getting out of prison for attempted murder on their ex-wives to be able to go to any store and purchase one and try to finish the job.  I don't think that's unreasonable to want to prevent that.  If you prove to not be able to use a gun responsibly or you're too young, guns should be off limits for you.\n\nI think most people who own guns are responsible gun owners, *including* conservatives. That is to say, they might keep a gun on them, but it is unloaded or at least with the safety on and behind a safe under lock and key.\n\nPeople get these wild slippery slope dystopian fantasies where if we check if a person is a felon before giving them a gun, next week we'll be breaking into their houses and forcing everyone to give up their weapons.  That is most definitely not what I want, and I think most on the left wouldn't want that as well.\n\nThat said, owning a gun assumes the owner is responsible.  What happens if Trump on live TV says the right will wage war against the left and to kill your liberal neighbors?  40% have said they are willing to resort to violence if need-be to \"make things right\" for this past election.  The fact that we all have guns is a literal nightmare waiting to happen on the scale of \"The Purge\".  Even if 5% of that 40% willing to resort to violence actually commits acts of violence, the country is on its knees.\n\nAt the very least, we need to ensure the crazies don't get guns..",
