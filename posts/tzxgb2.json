Since the new wave a feminsim all these phonys try to manipulate you and say its also for men while talking 99% allways about problems they are affected by or at least think they are.\n\nIt depends on the topic if you can generalize something a lot. Like it will barely ever be 100% accurate but for example females are more affected by sexual violence. Like thats a fact and its usually not other females doing that. Sure there are some really rare cases of men getting raped by woman but its not the best argument for mensrights cause females have to deal with that A LOT more. Not that it doesnt exist and its really bad but for example: I'm a hetero male and I had female friends slapping my butt as a joke and gay dudes hitting on me but tbh I had to NEVER ever worry about anything. Just some crazy exes who really crossed the borders (insulted me, cheated, stalked me) but I never had to deal with sexual assault.\n\nNone of that is caused mostly by men. Do only men decide to let someone loose the custody battle for example?",
