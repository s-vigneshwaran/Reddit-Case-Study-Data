  "text": "TIFU: realizing that I'm infertile\nThrowaway for obvious reasons.\n\nSo I went to the flea market and found some cool stuff like a Didgeridoo and an old Gameboy advance. But something else struck me. A microscope for only 5 bucks.\n\nIt was in great condition and still had all the little extras since it was made for kids. As soon as I got home, i needed to examine everything. So I grabbed a thin slice of cucumber, and than a leaf. I was astonished how well it worked given that it was for kids. I then used a drop of blood, and you could see the red blood cells in all their glory.\n\nSo I thought what every guy probably would have done. I know it's no nut November, but i was eager to look at my future children while they were still inside my balls. So I pulled up a nice video from my girlfriend and started to masturbate. I managed it to catch all of my cum in a petri dish, and used a pipette to add a bit to the microscope slide. I was so excited. \n\nAs I slowly upped the magnification, i needed to adjust the focus. And there I saw my sperm. But it wasn't moving. Not one bit. I was shocked and didn't knew what to do. So I made an appointment at my urologist to make an infertility test. And now k know it officially that I'm indeed infertile. Sorry mom and dad, as an only child, it seems like out family genes end here.\n\n\nTL;DR used a microscope to look at my semen, only to realize I'm infertile",

The root of the words is Germanic, but Modern English borrowed from French sonde in producing the modern forms, in both loanword and anglicised versions. Today a sonde can be any of various probes for exploring the sea, the atmosphere, the human body, or other animal bodies (for example, a sondes for water quality, radiosondes, rocketsondes, urethral sondes).",

I care about her as a human and I don't know her.

Because that could lead to her having her feet or legs amputated. You can also go blind from untreated Diabetes. \n\nI hope everything works out for you and your family and your stubborn Mama gets the help she needs. I understand how hard it is. My Dad was a stubborn man. He got into the car in a hissy fit because we tried to get him to get to the hospital ASAP because he was acting drunk. He promptly drove to my sister's, which was then like 8 blocks away, and drove through the support column at the front of her house. Luckily nobody was hurt and the landlord was nice and replaced it free of charge. (He's been gone since 2013, died from smoking induced lung cancer/emphysema) \n\nWhen he eventually got to the hospital, they had to get a special meter because his sugar was too high. It was in the low 800 range. I'm surprised he didn't die right then. Sorry for the long post. Take care.",

Not just too much sugar as in obesity, but also could be because of a lack of exercise. When you exercise, you burn energy (ATP?) and insulin tells your cells to use the blood sugar to recharge.  If there's nowhere for this sugar to go - not using up existing cell energy stored - then over time your system becomes immune to the message to process the sugar.  So exercise is as important as less sugar consumption. \n\nAnd... surges of glucose in the blood exacerbate this condition; sugar creates these surges which cannot easily be processed, while starch in normal meals creates a much lower level of glucose, but for longer. \n\nThe doctors doing an experiment about this were only half-joking about the \"90-second workout\".  They had diabetic patients use an exercise bike as fast as they could for 90 seconds, twice a week. Theory was, for the first 60 seconds or so, you burn ATP. After than your muscles switch to aerobic mode. So they were aiming to have patients drain their thigh muscles (biggest muscles in the body) and let the body recharge ATP from glucose, thus over time train the body to process glucose again, and so lessen the problem with diabetes II.  \n\nNot sure how effective this ended up being.\n\nAlso from what I've read, the nerve damage (loss of feeling in limbs, blindness) from high glucose is progressive and irreversible. \n\nAt the very least, get mom up and walking half an hour a day...",

              "text": "Hijacking your comment to mention the use of the \"tussenvoegsel\" in Van Leeuwenhoeks name, especially since a lot of people in this thread use it incorrectly! Hopefully some people will learn something new and interesting from it.\n\n\nSince Antonie van Leeuwenhoek was from the Netherlands he carried a Dutch surname, and while it's not common in English, the \"van\" preposition is important in Dutch. When stating the surname of a Dutch person prepositions are almost always included. The reason why I noticed is because I don't think I've ever heard a Dutch person refer to him as \"Leeuwenhoek\", they would just naturally call him \"*Van* Leeuwenhoek\".\nEven if it's indexed somewhere it will be added after the surname. In a list of surnames you'd find the above name under the \"L\" for \"Leeuwenhoek*, van*\"\n\n\nAnother few examples, you wouldn't talk about \"Gogh\" the painter, you'd talk about \"*Van* Gogh\". You're not listening to \"Armin Buuren\" but \"Armin *van* Buuren\" and the band isn't called \"Halen\", it's \"*Van* Halen\", although Americanized Dutch names are a whole topic of themselves.\n\n\n**Tl;dr: Dutch prepositions might be strange to most, but the correct use is indeed \"Antonie van Leeuwenhoek/Dr. Van Leeuwenhoek\" and not \"Antonie Leeuwenhoek/Dr. Leeuwenhoek\".**\nedit: formatting.",

Shit, you could buy hundreds of them although their upkeep would overtake the costs of making your own baby after a year or two, but these ones are already at a good age, like 6 to 8 years old and already used to work. Get some of them for your entertainment and they're ready off the shelf to start working for your retirement. Adopting locally might be an option too.",

Sterile means it\u2019s (more or less) impossible. \n\nSterility can\u2019t be diagnosed unless you\u2019ve actually been trying to have a child for a long period of time (or if you\u2019ve been medically sterilized).  Infertility can be diagnosed based on shorter term periods of not being able to get pregnant, or based on other stuff like deformations of sexual organs, sperm count/mobility, scarring and other abnormal tissue, miscarriages, etc.\n\nAll infertility means is that you\u2019re going to need more tries and/or better timing to get pregnant or cause pregnancy.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the rub, there\u2019s *no* doctor out there telling infertile people that they can\u2019t have kids! They rarely even use the word \u201cinfertile\u201d without *lots* of context because of the possible confusion! For some reason, people hear \u201cmay have some difficulty conceiving\u201d and thinks that means \u201csterile\u201d. I truly don\u2019t know why so many people have this misunderstanding. Like, if you were *sterile*, totally incapable of having kids, wouldn\u2019t you expect them to say that?! \n\nAnywho\u2026 I know 7 women who thought their doctors telling them their endometriosis or PCOS *might* later affect their ability to get pregnant, *if* left untreated, and they heard \u201cI don\u2019t have to use condoms anymore\u201d. Of course they got treatment (rounds of birth control before going off), then were surprised when they got pregnant and pissed because they\u2019re pro-life and don\u2019t like their baby daddies. I literally tried to correct two of them pre-pregnancy, and they looked at me like I was dumb like \u201cI think I know what my doctor told me\u201d. Apparently not, though.",

If your doctor tells you that you're infertile and your wife/gf gets pregnant those nagging doubts are always going to be in the back of your mind.

And it's not right to leave the guy in that state of not knowing.\n\nI'm not saying it would be right for him to flip out on you and throw out accusations.

The epididymis in OP's case is likely not doing enough to keep the sperm viable, causing it to die quickly. Some may live long enough to make it outside the body, but their chances of reaching an egg are slim given how relatively few sperm make it to the egg in even a fertile situation. \n\nI'm not a doctor though.

Hot baths, car seat warmers, etc are all possibly responsible.\n\nI'm not a doctor, and all of this is anecdotal, but I will say this: for how much our health insurance situation sucks, the medical industry in USA has really done incredible, miraculous things. We developed a robot that can do surgery on a grape. We have cancer treatments where the drugs only target the cancerous cells so you don't get destroyed by chemo while trying to kill the cancer. \n\nMore to this topic, we have ways of extracting a single sperm cell from the tissue of an actual testicle, freezing that single cell, successfully thawing it, implanting it into an egg retrieved from a woman with a whole nother set of miracles, growing and incubating this blastocyst to a stable place, implanting it microscopically into a woman's uterus, and months later deliver a perfectly healthy, adorable, brilliant, glowing, sometimes maddening, little baby boy. \n\nNever tell me the odds.",

                  "text": "I had 12 healthy PGS embroyos. All of our transfers were two grade A+ embroyos each time. My linings were the perfect thickness...\n\nThey just didn't take. \n\nIt was only that LAST single embroyo that finally took. (For the record, we realized all too late that the most important thing was only going forward when my lining was trilaminar - please look into it - it's something many clinics don't bother to care about - they only care about the lining thickness- but waiting for a trilaminar lining was ultimately was gave us success - even though we waited through 7 cancelled cycles to get a lining that was trilaminar in pattern. We also used embryo glue, which my clinic has had a good deal of anecdotal success with - I would recommend it, it only added about $90 to our cost). \n\nAll I'm saying- is that yes - in theory - it only takes one good sperm and one good egg to make a baby. \n\nBut it's a hell of a lot harder than many people think, and the odds are astronomically not in our favor, even when everything seems perfect. \n\nI wish you all the best- I genuinely do. \n\nI just don't want you to think that because you've got 6 good healthy embroyos, you're going to get 6 healthy pregnancies from them. It rarely, if ever, works that way. I just want you to be prepared, to support each other - and to realize that no matter what you do - the odds are about 17- 20% per cycle. It doesnt increase much more than that by transferring more than one at a time. \n\nIm not trying to be a downer. I promise. I just want you to be prepared for what IVF brings with it. Because when we got our first set of healthy embroyos after having 30 great looking eggs collected twice- losing half that didn't fertilize... Then losing half of those that didn't grow to the 5 day point... Then losing half of those to PGS testing... We thought the hard part was behind us because we had 3 healthy boys and 9 healthy girls and we were READY to do this! \n\nIt took 4 years, and we were on our final embryo - and the first test after my 2ww was NEGATIVE. It wasn't until the blood work came back JUST BARELY positive .... And that's the one that turned into a healthy pregnancy and our now 8 month old baby boy. \n\nI hope you get your miracle - I genuinely do.",

They are basically unpaid nannies and housemaids with no employee rights or pay. \nImagine you as are a teenager. I don\u2019t know if you are one or not, but imagine. And as a teenager in your formative years you have to spend all your non-school time on taking care of a younger sibling.  No social life. No time to develop hobbies, find interests. Often no time or energy left to even do decent homework. Forget about going to movies. It is all denied because your sibling/siblings depend on you to take care of them. You can not grow as your own person, instead you are being morphed into a parent of your siblings. And you have no much choice. While your schoolmates get to do teenage things, you are in a cage, and that cage may be the only thing you know. What would that do to a person mentally?\n\nI suppose what you are thinking about is quite the other beast. Yes, it\u2019s nice when your parents teach you things and sometimes actively involve you in THEIR responsibilities. You may learn how to warm a baby formula, how to do laundry or that toddlers throw tantrums sometimes and how to manage them. It may be a good life and family bonding experience, but not when it\u2019s straight up \u201cparentification\u201d thing.",

We're not at the point where we can commercially gene edit away problems.\n\nThen again, the majority of the human population has benefitted from medical advances. Directly related to reproductive systems, mothers sometimes have choose to c-section because natural childbirth is risky business for both child and mother. Should we also apply this to birthing because the baby happened to be strangled by the placenta, has an abnormally large head, and/or exits feet first? \n\nMy thoughts are that everyone benefits from medical advances, and spreading some dysgenic genes doesn't mean everything else is bad, and will increase diversity in the gene pool. One example I can think of right now is people with sickle blood cells typically have anemia, but high resistance to malaria. \n\nHumanity's great thinkers have had hereditary diseases, but thinking isn't always shaped by hereditary traits, but is definitely shaped by one's environment. It seems passing on dysgenic genes doesn't matter in the end when humans are no longer bound by nature, and we can shape the world to make it fit for us to live in.",

Both completely healthy in every way, both scoring as extremely mentally advanced in their checks.

Female hyena reproduction is absolutely horrific and also naturally evolved human reproduction is still dangerous as hell for the mother and child. Wtf. We evolved to walk on 2 legs and we evolved with bigger brains and as a result it completely fucked up over how we give birth because the birth canal is too narrow in comparison to babies' heads. \n\nGuess everyone who wears glasses or contacts should be killed or not allowed to reproduce, right?

A teenage brother and sister came into their care that they just absolutely fell in love with and knew basically immediately they wanted to adopt. They came from a really shitty home situation, they didn't have any other potential adopters, and both mom and dad were permanently out of the picture. On top of that the kids repeatedly stated explicitly (and in court) that they wanted to stay with my friends rather than go back to their aunt that didn't even want them. Literally every single box that makes it \"easy\" to adopt had been checked. It STILL took them about 3.5 years of the kids being in and out of their home and about $35k in lawyer fees and processing fees to adopt those kids. The oldest was an adult by the time everything went through.",

Hi.\n\nbasically, you have a scrotum because sperm needs a lower temperature than body temperature to stay alive and fertile. it's like throwing a frosted chicken on the balcony when it's freezing outside to keep it from going bad. bring it in and it's going to stink real quick.\n\nSame with your sperm: since your scrotum is squeezed between your legs while sitting, and your legs keep your balls cozy and warm, you have a good chance that you#re basically killing your sperm.\n\nSo, you gotta keep your nutsack a bit more chilled than the rest of you. How you#re gonna do that. While you could (not that's actually working, I dunno, I am just an ADHD person, sucking up everything I find interesting, lol), literally ice your ballsack down, I actually recommend a specific pillow. I think it's a donut pillow? Also, you gotta consider quitting smoking, if you do smoke (not because you're hot, I guess the singly ladies will notice that, alright), eath healthy, nutricious food and get yourself moving. Low down your stress level, too.\n\nwear pants that keep your baby factory surround by air, and not pressed back to your body (remember, we wanna chill them DOWN). And for god's sake: quit no-nut november! This is like you're not bringing your trash out for a whole month, and nobody does that!\n\nNutting lowers the risk of prostata and testicle cancer a lot (from what I read like 8 years ago), and it makes space for fresher, newer sperm. Personally, I would try to be as happy and healthy and only smoking because I look pretty damn good, but not actually smoking, like vape or cigarettes, clean out the pipes like at least 3 times a week (but don't go overboard, or you'll shoot blanks....), drink water, avoid warming my balls with my own body heat (yes, it's cozy, but well), and hope that gets at least SOME swimmers going again over time.\n\nbecause IF those little fucker do, then at least they can suck them out of a petri dish to meet an ovarie in another petri dish to make an actual baby.\n\nAnd if not: look, if you really want a child, there is a treatment where they LITERALLY find that one working sperm to make that conception happen. everything else is up to luck.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: some wordy words",

Like if the dish was exceptionally cold, or you damaged it between transfer, or it was over 10 mins between collection and review - it could all have an impact.

In IVF they place the sperm onto the egg, ensuring fertilisation if the sperm is at all capable of that. According to some sources even weirdly shaped sperm can do that, though there's no data on how that might affect the embryo - genetic diseases, syndromes etc. Were the sperm weirdly shaped, essentially? OP hasn't mentioned morphology. Full infertility would be if no sperm were produced, and that's not the case here.",

For example there could have been a trace of some unknown substance in the Petri dish or pipette which acted on your semen to make it immobile.  Even if proper testing confirms that your sperm are not strong swimmers, there are treatment options available.  The treatment depends on what's causing the immobile sperm.  If the worst happens, that you are not able to produce active sperm, you will not be the first nor the last man this has happened to.  And many of those men are proud fathers because of modern fertility treatment.  \n\nSo don't panic, don't let this hit you hard.  Get it looked at and take it from there.  Good luck.",

And a piece of hope is that there are tons of treatments. For motility there are even some OTC, you'd have to look it up but I believe even just vitamin E and C in high doses increases motility a lot.",

Guess what, sperm are microbes. So if you use lotion to wank, or use baby wipes, or have sanitizer on your hands, or even plain astro glide... it can kill some sperm.\n\nThe microscope may also have a lightbulb that fries them dead, it can be a heat source. By the time you focus, you've fried them like a frying pan.\n\nLots of technical stuff could be going on here. So do NOT assume you are sterile. In the lab we count a few hundred, it's normal to see plenty not moving.\n\nSome of them clump up together as a protective strategy to block other (stranger) sperm from getting to the egg. The proportion of your sperm that do that is actually controlled by your perception of partner fidelity. \n\nLastly, the little guys get tired. If you look 2 hours later, they have traveled as far as they can on the tank of gas they are carrying.\n\nThe good news is that immobile sperm is still plenty useful for fertility purposes, so even if all your guys are lazy, good chance you can still have kids some day.",
