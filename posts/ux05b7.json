Because all that comes to mind are all the times feminists advocated against gender-neutral laws, advocated for biased laws against men, protested against measures taken to help men, the time the office of violence against women advocated against spending public money on abuse shelters for men despite the fact that men make up almost half of all domestic violence victims, etc.\n\nYou can recite the dictionary all you want, but actions speak louder than words, and feminists have proven time and again that they are at the core, an anti-male movement.\n\nFeminists have always denied the existence of problems that men face because doing so would undermine the most fundamental premise of their ideology. Any acknowledgement that men face any social inequalities is a threat to feminism itself, which is why they always have to deny the fact that men face and problems which means feminism cannot be described as a movement for equality.\n\nAnd this is exactly why they try to shut down any criticism of the feminist movement through excuses of \u2018feminism being about equality because it says so in the dictionary\u2019. This really isn\u2019t any different to men who try to shut down wrongdoings perpetrated by men by saying \u2018not all men\u2019 or \u2018those are manchildren not men\u2019.\n\nI have a question, do you support animal rights? Do you know who else supported animal rights? Hitler. Looks like you\u2019re a Nazi now. Isn\u2019t logic wonderful?",
