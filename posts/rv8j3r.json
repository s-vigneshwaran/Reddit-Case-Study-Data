That always involves risks.  \n\nYour job isn\u2019t your school, where they coddle you and wipe your ass and seem to feel some duty to make you feel \u201csafe\u201d and look after your feelings.  Men and women risk sexual harassment going to work and being around sexual people.  Men and women take risks getting out of bed in the morning.  And yes, it is reasonable that people have some protection against sexual harassment.  But when we go overboard, and there is no due process?  When a certain percentage of people are nuts, malicious, etc, and you create an environment where the incentives are all aligned with believing whatever said bad actor says?  Then those \u201cwell intentioned\u201d protections become a cudgel, and the risk to reward ratio of bothering with mentorship goes out the window.  \n\nI mentor a younger and coincidentally very attractive junior engineer at work right now.  And I thank god it\u2019s all remote, over Zoom, recorded, and that I control the recordings.  We\u2019ve had sessions for about a year now and would likely keep in touch after one of us leaves the company.  But would I ever meet up with her 1:1 in person with all this woke shit in the workplace?  100% not.  Not even for coffee or lunch or whatever.  Just not worth the risk.  She\u2019s already been trained and indoctrinated to cry \u201csexism\u201d at fairly ordinary stuff that young engineers face (senior engineers not always liking your ideas, people talking over each other in meetings, management not wanting to give you huge raises each year just because you set the world on fire with your two years out of college awesomeness, etc).  Why would I, a middle aged and very successful engineer, take that risk just to do some free labor the company doesn\u2019t really care about anyways?  And if she (or you) don\u2019t like that, \u201ctoo fucking bad\u201d.\n\nWhy is it far lefties are always in denial about the secondary/tertiary consequences of their politics?",

Let me explain more of my fears of the consequences of letting them happen.\n\nMen would be living under the Sword of Damocles. Feminists would be just itching for an excuse to kill the nearest man and when that happens, the man would have no more than two choices. Let himself be killed or defend himself, and I don't mean in court.\n\nAnd what happens if it gets to the point where false rape claims are made on a daily basis? Men will have nothing to lose and what would that lead to? Let's not say the answer to that.\n\nThe consequnces of investigating false rape claims are harsh, yes.

I think false accusations should be taken more seriously as they are very much capable of ruining people\u2019s lives, and I agree that there should be consequences for people who falsely accuse others. However, people often forget how rare the chance of being falsely accused is. You are more likely to be sexually assaulted as a man then falsely accused. The false allegation figure is estimated to be 0.5% (in 2018). In addition, a lot of the people who falsely accuse others have a long history of lying or something similar. The chance of you being falsely accused out of the blue is very very unlikely.",

I linked one, which is a quick and easy read, above. I am also happy to send you more studies if you were like. Statistically men are more likely to be raped then falsely accused of rape. While data may not be perfect considering a lot of rape (and I am guessing false accusations too!) cases go unreported, it is not a minor statistical difference, and so very clearly true, even if the numbers are not absolutely exact. I am glad there is a subreddit for victims of false accusations and I do genuinely believe it is a problem, but (statistically) it is very clearly not a bigger problem then sexual assault, and considering the rarity of being falsely accused, it is not something anyone should be concerned about randomly happening to them (I guess unless they are a celebrity for whom false accusations are often more common). \n\nI\u2019m referring to percentages. Yes, I entirely believe that some people\u2019s lives have been ruined by false accusations, as you said, we can see this by all the reports on that subreddit. But more men\u2019s lives have been ruined by rape then being falsely accused of rape. This is not to say that the number of people who have been falsely accused are negligible, of course they are not, we are on a planet of over 7 billion people. \n\n1 in 6 American women are a victim of rape in their lifetime, and 1 in 33 men. Do you mean to tell me that for every 33 men you know in real life, at least 1 has been falsely accused of rape? \n\nNot only all of that, you are **15 times** more likely to be falsely accused of murder then falsely accused of rape, yet I much more often see people worrying about getting accused of rape (or other sexual assault) then murder.\n\nThat said, if you have any articles from a legitimate source with statistics showing that you are more likely to be falsely accused of rape then be a victim of rape, as you said, feel free to send them to me.",

Fucking WHY!?\n\nToo many of these types have horrible reactions to stuff and show you why the opinion in the first place is held.  \n\nIt's liek that 50 somethign percent of men won't date a feminists, and thousands of feminists  retweeted it with these vial responses.  This is why you clowns!",

You have to earn it through effort, determination, drive, responsibility, respect and professionalism. \n\nEven then, it is at OUR discretion whom we want to mentor, guide, teach or communicate with...on OUR terms.\n\nThe world owes you nothing. Not even a thought. Posts like this only reinforce our hesitancy to teach you.\n\nI'm so glad she posted this. I'm sure her coworkers will now treat her like a leper. This post alone assures me that no one will want to be in a room alone with her....further proving our point. Her career is over. She's radioactive now. No one will even try to get near her.",

And they did something stupid/young to bring back those feelings of invincibility or possibility.  They bought something expensive they really couldn't afford, had sex with someone they shouldn't, travel to exotic places, got a new job/career.\n\nBut these last few generations are full of people whose expectations where set stupidly high by SM, they're incredibly self centered and never really learned about delayed gratification.  So the crash is harder and they are willing to burn the world down to get what they are 'owed'.\n\nAdd to that a womans ability to completely destroy a man with an accusation of sexual harrassment, or rape (the definition of which now includes complimenting how she looks), and they wonder why men with something to lose want nothing to do with them professionally.",
