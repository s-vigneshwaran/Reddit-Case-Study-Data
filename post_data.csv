The basics:

Some atheists are now going to services to monitor political influence used by preachers, priests, etc., and reporting them for violation of their tax-exempt status.

Use form [IRS 13909](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f13909.pdf), and check boxes 3-5 or those that apply.

Also use [form 211](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f211.pdf) to claim whistle blower reward.

https://www.thenewcivilrightsmovement.com/2022/07/scotus-justices-pray-with-evangelical-attorneys-whose-brief-was-cited-to-overturn-roe-says-christian-activist-report/

A veteran Christian activist who works for a legal organization that has appeared on the Southern Poverty Law Center’s list of anti-LGBTQ hate groups was caught on a hot mic bragging that she and the organization she works for prayed with the Justices inside the U.S. Supreme Court, according to a report by Rolling Stone. Conservative justices cited the organization’s brief in the decision that overturned Roe v. Wade.

The activist, “a prominent Capitol Hill religious leader,” Rolling Stone reports, “was caught on a hot mic making a bombshell claim: that she prays with sitting justices inside the high court. ‘We’re the only people who do that,’ Peggy Nienaber said.”

Calling the disclosure “a serious matter on its own terms,” Rolling Stone says it “also suggested a major conflict of interest. Nienaber’s ministry’s umbrella organization, Liberty Counsel, frequently brings lawsuits before the Supreme Court. In fact, the conservative majority in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health, which ended nearly 50 years of federal abortion rights, cited an amicus brief authored by Liberty Counsel in its ruling.”",atheism,942

To me, I find that to be complete hypocrisy from Christians. I also think that it is very controlling and intimidating behavior.

I will be honest that this post is mainly based on my own personal experiences with Christianity.

**Original Post**How has this not come up in every religious debate? I'm just finding out about this out now?

I was under the impression that all the gospels were written by Jesus's disciples. You know the Guys he grabbed from the fishing docks and made them fishers of men.

Witnessed Jesus:

* Perform miracles
* Perform the sermon on the mount
* Eat during the last supper
* Die on the cross
* Come back from the dead and hang out for 40 days

But instead I find out:

* Writers of bible never met Jesus when he was alive.
* It was written ~~60-100~~ **25-80** years after Jesus died.
* No eyewitness accounts in the bible
* First writings recorded 25 years after Jesus was crucified.

How is this not in the opening statement during every theology debate?

**New Info**

I continue to update my understanding but these video's blew me away. Sets up visuals that really illustrate the who what and when regarding the authors of the New Testament. (it's very comprehensive)

It's been pointed out to me that the authors didn't meet Jesus but they could have walked the earth the same time as Jesus alive, I will concede this point.

qq41vv,"My lack of religious beliefs was used against me in family court
Yesterday, my soon-to-be ex-wife and I had our first interim family court custody hearing. My ex had custody of our 15 year old son last year over the winter holiday break. I was asking for the same amount of time this year. When her lawyer cross-examined me, she started by asking me what my religion is. I responded stating I wasn't sure how that was relevant. She switched to asking me if I celebrate Christmas. Obviously I don't, I'm agnostic. The hearing officer admonished me for being agnostic and wanting equal custody time with my son. 

It should be noted that my soon-to-be ex-wife had an affair, which is why we are ending a 16 year marriage. 

Is it legal to use my non-religious beliefs against me in a holiday custody dispute?

**edit** 

* I only requested the custody hearing because my son has told his mom and myself that he wants to spend the break with me, since he spent the last one with her.  She lied about this point in the hearing and stated that our son doesn't want to spend any holidays with me.

* I have a lawyer and she was precent

* It will take another 10-12 months before the courts will hear my son's opinion on this

* I understand my usage of ""obviously"" was poor.  I was under an immense amount of pressure at the time.  I do not celebrate Christmas in any way, shape or form.  This doesn't mean I don't like spending the winter break doing stuff with my kiddo.",atheism,1963

It finally happened. The Keller Independent School District in Texas banned the Bible in school… at least temporarily. And we have conservative Christians to thank for it.

Keller ISD, in Tarrant County, has seen a flurry of activity around book bans recently. Since last October, conservative parents have demanded that certain books be censored and kept away from students because they include content deemed too mature for their eyes. 33 books have been challenged by parents and community members, including a graphic novel adaptation of Anne Frank’s Diary, Toni Morrison’s The Bluest Eye, and “The Bible (All Versions).”

In the case of the Bible, an unnamed parent raised the concern. A reason was not specified.

I'm seeing a lot of arguments being made against an abortion ban as if the forced birth, Bible-thumper crowd give a singular shit about logic:

Abortion access reduces abortion.

*THEY DON'T CARE.*

The Bible only gives instructions on how to perform an abortion.

*THEY DON'T CARE.*

Ectopic pregnancies can't be saved.

*THEY DON'T CARE.*

It's hypocritical to care about the unborn and abandon them as soon as they're born due to lack of funding for financial assistance programs.

*THEY DON'T CARE*

Third trimester abortions are rare and almost always for medical reasons.

*THEY DON'T CARE.*

Jesus never mentioned abortions.

*THEY DON'T CARE.*

You don't even read your own Bible.

*THEY DON'T CARE*

This will kill more women.

*THEY DON'T CARE.*

This will force children into poverty, into families that don't want them.

# They. Don't. FUCKING. CARE.

This is has never been about logic. This has never been about debate. It's about control by whatever means necessary. While well-meaning people voice their arguments against the hell we're seeing unfold, these zealots continue to embolden themselves and position themselves to strike just like they have been for decades leading up to this moment.

I don't have a good solution at this point other than burning shit down in a rage. I feel like playing nice and trying to be civil is what has led us to our current situation.

ut7dvr,"My money worshipping evangelical grandparents ran a puppy mill from their barn and it showed me how much evangelical Christians value money over life.
My dad’s parents were both mega church attending evangelical Christians.  They owned a construction business and we’re decently successful so they always made a big show of their ‘generosity’ by donating some new addition for the church or traveling to some other country to build a school or church (it had to have their name or company name on it or associated with it).  They were always involved in church activities and constantly put down anyone they didn’t think was Christian enough.  Their gossip about others was nasty and mean so I had never viewed them as ‘good’ but I had no idea how bad they really were. 
So, despite being so successful, my grandfather had a secret side business.  His father had bred Dalmatians and he continued that himself.  I was almost 10 before I even knew about it.  There was an old barn on the edge of their property that we never really went near because it was so far from the house.  I never saw any dogs on their property ever and never would have even thought they had dogs.  One day, my dad needed to see his dad about something and he drove down to the barn to speak with him and I happened to be in the truck. We got out and I was stunned when we went in the barn…Dalmatians in little cages stacked high all around the walls and in the middle of the barn.  Worse, there were dead ones (puppies and adult) in a corner.  I just remembered it smelled really bad and the dogs just kinda whimpered constantly.  I was horrified.  
When we got back in the truck I asked my dad about the dogs.  He told me grandpa breeds dogs and sells them.  I told him I have never seen dogs running around.  He said they never leave that barn, they’re born there and then sold.  I said some of the dogs were adults and he told me those were used for making more dogs so they stay but the rest get sold.  He literally seemed to think nothing of this.  I asked about the dead dogs and he said not all dogs are ‘born right’ so they get put down. My grandparents constant need to be seen as super Christian was already off putting to me but finding this ‘secret’ dog business showed me something darker. 

By the time I was a teen I knew a little more of the truth of this barn.  They talked openly about the business at times.  They literally were the worst of the worst type of dog breeder.  This group of dogs were the same line his father had so they’re all very inbred.   He would kill many of them due to the serious health problems that made them unable to be sold.  However, he knowingly bread deaf dogs saying that ‘it’s not guaranteed their puppies will be deaf.’  He bred them constantly to make up for how many had to be put down.  These dogs never saw a vet, never left that barn, rarely even left the dirty cages and lived a life of pure hell.  I only went back in the barn one other time.  My dad had injured his back and told me to help him bring newspaper down to the barn for the cages.  I remember seeing so many caged dogs.  I saw 2 mother dogs scrawny, laying there on urine soaked newspaper, unable to stand, missing teeth and with wounds on their body…and very pregnant.  I also realized he literally killed dogs by hitting them with a bat when I saw a bat with blood and dog bits on it next to a pile of dead dogs.  My grandfather was taking pictures and choked a puppy that whined too much and wouldn’t be still when he took it out of its cage to be photographed for sale. He had no issue with how he treated these dogs and had no problem brutally killing these animals.  My dad and his mom also didn’t seem to have any issues with this ‘business’. My grandfather referred to the dogs as ‘merchandise’, they literally only had monetary value…he didn’t care that they were living creatures (supposedly made by his God).

When I had first seen the barn, I was little (9) and it was brief so I had questioned if maybe I was just not remembering right.  I thought they sold the dogs and they just didn’t think of them as pets so they must have been unintentionally mean.  However, after the second time I saw the barn when I was 14, I knew it was worse than I remembered.  I was so disturbed I told my mom.  By this time my parents were divorced.  My mom said she vaguely knew about the dog breeding but had no idea it was this.  She called the county and humane society and anonymously reported it.  Nothing every happened  with the report….but I refused to ever see my grandparents again and limited my visits with my dad.  I often wonder if the person disregarded the whole report because so many people in town went to that church  and my grandparent were obviously ‘good Christians’.  

My grandparents sent me bibles, religious books, cards, etc…for years trying to get me to ‘return to Jesus’ but I never replied. They stayed active in that church until they died.  My mom did mention that she drove past that church a year or so ago and they had renamed the huge addition my grandparents built after some other local rich religious nut.  Shows you only matter to the church for the money…my grandparents and their church did have the same values after all.",atheism,504

https://onlysky.media/hemant-mehta/fargo-school-board-nixes-pledge-of-allegiance-due-to-under-god-phrase/

In a sensible move that’s sure to infuriate conservatives, the Fargo School Board in North Dakota voted this week to stop saying the Pledge of Allegiance to open their meetings. The board only began saying the Pledge back in April, but the faux-patriotic ritual didn’t go over well with some members of the community who called out the unnecessary injection of God and the lie that we have “liberty and justice for all.”

On Tuesday, board member Seth Holden explained in detail why beginning their meetings with what’s essentially a Christian prayer violates the district’s commitment to inclusion and diversity, urging his colleagues to get rid of the Pledge:

“Given that the word ‘God’ in the text of the Pledge of Allegiance is capitalized,” Holden said. “The text is clearly referring to the Judeo-Christian god and therefore, it does not include any other [faiths] such as Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, all of which are practiced by our staff and students at FPS.“

Even Atheists and Agnostics are excluded from the pledge, Holden added, saying it is a “non-inclusionary act”.",atheism,336

x35iu6,"TIFU / My (20F) girlfriend of two years told me the music that I (25M) play during sex is weird and a major turn off

A little back story; when I first started having sex I researched into ways to be better as I was a little stiff and pretty much had no idea what I was doing. I read online that you can play music and match the rhythm in order to put on a better performance.

I searched love making songs and started slowly creating a playlist in which I was comfortable matching the rhythm.

There are a few songs to my playlist. However there is one song in particular, which actually happens to be my favourite, that my girlfriend hates and says turns her off in a major way. 

I don’t understand why it has taken her two years to tell me she hates that song, it’s a good love making song with good rhythm. I feel the way I fucked up is I could have possibly asked her previously if she likes the playlist or any songs she’d like to add/change. But to leave it for two years thinking our sex life is great but in her eyes has just been ruined by my music has left the whole situation feeling awkward and I’m a bit annoyed. 

I pretty much played this tune every single time so the amount of times she must have not been enjoying it, when I thought the complete opposite is annoying but also embarrassing in ways. 

Not to mention my previous partners, however they never complained about the song so maybe it’s just her?

It’s fucked up the relationship tbh because sex feels awkward now. The other day we were having sex with no music but I was still thrusting to the tune playing in my head. She recognised this and asked me to stop.  

I thought this song was perfect and I always thrust along with the tune and feel it gives me the perfect rhythm for doing the deed to. I usually bust to this song and find it devastating she hates the song. 

[the song itself](https://youtu.be/KAwyWkksXuo)

TL;DR She hates my love making tunes and didn’t tell me for over two years making sex now awkward.",tifu,4703
s3f513,"TIFU by lying to my wife for 13 years…
TIFU by lying to my wife for 13 years…

My wife hates orange and lime flavored candies. I love them. Well, love the orange, like the lime. 

So, she passes on the orange starburst to me. She passes the orange and green skittles to me. She passes the orange and green gummy bears to me. This has been happening for 13 years. 

What she doesn’t know is that the green Haribo gummy bears are actually strawberry. 

Shortly after we married, for one reason or another, I looked at the back of the Haribo gummy bears package and discovered this. 

So I haven’t said anything for 13 years. Every time we get gummy bears, she gives me the orange and green (strawberry). I’ve never said a word. I’ve enjoyed eating my little lies. 

Until last night…

We had some gummy bears and she opened them and she started to hand me the orange and green ones. But after a few minutes, I saw her looking at the back of the bag. Then I saw her eyes get REAL BIG. 

She turned to me and asked if I’ve known that the green bears were strawberry. She always thought they were lime. 

I was honest and nodded my head yes. The look of betrayal was unreal…. She asked how long I’ve known, and I was honest. I told her as long as we’ve been married. 

She quit giving me the gummy bears she didn’t like. She was even eating the orange ones out of spite. 

I don’t think I’ll get any more gummy bear discards after this. Time to buy my own.

Edit: 

We don’t eat these every day. A few times a year at most.

I don’t just get the “rejects.” It’s a shared bag. Whenever she grabs a few, she would pick out the orange and green and hand to me. Just like I would give the pineapple to her (bleh). 


TL;DR I never corrected my wife by telling her she gave me strawberry gummy bears. She thought they were lime. Now she knows and is spite eating my favorites.",tifu,3754
u7wwey,"TIFU by thinking my son was having gay sex when he was just eating Hummus
So I (39F) have a son (15M) and he brought a friend round today.

They immediately went to their room and I assumed they would just play some video games or whatever so I was totally fine leaving them. 

 It was about 30 minutes in when I was walking past, I heard sounds such as 'Omg that's so good' and 'Its so good with that in it' and various 'mmmm' sounds.

It really sounded like they were having gay sex, I was super weirded out by it so I quickly went downstairs and waited for his friend to leave. When this friend left an hour or two later I asked my son what they were doing in his room (because although I don't mind him being gay, and ik it's normal for teenagers to have sex, a condom really should be used) so I planned to confront him about that.

However the answer shocked me to my very core. They weren't having sex, they were _eating hummus_.

I was shocked, and initially didn't believe it. We had never had hummus before and I asked him to show me the hummus if this was true. So he did, and I ate hummus for the first time, and oh my god was it good. We experimented with different things in it like bread and carrots and it was great. Apparently his friend had heard about how he had never had hummus before and thought this was absurd so had planned a date for a hummus party.

So yeah, it ended up being quite a good ending, i discovered how nice hummus was.


TLDR: Thought my son was having gay sex, he just really liked hummus.",tifu,3605
siyvqx,"TIFU by obliterating my wife's fish.
Happened last night.

Wife's 8 year old very large goldfish was passing away.  Had dropsy, was suffering, and was on the verge of death.   Wife and I looked into the symptoms and there was practically no hope of him making a recovery, so she asked me to euthanize him.  Looking into methods, it seemed pretty agreed upon that the most effective and quick way to euthanize a fish was blunt force trauma.

Now, when I was a kid my family were huge anglers, and I was designated as the fish killer when it was time to cook them.  Back then, I was told to slam them on the ground as hard as I could.  Well, my 8 year old body wasnt strong enough to kill them instantaneously so I had to do it multiple times.  Honestly it kind of fucked me up a little.

Flash forward to last night, I didn't want that happening again and I wanted it to be painless.  I asked my wife to leave the room because she was very upset and I chose to do the deed by putting the fish in a plastic grocery bag and slamming it on the counter as hard as I possibly could.

The poor fish was absolutely obliterated.  The force ripped open the bag and sprayed bits of what used to be a goldfish in every direction.  Told my wife to stay upstairs and she started getting suspicious so she comes down after 5 minutes and its just everywhere still.  On the counter, on the stove, on the fridge, on the freaking Christmas tree we still have up, I was still finding pieces of it this morning.  Wife was aghast and traumatized.  Cried until she went to bed.

TL;DR I euthanized my wife's dying fish quickly but in the most visually traumatizing way possible.",tifu,3716
qjzkvz,"TIFU by not kissing a girl at a college football game on national television.
(This happened yesterday)

Also, throwaway since I don't want IRL friends finding my account

So there's a video going around of the Wake vs. Duke football game of a girl leaning in to kiss a guy and him not returning the kiss, and looking away. It's on r/therewasanattempt, and currently on r/popular, as well as trending on TikTok, Instagram, and Twitter.

That guy is me.

I have gotten texts from high school friends I haven't talked to in years, random college classmates, and my sister and mom who have all seen that video, and I'm gonna take this brief moment of internet fame to explain what actually happened.

Basically, I've been talking to this girl for a while and we just started dating about a week ago. I tell her she should come to the Wake game since we are undefeated and will probably win. She says yes. We go with a group of friends, and we are having a great time. Throughout the game we are flirting, hugging, kissing a little bit, etc. We also do this thing where one of us leans in for a kiss, and the other person leans away, which is an inside joke between the two of us. So, we do our little inside joke thing, and unbeknownst to us, we are being recorded.

After the game, I find I'm on the wake forest old row Instagram page, and within the hour I'm on the official old row page. Then, I'm on TikTok, Twitter, and apparently Reddit too.

Just to clarify a few things:

1. She did not get rejected, we were just playing around
2. We did not know we were being recorded
3. If you want proof, check our TikTok accounts (hhhhggggllll and sandx.lop)
4. It was also her first (maybe last?) college football game

Anyway, the internet is full of horrible people and I haven't done any work this weekend, so I'm gonna go do that now. Peace

TL;DR I didn't kiss a girl at a football game and now I'm paying the price.

This happened two days ago (Sunday). A friend of mine is currently on his second mission to the ISS. I saw a call come in on my iPhone and the caller ID said “Us Gov.” I first had that thought / feeling you get when the principal calls you to their office. “Crap. What did I do that I thought I got away with but maybe I didn’t?!” I was in the middle of something with a bunch of people and showed them what it said on my phone and everyone was all ""Don't answer it!"" Between everyone's suggestion and my gut feeling of being in trouble, I sent it to voicemail. Turns out it was my buddy calling from SPACE. I had a chance to speak to someone that wasn't on Earth and screwed it up. First thing he said in the voicemail was “You probably saw a call from Us Gov and turned it down.” I know he’ll call again, but damn I feel like an idiot right now.

TL;DR My buddy called me from the Iinternational Space Station and the caller ID said “Us Gov” so I sent it to voicemail and missed a call from space.

Edit: He called back tonight! What a fascinating and amazing call! I asked where he was flying over and he said the Western coast of Africa. I asked how the ride was and he said smooth and awesome. He said the second stage acceleration was incredible and that they hit over 4Gs, then at SECO they got thrown into their straps from the deceleration, and bam…orbit. Took roughly 8.5 min to get into orbit. They have a couple of days off (not because of Memorial Day). The conversation was 12 minutes long but we had to end it because of a satellite issue that was about to happens (exact reason is out of my wheelhouse). Ironically, I made him and I laser engraved rocks glasses and I was drinking out of it when he called. We also joked about some funny stuff that happened when I went out for the launch. He was cracking up about the situation with the first call that I shared here and said that’s a common occurrence :)",tifu,1478
qet3cp,"TIFU by kissing my deaf Friend
Hi there. (22M)

I'll try to keep it short.

I met a girl through a mutual friend. We've known eachother for roughly a year, but haven't spend time alone yet, always in a group. She's very sweet and pretty.

She's not completly deaf , she can still hear a bit, with the help of hearing aids.

I guess  mild deafness, not sure tho?.

Yesterday we met up with our mutual friends, we were having a barbecue. Later on, we ran out of snacks, so the other two went to the grocery store

&#x200B;

We were alone in the yard, chatting etc.

Now I noticed that she kept staring at my lips, so I thought to myself does she want to kiss me?.

Since she didn't stop staring I thought, that it's obvious. This time I'm not going to miss a hint.

I leaned in to give her a kiss, I mean she did kinda kiss me back, but afterwards it was like dead silence.  Thank God the other two arrived a few minutes later.

The rest of the evening was super akward between us. Later as she left, I told the other two friends that I had kissed her because she kept staring at my lips.

They started laughing saying Of course she's staring at your lips , she's lipreading.!

Man, I totally forgot that deaf people also use lipreading to communicate, and since she's never actually done that before I didn't take that into consideration

This will definitly be one of the moments that'll make me stay up at night and cringe, plus I probably ruined the friendship.

TL;DR by thinking my friend wanted to kiss me, she probably didn't.


UPDATE:  Okay, Guys I sent her a message, asking if she wants to come over.

She said she'll be here in an hour.

I'm nervous lol, I'm trying to convince my roomate to go on a long walk.


Update 2:

Sorry that you guys had to wait that long. 
She just left 5 minutes ago.

I didn't tell her beforehand, that I wanted to talk to her about the kiss, so it was a bit akward approaching the topic.
 I can't go into full detail now, but I told her that I didn't mean to make her feel uncomftable and that I had misread the signs. 
We had a good laugh. 
Afterwards I asked her If she'd be down to maybe try things out if she's interested.

The thing is, she's going to move to Munich, Germany in a few months (end of march) (I live in France) and she told me that, while she does like me, she didn't plan on making any romantic interest, because she doesn't want to get too attached, due to her moving away anyways. 

 She admitted to liking me alot and would like to give it a shot despite the circumstances ,  but only under the condition that I am being serious about it, since she doesn't want something that's only casual.

We're going on a date on Tuesday, and we'll just see if it works out between us.",tifu,1818
x5nhi9,"TIFU - Posting on Reddit about our sex life with CBAT and now our relationship has ended
Ok this exploded more than I expected, and has been a bit overwhelming with the messages but thought I’d give an update. 

The attention hasn’t been exactly positive and this hasn’t been the best thing to happen for my relationship and it’s now sadly ended. 

I didn’t expect it to blow up so much, I should of used an anonymous name instead of my real name and our real ages. 

There aren’t many 25 year old Tyler Life’s who are in a relationship with their s/o for 2 years who is 20.

Unfortunately her younger sister recognised this and showed her parents who wasn’t happy at all and made the situation extremely awkward. 

What made it more awkward, and cemented the fact that it was me, is that they recognised the song. Once at a family dinner we were discussing music tastes and my ex girlfriend stated that I have an odd taste in music. Everyone laughed and pressed me to play something from my phone of what I like as music, to which I then blessed their ears with CBAT.

Her father laughed and said it was terrible, I guess we all have different tastes. Although I nodded in agreement at the time, I was thinking in my head that this is a great fucking song. 

We are over now and I am moving on. I already revealed my face on tiktok, but with the amount of hate I originally got I decided to say I didn’t have it and backtracked.

I don’t think the song is that bad and I had no idea she didn’t like it until recently and as soon as I did I stopped. I didn’t force her CBAT, not all can handle CBAT, I know it’s different. 

I know a lot have asked for face reveal and playlist. My playlist I actually burned onto a CD and have been using my CD player. But I’ll go on YouTube and try link all the songs in one playlist and share.

uughdb,"TIFU by disappointing a man who wanted to get laid by a maid
I'm a professional housecleaner in a large city. My first house today was beautiful and pretty big (4,000+ sq ft.) I had never cleaned this house before today. 

It's kind of interesting to clean the home of people you have never actually met while they are not home. I never snoop but I do learn about people just by the state of their house or whatever is out. These people seemed like they really needed us. I would guess they are busy and don't have much time for cleaning and organizing (but definitely have an active sex life judging by the master bedroom).

I love cleaning dirty houses and was like amping myself up doing a mini Rocky training montage warmup and finding the perfect music to work to (Pantera). I was sweating like 4 hours in but I was getting this house spar👏ka👏ling! All I had left to clean were the floors when a man walked in. 

I welcomed him home and let him know I just needed to clean the floors and would be finished soon. He looked super confused and then kind of grinned and asked if I was his birthday gift.  I didn't really know what he meant. Maybe his wife scheduled the service on his birthday? I just answered with, ""maybe? Happy birthday, Mr. Henricks!"" To which he looked even more confused and told me his name was not Henricks. 

Well. That's because his next door neighbor, my actual client, is Mr. Henricks. I walked my happy ass into the wrong fucking house and cleaned the hell out of it. And then the guy who lived there came home and thought I was a sex worker role playing as a housecleaner hired by his wife as a birthday present. 

I was so totally embarrassed explaining myself to this guy and my boss.  (The entry instructions in the app said the client wouldn't be home but that there was a key under the mat. There was no key under the mat but the front door was unlocked 🤦‍♀️). This is not even the first time in my life that I have let myself into the wrong house, although the first time was not a work thing.

On the plus side, dude was so happy with how clean his house was that I finished the floors and he paid me what my company would have charged him plus a tip!

So my wife is pregnant with our first child and we are about 3 weeks away from the due date. Been a while since we've gotten tangled up in the sheets, so we decided to give it a go. Things go great, but 30 minutes later my wife thinks she peed herself, so she gets up, goes over to the toilet, and proceeds to leak clear fluid from her vagina. She calls me over to check where the fluid is coming from as she thinks she broke her water (same thing happened about 2 weeks ago, but just a small amount of fluid compared to this). We shrug it off, lay back in bed, and then it happens again. We think to ourselves ""oh shit, this may be real"". Then she starts getting a contraction, not one she normally gets, no, this one is stronger and lasts a lot longer than usual.

4 hours later I sit here in the hospital next to her bed, she's 8 cm dilated, epidural given, and now we're waiting for our 1st child to arrive!

So this happened (obligatory ) last night and we are just getting over the laughter. 

My wife and I are early 60s and because of old age, menopause etc etc our sex life has needed medical intervention and a new treatment was suggested to alleviate my wife’s pain during intercourse. 

So ten days ago, jokingly (after a few bottles of wine) we set set an Alexa reminder to announce when the treatment had run it course and we could “officially “ get to it.  We set a reminder. “David it’s time to bonk Fiona”. It seemed bonk didn’t trigger Alexa’s censorship. 

So fast forward ten days.  We had totally forgot this and last night in the middle of a dinner party with several friends we get the reminder. “David reminder. It’s time to bonk Fiona” as you can imagine confusion reined and after a pause in the dinner party conversation questions were asked and our friends joined in on the good humour as we are all similar ages. Pro tip. Everyone gets old, things dint work as well as they once did, but please try and keep your sense of humour.

Edit 1: Thanks everyone some of these comments are hilarious. I played Scotty doesn’t know to Fiona (which I had never heard before) and it’s now her favourite song. Unfortunately none of our friends names are Scotty.

I bought a whiteboard when I moved into my new and current house. This was supposed to be the ultimate pièce de résistance to my awesome new home office. It took a few months to ship, and when it finally did, I was pretty unhappy with it. First of all, there was this big crack behind it, bending the metal in an unsatisfying way, but it wasn't that noticeable so I didn't bother sending it back. The worst, though, was that it was near impossible to write on it without leaving ghost marks. And you can forget about letting some writing on it more than 24 hours.

As a result, I wound up not using it for most of the last year. Basically, his only purpose was as a magnet holder, when it should have been used for so many different projets. 

Today, as I finally had some free time, I looked into the process of cleaning my whiteboard, and making it more usable. As I applied some store bought cleaner, I found this small tear in some kind of plastic coating. I freaked out, ripped it all out and came to the horrifying conclusion that I spent 1 1/2 years writing on plastic.

I had my first gf when i was 19, everything was great, she's a beautiful blonde with blue eyes and had a great personality.

After a few months of dating she told me that she will come visit me at work (a secluded place where no one can see or hear us) we both knew the we're going to have sex for the first time that evening.

So i went out and bought a fresh pack of condoms.
When she came things heated up and we took of our cloths, but suddenly i stared smelling a horrible smell that turned me off completely, i didn't went to disappoint so we had sex anyway but i definitely did not enjoy it.

In the following days i thought that i will never enjoy having sex with her again, and so i broke up with her (i was young and stupid i know)

Three years later, last week, i had used the same brand of condoms and stared smelling EXACTLY the same smell, and realized that the beautiful girl i used to date wasn't stinky - the condoms were.

I feel like I've made the stupidest mistake of my life.

2. The brand off condoms we used is durax (a few people messaged me with the exact same problem. So i guess there are people who are more sensitive to the smell of durax products)

After like an hour she suggested to pay our drinks and go somewhere else for launch and I happily agreed. As we were about to pay our drinks she started searching her purse for her wallet and put various objects on the counter because she seemed like to have a bit of a mess in her purse. One of these objects was a pepper spray. I casually mentioned after leaving the coffee ""Id consider getting a different pepper spray if you plan to defend yourself. This one is quite useless.""

*For a bit of context: I used to test various of pepper sprays and tear gas in the military. We were stupid and young but it was also kind of thrilling. And the product she had was by far the worst/weakest we tested. I just recognized the bottle because it was so bad and thought I should let her know that this is probably not the best option to go with. But she obviously didnt know about that because, well, we just met an hour ago.*

After this comment our conversation kind of died and she suddenly had a work emergency and had to go. I took me a few minutes until I realized that my comment was beyond creepy without any context. I am definitely not used to meet new people. I hope Ive not traumatized her.

Throwaway account because some of my friends/family know my real one

The lottery winning took place back in August 2014. Mike and I were married in October 2014. It wasn't a fortune, but enough to make a difference. After taxes it came out to right around $480,000. Most people would be over the moon, but I panicked. I didn't want our life to turn upside down because we had extra money now.

I was still legally single at the time, and so I was able to accept it anonymously without the need to tell anyone else. So I didn't. Tell anyone else. Not a single soul. Not my husband, my parents, siblings, best friends, etc. Only the state and federal governments.

(My husband has a tendency to spend on things we don't need and that aren't going to benefit us in the long run so I didn't want our money to blown quickly on stupid stuff like cars and clothes.)

I opened a new bank account with a national credit union and put the check in. Got started with a financial advisor (Keith), who guided me into investing in local businesses and real estate. And that's that. It's been sitting there since, just growing.

Flash forward to today. I'm doing dishes getting ready to start making dinner, and my phone rings. I can't get to it but figure I'll call them back. Then I get a text. No big deal. I'll get to it in a minute....but husband came into the kitchen and glanced at my phone to let me know who text me and called me (which he always does if my hands are full).

It's Keith. He called and text me to let me know my account just hit $1 million after one of the energy companies I invested in soared recently.

My husband is stunned. Has no clue what to even say, staring at me until he says ""we have a million dollars??"" I was so flushed but finally just sat him down and explained the situation. He's clearly mad at me for never telling him. Asks if my family knows, and I tell him that no one knows except the IRS and Keith.

It took him a few hours to finally be able to really talk to me.. at the end of the silence he told me he's proud of me for investing into our future but he needs a few days to clear his head because he feels like I hid a huge part of ""myself"" from him.

We might just need to take a vacation now.

TL;DR I won a lottery in 2014 and never told my husband until he learned that I grew the money to a million today.

Edit: I already have people messaging me asking if they can have money. Jesus. This is why I didn't tell anyone!!

Update! My husband and I just spoke on the phone for about an hour. He told me he's staying with his best friend/coworker tonight but that he's not angry. He agreed he would have spent the money on dumb things if he'd won it and is happy that I put it away. Little less happy that I didn't tell him about it for so long, but he said he doesn't care and doesn't want this getting in the way of our marriage.

Update!!!: Hello! Jesus I didn't know this would blow up so much. I've been at work and talking to my husband Mike all day, basically laying down some ground rules for the money moving forward. He will not tell anyone (didn't tell his friend!) and we will only dip in for emergencies and pre-discussed things. A few people asked in the comments how much we make a year, I guess to see where we'd be without this money. I currently make around 60k and Mike makes more at around 85k. So to all the ones saying I ""starved him"" or ""made him scrounge"" that is not true lol. We make a good amount.

qulzyd,"TIFU by showing my girlfriend my actual strength
Standard – this did not happen today. Actually a few years back.

So, when my then gf and I started dating, I discovered early on that she can be quite physical. In the sense that she likes to push, hold, punch even. Bare in mind she is not actually trying to hurt me, she is just playful like that. I found this both adorable and fun, so I played along.

And here is the fuck up… If she pushed me, I would act like I had to balance myself, or if the bed/sofa was nearby I would fall onto it. If she held me, I would pretend that it was difficult for me to get out of her grip. If I pushed her and she resisted, I would pretend it was hard work, same with me holding her arms etc. You get the idea.

I always assumed she knew I was playing along and not actually physically straining myself to compete with her strength. This went on for months.

One day, we were chilling on the sofa, watching a show when I realised, I was running late to meet some friends. I told her I need to shower and make a move, she decided this was a good time for a playfight. She sat on top of me to pin my arms under her knees. I played along and “struggled” to move her off me. A little more ‘wrestling’ took place, with me playing along like I do. Then I told her I really need to make a move. She was not done and continued to hold/push me back onto the sofa. Eventually I decided I need to ‘win’ this little fight and get going. So, I got her onto her back, held her hands near her head and leant down to kiss her on the cheeks a few times and let her know again that I am running late.

She tried to move her arms and could not. Whilst struggling she grunted out. ‘Why are you so strong today.’

I laughed (fuck up No2) and looked at her like she was joking.

Her eyes went wide with comprehension and she stopped struggling. ‘You are always this strong?’ She asked, almost to herself.

‘Come on babe, you did not really think we are of equal strength, did you?’ I replied.

I then went to take a shower, got ready and as I was heading out the door, I noticed that she might have been a little glum. Me, being fully aware that I do not fully comprehend the mystery of female emotions, had no clue why she was upset. I did what all men do, I guessed. I gave her a kiss and said I won’t be gone for long and that I can pick up her favourite Chinese on the way back. I assumed she was upset about me not spending the afternoon with her.

No reply. Fuck up No3 – I should have spent some time talking it through. I instead went on my merry way and had a great fucking time with my friends. She spent the next few hours brewing, simmering, seething, and of course overthinking.

I came home with the Chinese and as soon as I put it down on the dining table, she sprung out of the corner and attacked me. It genuinely surprised me and I reacted by bear hugging her to my chest. She struggled with more force than she normally would and I just held her, I kept asking what was wrong. She gritted her teeth and said. ‘You lied to me.’ Eventually she stopped trying to fight me and I let her go. She then told me how she feels like I lied to her about our ‘fights’ and that really all the time I was laughing at her in my head as I pretended that she was actually winning.

I tried to take the conversation seriously, but come on, how the fuck am I supposed to take this seriously. So I may have been somewhat mocking, flirting, and generally being an arse about the whole thing.

A week later she broke up with me. FML

TL;DR I pretended my girlfriend and I we were of equal strength.

Firstly, there's a lot of she's so ""stupid"", ""crazy"" ""insane"" etc...it's a bit mean. Yeah, she reacted errmm drastically but overall she is a good person.

At a bar nearby, I see the guest - she is very clearly drunk and proceeds to throw up all over the bar. Now this part of town is kinda known for sleazy guys and she’s by herself - so I take her back to the hotel and get her in her room safe before anyone can take advantage of her. I leave her my number to text me when she’s awake to make sure she’s okay and she thanks me the next morning and explains she was blackout drunk and barely remembers any of the night. I thought that was the end of it - until my boss pulled me into a room and proceeded to fire me for “fraternizing with a guest”. I explained that I only got her to her room safe and was worried because she was young and alone, but nope. I’m officially unemployed now. For helping a drunk girl get back to her hotel okay.

TL;DR - got fired for helping a drunk girl get back to her hotel room okay.

Edit: for those asking for more information: I did take her in the closest entrance which was the employee entrance. I think this has a lot more to do with it. My boss is not a rapist and didn’t slip her anything. And while I’m thinking of naming them, I don’t want to get at risk of going up against a large company. I’m a broke 22 year old (and I am a girl, for all y’all who thought I was a man) who was living paycheck to paycheck. I can’t afford a lawyer. I did file for unemployment. I appreciate everyone’s well wishes. 

TW: I actually had a very bad episode as a result of this and attempted. I’m in the hospital now and will not have any way to update further for a while.

Edit 2: thank you everyone, sincerely, for all the well wishes. I’m back from the hospital and am staying with family until I’m a little more stable. I appreciate everyone’s kind words and support. I’m unsure if anyone will see this since it’s been some time, but I thought I’d update.

After much consideration, I’ve decided to name the hotel: Viceroy Chicago. Whether or not you decide to stay there is entirely up to you. There are some wonderful people working there, but it seems they place liability above the mental or physical safety of their guests and employees. This is a passage from the email HR sent me:

“In regards to your employment status with Viceroy Chicago, entering a hotel room with a guest, is in violation of Viceroy policy.  Colleagues are not allowed to stay at the property in which they work and Unauthorized entrance/access to any Viceroy space/facility, offices, guest rooms or computer information sources is conduct that Viceroy considers inappropriate and leads to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, which due to the severity of this infraction, we will terminate employment at this point.“

So there you go. Do with this information whatever you wish. I understand their decision from a liability standpoint personally, but not from a moral or ethical standpoint. While I’m the hospital I realized it was best I got out of there now anyway. I wish you all the best.",tifu,2105
q5pkjm,"TIFU by introducing my widower dad to my husband's single mom.
(Obligatory ""didn't happen today."")

My husband and I have been married for 5 and a half years now. My husband was raised by a single mom, and my mom passed when I was 16, so each of us only had one parent at the wedding.

Our parents met during the wedding planning, and quickly discovered how much they had in common and how well they got along. After a few too many glasses of wine, they danced together at the wedding reception.

We noticed a little bit of flirtation between them, but didn't think much of it until they started seeing each other regularly after the wedding, going out together for drinks, going on walks together, going fishing together. Even though it was a little weird for us that our parents were ambiguously and later officially dating each other, we truly didn't care because they just seemed so happy.

Yesterday, my husband walked his mom down the aisle to meet my dad at the altar. My husband's mom and my dad said their vows, and became husband and wife. And my husband and I became... stepsiblings.

Tldr: my husband's mom and my dad started a romance at our wedding, and yesterday they got married, which makes my husband and I technically stepsiblings.",tifu,2079
utamby,"TIFU by joining my work groupchat and now I feel like throwing up.
I (25F), work with older people (40 - 50+M/F) and today they added me to the whatsapp work group chat. One of my co-workers came to my desk and asked me if I was aware of what my picture was on whatsapp. I use whatsapp very rarely, mostly with friends if we are not using other apps available i.e. Snapchat. I had to check as I had not been on whatsapp in a while. So I open whatsapp to check my picture and felt like throwing up.

So the story behind my whatsapp profile picture is that I saw it on Twitter, showed it to my friends because I thought it was hilarious. One of them said I wouldn't set it at my profile picture, and I said bet. So I set it on an app I never use and completely forgot about it. The picture is a very detailed and pornographic image of Iron Man and Captain America having sex. Picture Attached: [WhatsApp Picture (NSFW)](https://imgur.com/a/MzTNCpr)

Once I saw it, I immediately changed it to the most professional picture of me I could find. As I'm panicking and not knowing what to do, wanting to change my identity - a co-worker comes up to me who usually chats with me and is very friendly with me could not even look me in the eyes. My boss saw this picture, all my co-workers saw this picture, I feel like I have scarred these older people for life.

Tomorrow I have to go back to work and I don't know what to expect or what to do.

TL;DR

My co-workers saw a pornographic image which was set as my profile picture on whatsapp.

tnr2ya,"TIFU by showing my college friends a picture of my mom
It over is a pretty normal day at university and a conversation came up about our parents. A friend of mine, “Jenny” shows us a picture of her father so I pull up Facebook images of my mother and father. A friend of mine saw my father and said I looked just like him but when he saw my mother the color in his face drained.

“Chad” watched me scroll down my picture of my mon then asked about my siblings. He described them in detail, PERFECT DETAIL!!! He then said to me, “Lilly, I think I fucked your mom.” I laughed of course, Chad has a reputation and I figured it was a joke until he described my siblings, my mothers home, the neighborhood and ect. 

I felt horror. Sheer horror. He looked at me, and I looked at him, and he looked at me, and I looked at him, and he looked at me, and I looked at him! Just a few days ago he was flirting with me and what not! And now I find out, he’s a motherfucker! Literally a motherfucker!


TLDR; college friend fucked by mom, described her and my family in detail, and had been trying to put the moves on my days prior without realizing I was her daughter. MOTHERFUCKER!


Edit: To clarify some more things, apparently he found her through a hook up ad. She had someone watching my siblings while she took him to the bone zone… so the bed I’ve sat on has mom and Chad juices on them. He asked me to call him daddy now. I feel homicidal.

Edit 2: my parents haven’t been together for as long as I’ve been alive. My Mom has not had a long lasting relationship through out my life and I kind of blame myself for that. I say this because I was never an easy kid. I was bitter and sad and no one wants a woman with a child that doesn’t receive the necessary mental help to thrive. My mom and I also don’t have the best relationship either. I always felt she was a bit envious of me do to the fact that I’ve been able to maintain a relationship longer than she has at my young age. While I’m a bit frazzled at the prospect of my friend doing my mom I guess I can’t be mad at him because he genuinely didn’t know. A little ways down the road we’ll both laugh at this. My Giga Chad sigma male friend will not end up sleeping with me tho because I am deeply into someone else. My partner said I should fuck his mom tho to assert my dominance.",tifu,1949
tinkwk,"Tifu by eating candy in such a childish fashion that it caused my husband a panic attack and a 911 call
This is so stupid and it happened last night and I'm SURE we'll both laugh about eventually but husband is still kinda ticked... So I was being a trash goblin last night and staying up into the wee hours to eat easter candy and play video games, which I don't do that often.  Anyway, does anyone else enjoy robins eggs? Those neon colored malted milk ball eggs they sell this time of year? Well, as a kid I used to do this stupid thing where I would lick them and smear the color all over my lips because hey, free lipstick! Do not ask what compelled me to do this, but i did this last night with a blue one. Then of course because I am a trash goblin i forgot all about it, fell asleep slack jawed upright on the couch with the lights on and TV still going. Next thing I know theres shouting, panicking sounds, and I'm being shaken violently, and by the time I come to I see my husband fumbling with his phone? I kind of... flapped my arms angrilly and said something like ""whazwrongwitchyou?!"" Yeah, he had been about to call 911 because he just walked out on his wife passed out with blue lips, he thought I was choking. He was pretty incensed when I told him it was candy, it's the dumbest thing I've ever had to explain in our whole marriage.

TL;DR: I accidentally did a candy coated immitation of the recently deceased causing my husband a panic attack and a near summoning of an ambulence.

EDIT- Didn't expect this to be so popular, thanks for the awards, and the discussions on different candy eating rituals! My husband has steadied his nerves and is now just ribbing me mercilessly- not just for scaring him senseless, but also because I've been training for a triathalon and eating really healthily, so this lapse was extra grotesque.",tifu,813

My kid is Minecraft mad and has been since she was 5 years old. She's a great builder and comes up with really interesting creations. But she's stuck on consoles and her iPad and has been making noises about wanting mods for the past 18 months. I keep telling her bedrock doesn't do mods and she always replies with ""well buy me a computer"".  

Well two weeks ago we were talking about her gym class she goes to where they do fun physical fitness stuff for kids. Its at a real gym with real gym instructors. She said they did a plank for 30 seconds as part of her class. And I (stupidly) said if you can beat my plank time id buy her a computer. Now my time is 2.25. And my wifes is around 3.15. 

So the gym instructor asked all the kids what their goals are this year. Just a general life thing not related specifically to physical fitness. Some said stuff like ""read more"" or ""finish X game"" etc. my kid says ""To do a 4 minute plank"".  Well the instructor suddenly had something he could work with. So he said ""ok lets do that!"". 

In my kids bravado she had forgotten the original bet was 2.26 or better. In doing so she overshot it by a fair way and made it considerably harder for herself

By the end she was a sweaty crying mess, her form had gone to hell but it was definitely still a plank. The instructor yelled 4 minutes and she said ""can i stop now?"" between tears and heavy breathing. She stopped at 4.08. 

Anyway, whats a good mid level graphics card for Minecraft with some shaders?

TL;DR Made a stupid bet with my kid about buying her a PC if she beat my plank time. I lost and am now poor.

EDIT: Thanks for all the replies, generous offers of parts and build specs! Wow this blew up while I was asleep on Australia time. She woke up this morning and I said ""Are you sore from yesterday?"" and she says ""No why?"". Well, now im really annoyed. Promise i'll post an update.",tifu,1981
u9ntst,"TIFU telling my parents about my inheritance
TLDR; sister died and left me her home, parents tried to sell it so I had to explain the will. Now they’re gonna sue me. 

[edited to fix spelling / grammar / weird ass sentences I used]

My 36F sister died 6 months ago from a heart condition. She practically raised me so it’s been difficult to deal with. I’m in my final year of University and have failed every single class this semester. She’d be disappointed but it is what it is. My sister never married, never had children. I lived with her near campus. She ran her successful side business, I got to help her occasionally as a paid intern. She worked a lot but not to support us, she wanted to retire by the time she was 40. She would’ve been done in 4 years and her heart had to fail her first. 

When she died, her attorney read her will to me. She had left everything to me. She had a generous amount of money put away for her retirement and side accounts for various activities for her retirement. I did not know that she had made several real estate investments so she could continue living a comfy lifestyle once she retired.  She left her 2006 Subaru to me and willed our current house to me as well. She left nothing to my parents but as they didn’t know she had assets, they willingly paid for the funeral and any other associated costs. My sister was no contact with our parents and I’m very low contact. We are their only two children. 

At the funeral my parents asked me how I was going to continue going to college without her money (lol, they thought she paid for them. Sike I have student debt.) I told them I’d continue to take out loans. They asked about my living arrangements and I shrugged, at the time I didn’t know all the details anyway. Well 2 weeks ago, I found out my parents tried to sell my sisters house whilst I still lived there. They brought a realtor and toured our home and everything. it was all on the cameras set up in the home. When I called them and informed them I’d be calling the police, they explained the situation. I told them it’s my home and it was willed to me. They couldn’t sell it. They were confused heavily. I told them to meet at my attorneys and set a time. 

Cue today. My attorney explained the will to my parents. My mother went white as a sheet and my father was grumbling about suing me for his rightful money plus the cost of the funeral. My mother began ugly sobbing telling the attorney he was wrong, her daughter would not leave the house to someone like me. The attorney cut the meeting short and now we’re preparing for the inevitable lawsuit coming my way. I just want to sleep and avoid all of this. 

just some added info: mom is a stay at home mum but like the kind who spends her life at the country club, not the involved kind. Dad is a business man and is typically on business trips for weeks at a time. They live, as they call it, lower upper class.

edit: I didn’t expect this to blow up tbh, thank you everyone for the support. I’ve gotten to read almost all the comments and I feel a lot less anxious now. I did talk to my professors and 4/6 of them gave me extensions but the other two are being jerks about it. It’s fine tho. I did sign up for my schools grief group. I just got done changing all my locks too. Thanks to everyone who helped me with home stuff too, I’ll be sure to watch the home insurance bill or get a financial advisor or something. My sisters degrees and mine are in the same field so I’ll be continuing her business too and I’ll need a real estate attorney to redo the leases on her other rentals I guess. I don’t know it’s overwhelming.

edit2: since this keeps coming up, I stupidly gave them a key a few months after she passed. I didn’t know they’d even be trying this until after the fact. The will doesn’t say anything about them but I’m leaving it up to the attorney to figure everything out. I will be paying them regardless for the cost of funeral, celebration of life, etc.

Final Update for now: father sent me a text apologising, said he wanted to sell the house because of the market right now but won’t push me. will give more details at some point, gonna see how this plays out first and I’ll give an official update at some point.",tifu,3110
u8qpe7,"TIFU by thinking my son was eating hummus when he was actually having gay sex [UPDATE]
So yeah, the majority of you were right, they were having sex (I did think it sounded like it). They ate some hummus first, then put it away (didn't do anything at the same time like some of you freaks suggested) and then had sex. My son's boyfriend (I think they're boyfriends) saw the post and couldn't stop laughing, so told my son (thinking it could be about them) who told me because I think he felt a bit guilty about hiding it.

Other than that, nothing really exciting happened. We had a long awkward talk, I told him I don't really endorse him having sex but he should really use a condom etc.

Now onto the more important thing, hummus. I really like hummus now, I'd never had it before because it just looked kinda disgusting (yellow and sludgy) but I have learnt appearances can be deceiving. It was homemade so I'm going to have to ask for the recipe so I can make some more (I've finished all of it)
Also what are some other good things to dip in it? I've tried the obvious things (carrot, cucumber, breads) and any suggestions would be appreciated. 
A lot of people have recommended Baba Ganoush as well? Is that similar or better than Hummus?

She goes to bed, I stay up gaming for a while.

The next morning, a guy in our fantasy football chat posts an image of his Squirtle evolving. Somewhere in the back of my head, I seemed to remember a Riley Reid/Squirtle ""Fuck I'm gonna evolve"" meme, so searched for it. Google thinks I meant Riley Reid Squirt"" of course, so I'm instead greeted by pics of Riley violently blasting cum everywhere, so move on with my morning.

My wife walks into my computer room and says ""I think my phones been hacked, there's someone searching stuff that isn't me"". She shows me her phone, and all the previous search history pops up:

Riley Reid Squirtle Riley Reid Squirt find Darklurker farm giant souls

As a 36 year old man, worse than being caught with porn is having to prove to your wife that you were actually searching Pokémon memes, believe me.

Obligatory 'this happened yesterday'.

The day before yesterday, my foster daughter had a bunch of her friends over to watch the premier of the new BTS video. I'd check on them every now and then and every time I saw them, they were doing these weird stretches with their arms over their heads or behind their backs. After a while, I asked, 'what are you guys doing?' They said it was a flexibility test they learned from friends at school.

Move 1: [Clasp your hands behind your back](https://imgur.com/a/lSDPR7B) with one hand going over your shoulder and one going under.

Move 2: [Prayer hands behind your back](https://imgur.com/a/VmJaqGY).

Move 3: [Touch your elbows behind your back](https://imgur.com/gallery/v5kNu7f).

Most of the kids could do 1 and 2, and they were laughing at each other's struggles to do 3.

After a while, their video started and they moved on to more important things.

The next morning at work, I was curious to see if I could do the stretches. I stood in front of the full length mirror in my office and tried them. 1 was a little tough, especially in a button down shirt. 2 was easy and felt pretty good. 3 seemed to conflict with basic human anatomy. I tried different angles and wrist positions and didn't even come close.

While I was doing this, a young female co-worker comes over and asks what I'm doing much like I did the previous night. I explain the stretches and figure she'll have more work since she's younger and in better shape than me.

Stretch 1, no problem. Stretch 2, it's like she was born to do this. Then she tries to touch her elbows behind her back and the buttons of her blouse completely give up. I'm staring at her in the mirror with her shirt split open with nothing underneath. She looked shocked and embarrassed. She covered up and walked out of the room.

I run to the supply closet to grab a promotional t-shirt that we hand out at events and give it to her in her office. Then I go back to the room with the mirror to find her button, which I ended up sewing back on before anyone else made it to the office.

So last night me, my girlfriend (both 22) went out clubbing with her younger brother (18) to celebrate him being able to drink legally. We didn’t wanna pay for a hotel so we borrowed their parent’s little caravan and at about 3am we all went back to the caravan all very drunk. 

My girlfriend has a habit of getting VERY horny when she’s drunk, which normally is great, but she also has absolutely zero boundaries or logic when in that state beyond sexual urges. 

We had to share a double bed inside the caravan, obviously I was expecting us all to sleep straight away, but literally 2 minutes after we laid down my girlfriend was pulling my pants down, and she started to suck my dick. Her brother was on the other side of the bed, he was pretty drunk and saw this happening and just laughed at it, I felt kinda weird at the time but I was also pretty drunk and just let it happen. He obviously didn’t watch the whole time but he did look back and forth and kept laughing at it. 

Anyway it’s the morning now and they’re both still asleep and the regret is starting to sink in, I have no idea how I’m gonna look him in the eye after this, and I’m kinda just worried that this will have long term repercussions for him and her. Gonna be a fun day.

So I have recently become a father. My son is a week old and I have been home with mom and baby the whole time. Needless to say I was getting a little restless at home even with the lack of sleep that comes with a new kid. 

For obvious reasons my wife and I couldn’t pass the time in the bedroom as normal. Mainly due to the expected impact of childbirth. My son’s huge head didn’t help things. So I decided not to bother my wife and sleeping baby and slipped off to the bathroom with phone and lotion to discreetly take care of business. 

Perusing my go-to site I find the video of choice. First thing that pops up is an ad of a girl yelling “Oh Baby” with the volume on my phone at full blast. I quickly turn it down and proceed to business. 

I return to my wife in the living room and all I see is shock on her face as he holds my son looking worried. I ask “what’s wrong” fearing she is mad at me for taking care of business solo. She looked at me dead serious and said “Something whispered ‘Hey baby’ to our son after you left and now I’m freaked out.”

For some background my wife believes in ghosts/spirits as crazy as it sounds. She has told me about seeing odd things in our house and believing she heard people talking before. So this did not help and she is even more worried with our new addition. 

She is currently burning sage through our house to ‘remove the spirits.’ I don’t have the heart to tell her I was just horny and she overheard me watching porn.

See, here's the issue reddit, my boyfriend is a great guy. Funny, smart, incredibly hot, but there's just one thing that is so hard for me to look past. Whenever we have sex, he makes these noises that sound exactly like a minecraft villager. Usually I can just ignore it, but last night Idk what happened but I just couldn't.

I let out a little giggle and practically sprinted to the bathroom before I exploded with laughter. He heard and asked what was so funny, and I told him I just saw a funny post on my phone and that was that.

Well that brings us to this morning. I was hoping he wouldn't say anything, but of course he had to ask what I saw that was so funny. At this point I figured I just had to tell him the truth.  So I said ""Babe, I'm really sorry, but last night you made a really funny sound and I couldn't stop."" He's a good sport so he laughed, but then he asked me to describe it to him.

I had just begun a new job working in memory care at a senior center. I was excited about the job. I love helping people. But, on the day I was supposed to start training.... I had a bit of a stomach 'thing' going on. But I didn't want to call off so early in my employment.... so I took a big slurp of Pepto Bismol and went in.

The first half of the shift went fine. And, though I was a still queasy, I was alright. I was learning how to help the residents with meals, recreation, and all their daily functions.

My manager told me it was time to learn how to help them with bathroom functions. And that one of the residents, a 92 year old woman named ""Georgia"" needed to be changed. I gulped, but was ready. The residents needed help with this, and I'd provide the help.

My manager brought me into Georgia's room. She was lying on her bed, awake and smiling. My manager said: ""Georgia, we're here to change you. ""

Georgia smiled and said: ""That's nice.""

Manager said: ""I know you've not been feeling well, Georgia. is today any better?""

Georgia smiled and said ""That's nice."" My manager told me this is the only thing Georgia EVER said.

My boss lead me through the process of getting Georgia's pants off. The smell intensified. My stomach burbled. We opened Georgia's disposable adult undergarment.

Yeah. Georgia WAS NOT feeling well. Georgia had horible, volcanic diareahha. Georgia had messed herself. And the mess had creeped around to AND INTO her front.

My boss began the cleaning. Showing me how to gently clean the resident. She had me put my gloves on and told me I was to finish cleaning Georgia. At this point, my stomach was NOT doing well. But I was determined. The residents needed me.

Gloves on, wet wipes in hand. Cleaning Georgia's outsides was managable. I was queasy, but it was managable. Then my boss pointed out I was not done. That, some of the diareahha had gone into Georgia's vagina. And I would have to clean that out.

I should mention at this point that I am a gay man. And that this was my very first experience with a vagina. And, while I'm totally vagina-positive... and not adversant.... I was not prepared to deal with a brown liquid filled vagina. Not when I was dealing with nausea.

I vomited. I know I should have felt it coming and turned away. But I didn't. The vomit happened suddenly and withouyt warning. And it went onto and into her vagina.

Georgia just smiled and said:  ""That's nice.""

My boss then said something for which I will always be grateful. Even though her lips were pursed and I could tell she was disgusted and upset, she only said: ""If you're vomiting, you need to go home. Now. I'll take care of this.""

I took off my gloves. I went home. I went back the next day and gifted my boss with a bunch of candy bars.

I (28m) started having sex in my mid teens, but stopped having sex in my early 20s, specifically after my first real relationship came to an end. I was 22. I never thought it would affect me as bad as it did for as long as it did. But from 22 until recently, I've been avoiding relationships, even casual hookups. As you can imagine, I did what most people do when they're alone and horny, I masturbated. For 6 fucking years. 

A few weeks ago I finally said enough is enough and decided to start dating again. After several unsuccessful dates and almost reverting back to my antisocial ways, I managed to make a connection. She was cute, funny, covered in freckles and I loved it. Towards the end of our first date we agreed to continue the fun at her place. Based on our body language, sex was definitely on the table. One of my biggest fears was cumming almost instantly due to the 6 years of zero sex. 

However, the opposite became my biggest challenge. I wasn't cumming at all. I could practically see the seasons change while I was fucking. That's how long it felt. After thrusting longer than I've ever thrusted in my life, I pulled out and apologized to my date. She seemed as relieved as I was to stop. We were both complaining about being sore. I explained my 6 year situation and made her understand that she did nothing wrong. It was all me. 

She understood and said it must be ""death grip"". I never heard of it before, but when she explained it to me, it made sense. I Googled how to overcome death grip and the number one treatment plan was masturbate less. I opted for not masturbating at all and guess what? It didn't help. No money shot. I had sex with the same freckle-faced girl for 3 weeks and I think her vagina fucking hates me. Yesterday we were supposed to meet up but she called to tell me she's no longer interested in seeing me because I've made it uncomfortable for her to walk properly. 

I masturbated this morning just to see if I can still cum and the answer is yes. I've literally trained my dick to hate sex and now I seemed to have lost a potential girlfriend. 

Tl;dr Avoided sex and masturbated for most of my 20s and now I'm unable to orgasm during sex and I'm losing potential relationships in the process.

tfmgp8,"TIFU by talking my wife into getting 23&me
TIFU Current wife and I were both married previously and both had 3 children each. We went to hs together in a small town. Both of our families are well known in the area with deep roots (both families been here a long time). Last year I got my wife a ancestry DNA kit as a gift because she wanted to know more about her European roots then her sister decided to do the same.  When their results were posted it started making family connections which included my mother, my oldest son, my uncle etc.  Wife's mom comes in the room so they ask her how we could be related. Her mom starts crying and says that when she was very young she overheard someone say ""Tom"""" isn't your father, ""Jimmy"" is. Her mom being from older generation says she just put it out of her mind and convinced herself it's just rumor.  

 I call my mom asked if she's ever heard a rumor that her father could be my wife's mother's father as well.  She gets quite for a moment and says yes I have and it was believed to be true by her mom as well and that her dad (my grandfather) was a well known cheater/womanizer. 

 We look further into the information on 23&me and it literally says that my wife and my oldest son share a great grandparent. More of us are now getting test on the same platform but it appears a WW2 Era secret has come to light.

TL;DR wife gets DNA test, discover decades old secret, turns out I married my 1st cousin

Edit: 1:to clear all kids are from both of 1st marriage 

2:my mom and wife's mom are apparently half sister's 

3: wife's mother is quite upset

4: WW2 was hard on everyone 
     (Trying to not make a joke here)

EDIT 2: At first wife was laughing about this but I'm afraid that the reality of it is caught up to her. Personally I think she's reading to far into it.

 I wasn't aware of how prevalent this particular taboo fetish is,  some of yall are freaks. Maybe once this is settled I can have some fun with it. 

 As I stated all kids are from previous marriages, we're in our mid 40s and will not be having anymore.

 We're definitely not in Alabama but we may have to move there now.

 Yes we're very much in love and will be staying that way.  Although we probably won't be sharing this information with too many other people...guess we'll keep in the family.",tifu,2691
v66vzz,"TIFU by letting my boyfriend eat my ass.
So my boyfriend kept telling me how excited he gets when thinking about eating ass.

I’ve always been against it but his constant repetition got me wondering what it would feel like so we decided to give it a go.

During foreplay he asked me again if he could eat my ass and I said yes.

It felt so weird, got my abs tensing up.

While licking down there 🍑 he decided to start fingering it too, the saliva was working as lube so it wasn’t painful or anything but I was feeling like I was gonna poop.

I just ignored it and was just so lost pleasuring myself with my vibrator.

When I orgasmed, I heard my boyfriend shout as if he was in pain.

I was super stressed at this point, scared I might have pooped or something.

He took he face out and stared at me. It was covered in brown watery material and he ended up throwing up on me.

Guess I got food poisoning or something and ended up diarrhoea blasting him.

…

We discussed it after he had a shower. I wanted to cheer him up so I told him I enjoyed it except the poop part. He just sat there in shock for a while and told me he doesn’t want to eat my ass again for a while.

TL;DR I tried anal foreplay and ended up pooping in my boyfriend’s mouth.

Edit: As someone pointed out - “they were basically inducing peristalsis of both the inner and outer sphincter with the fingering and vibrator. Makes ya wanna poop.”

Good to know 👍

Edit 2: People who are saying that my boyfriend is toxic and manipulative clearly don’t know him.

I let him talk about his fantasies, it turns me on.

The world isn’t black and white and adults are capable of finding something previously unacceptable to them acceptable.

Edit 3: I keep getting spam from support saying someone reached out to them.

Just to make it clear, I’m not traumatised by this experience and find it slightly funny. No need to offer me emotional support in messages either 🙂",tifu,2655

This happened 3-4 hours ago today. So I’ve been with my current girlfriend for over a year a now and we got together six months after me and my ex broke up.

My girlfriend was out doing Christmas shopping today and I was having a relaxed day off of work so I decided with the place to myself to jerk off. 

Decided to put some porn on but after 40 minutes I was getting frustrated and couldn’t cum so when this happens I go to my ex’s nudes and videos she sent to me so I put some headphones and started going to one of her videos. 

My girlfriend came home but I couldn’t hear she came home so she walked over to me to get my attention or to like maybe start something clearly seeing what I was doing but she saw my ex’s face moaning on my phone and ran out shouting

She drove and isn’t answering her phone It’s been 3 hours and she still hasn’t come home what the fuck do I do to make this right

TLDR: my girlfriend of almost two years caught me jerking off to my ex’s nudes she left and I haven’t seen her

Edit: I’ve deleted all the videos and pictures and she messaged me just saying we will talk when I get home

Edit 2: Me and my GF talked so she thought I was video chatting with my ex I explained it was an old video and she said that was better than video chatting but she still was hurt so we talked it through we aren’t breaking up but I’m heading to my parents for Christmas and she’s going to hers for Christmas. I’ve given her the password to my phone and laptop and showed her they are all deleted but I’m sleeping on the couch till she feels comfortable having me in bed

Edit 3: This should be the final update we’ve decided couples counselling after Christmas would be a good idea for us moving forward. I know a lot of Redditors are gonna be mad she wants to work on things and I’m shocked she does. I feel like I’ve been given the biggest second chance ever.

wovplg,"TIFU reading a manuscript my ex gf wrote
A few days ago I (28m) got an email from my ex gf (25) with the subject line: ""I did it thanks to you!"". The email had an attachment. The attachment was a manuscript. The manuscript was an autobiography written by my ex gf. The title of the autobiography instantly took me back to the time when my ex gf and I were still dating. 

I was sexually inexperienced back in those days whereas my ex gf had more than enough sexual experience. We enjoyed talking about past relationships and what the sex was like. It was never ""a thing"" in our relationship. Just casual conversation. My ex gf had more stories to tell and all of them were entertaining. I remember joking about how she should someday write a book. We laughed, made love, and a few months later, our relationship came to an end. It was sad, but alas, life continued. 

We're now back in the present. I finished reading the manuscript an hour ago. There were 72 chapters. Each chapter was about an individual person my ex gf had known sexually. No real names were mentioned. Only character labels. Like The Surfer, The Biker, The Jock, The Older Man, etc. Some of the stories and ""characters"" I actually remembered based on the details my ex gf shared with me during our relationship. Others were totally new. But new or not, it was fun to read. Until I made it to Chapter 39. My chapter. ""The Turtle"". 

Keep in mind, all the sexual partners my ex gf mentioned in her manuscript had something specific about them that made the sex memorable for her. For example, The Surfer always smelled like the ocean, which never failed to turn her on. The Biker had gang tattoos from the neck down, but the one tattoo that always made her rip his clothes off was his pet hamster tattoo. Then there was me. A guy who couldn't swim, let alone surf, no tattoos, and with practically zero sexual experience at the time. What was so memorable about me? 

Well, according to my chapter, the answer was my ""adorably small penis"". My ex gf described how she had almost forgotten what it felt like NOT to choke during oral, before she met me. She compared my penis to the head of a baby turtle, thus my chapter and character name. Based on what I was reading, not only did I have the smallest penis compared to all the other people she's dated, but I also had the only penis that somehow managed to look ""too innocent"" for sex. 

It didn't come across as if my ex gf was purposefully trying to insult me, but come on, I think most people can understand what a sensitive topic penis size can be to any guy who's not hung like a horse. I still need to contact my ex gf and provide my feedback, but I'm gonna need some time to process what I read. It's not every day someone writes a book about your small dick. Welcome back, insecurities I didn't think I would have at this age. 

TL:DR Jokingly encouraged my ex gf to write a book about her adventurous sex life when we were still together. She wrote a manuscript years later and recently sent it to me. To my surprise (and horror), I was in said manuscript, and so was my ""adorably small penis"".",tifu,4430
vslrhh,"TIFU learning sign language
[Update.](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/vzli1b/tifu_learning_sign_language_update)

Throwaway account.

My mom's been involved with this new guy for a few months now. To be fair, enough time has passed for me to stop referring to him as the new guy, but he's not my dad and I guess that will always make him feel like the new guy. According to movie logic, I'm supposed to hate him for trying to replace my father or whatever, but the truth is, I like him. I like him so much that I've been learning how to use sign language to improve our communication because new guy happens to be Deaf. 

He can read lips, which is how I've been communicating with him. My mom didn't waste any time learning sign language at the beginning of their romance and she's at the point now where she can have full conversations without using her voice. I was really proud of her and so was new guy. I'm not on their level yet, but I've had enough practice to follow a conversation that's not too complicated. My plan was to surprise new guy on his birthday, which is 2 months from now, and wish him a happy birthday as well as officially welcoming him to the family in sign language. 

However, I never factored in the amount of dirty talk my mom and new guy were having in sign language. Not knowing that I can understand them, my mom and new guy have gotten disturbingly comfortable exposing their sex life in my company. It didn't matter if we were at the dinner table or watching tv, I would constantly catch so many dirty descriptions being communicated between the two of them. They are worse than horny teenagers, and I should know, I am one. No 17 year old son should ever witness his mother use her fingers to demonstrate how wet her vagina is. 

It's gotten to the point where I'm no longer willing to wait until new guy's birthday to make it known that I can understand sign language because HOLY FUCK I need my eyes to not see this shit anymore. 

This is an ongoing fuck up.

**Tl:dr The guy my mom's dating is Deaf. Because I like the dude, I decided to learn sign language in secret and was planning to surprise him on his upcoming birthday by communicating in sign language. Little did I know that secretly understanding sign language would expose me to disturbingly intimate conversations between my mom and the new man in her life.**",tifu,1056

I got his attention and jokingly pulled one boob out of my bathing suit top which is pretty normal for our relationship and didn’t realize his mom had come out of the bathroom and was almost directly next to me. She made a shocked face, he started cracking up, and I wanted to die. Needless to say, I won’t be flashing him with anyone around jokingly or not for a very long time.

w2t0n4,"TIFU by letting a delirious woman into my house thinking she had heat stroke. She was a mental patient from the hospital who proceeded to sit on my sofa and masturbate
This happened yesterday in the UK while we are going through the hottest heatwave on record. It's 4PM and I'm minding my own business in my back garden tidying my shed when i hear somebody trying to get into my back gate. I peek through the gap to see an elderly woman looking very hot and distressed, she notices me and starts shouting please help me, please help me. I can't open the gate, so I tell her to go to the front door. I ran through the house and told her to come in and take a seat while I get her a glass of water.  She's mumbling gibberish and rocking back and forth. Tells me she is lost. I suspected she had heat stroke and was suffering from delirium and exhaustion. Poor woman, thank god I saved her.

I pop upstairs to get a damp towel and the fan. When I return I find the woman sitting on my sofa, smoking a cigarette, masturbating. Great.

""You can't do that"" I yell in bemusement but she carries on, telling me how nice it feels. ""Can you lick my clitoris?"" she asks, to which I said no way and she needs to leave. ""Do you have a dog?"" I see my chance to get her out of the house. ""Yes I have a dog, come with me"" and I managed to get her up and out into the garden.

She collapses onto the floor. Making gagging noises, telling me she's going to die, still with her hand between her legs. It is 40 degrees and I myself am struggling to be fair, so I know she will be in trouble if I don't get her out of the heat. 

I call 999, they take 5 minutes to answer, and eventually they tell me there are no ambulances. ""Is she breathing... is she conscious... OK then, if she passes out, put her in the discovery position and fan her, then call us back and we will try to hurry up.""

She keeps asking for the dog and that she wants us both to make love to her. When I try to move her into the house she keeps grabbing me and trying to kiss me. What the hell am I going to do?  
The hospital is a 5 minute walk, so I make the decision to get her there by carrying her or she is going to die from heat stroke. So I tell her I know a really nice dog across the road and I'm going to take her to it. Her eyes light up and she heads with me out of the garden. 

I get her to put her leggings on and begin to walk to the hospital while being sexually assaulted the whole way. 999 rings me back and I tell them the plan. The closest door is the ear and throat department or something like that, so I carry her in there where there is air conditioning and sit her down. I shout for help and a nurse appears, she fetches some water and I leave her in their capable hands. They all seemed to know who she was and apparently she had been on the mental ward. As I walk out she yells ""Where is this dog to lick my clitoris??""  The nurses look puzzled, I shrug my shoulders and walk out. 

I return home, lock all the doors and gates, and have a shower to wash the woman's sweat and fanny juice off me. I've not seen her today, hope she is feeling better.

If the mods so wish I can verify the story with video evidence as my house has Nest cameras, but I won't post these publicly for obvious reasons. 

TLDR: I let a delirious woman into my house thinking she had heat stroke. She turned out to be a mental patient from the hospital who proceeded to masturbate on my sofa and sexually assault me

Throwaway for obvious reasons.

So I went to the flea market and found some cool stuff like a Didgeridoo and an old Gameboy advance. But something else struck me. A microscope for only 5 bucks.

It was in great condition and still had all the little extras since it was made for kids. As soon as I got home, i needed to examine everything. So I grabbed a thin slice of cucumber, and than a leaf. I was astonished how well it worked given that it was for kids. I then used a drop of blood, and you could see the red blood cells in all their glory.

So I thought what every guy probably would have done. I know it's no nut November, but i was eager to look at my future children while they were still inside my balls. So I pulled up a nice video from my girlfriend and started to masturbate. I managed it to catch all of my cum in a petri dish, and used a pipette to add a bit to the microscope slide. I was so excited. 

As I slowly upped the magnification, i needed to adjust the focus. And there I saw my sperm. But it wasn't moving. Not one bit. I was shocked and didn't knew what to do. So I made an appointment at my urologist to make an infertility test. And now k know it officially that I'm indeed infertile.

He lays on his side so the easiest thing to do was to give him a gentle stroke. He started stiffening but didn't really stir. He loves me licking his balls so I tried to give them a lick.

It wasn't easy without him helping to manoeuvre into the right position. I lifted his leg a bit and got a good angle. He started to stir and shift. So I sat back until he settled more on his front but still on his side. 

I was clearly in quite a determined mood and I tried to get to his balls from behind through his raised leg. 

As I was trying to get in there again he let out a massive fart. Just instantly stinky, inches from my nose. I saw it before I felt it and I felt it before I smelt it but there was nothing I could do to save myself. So gross. Wouldn't recommend! He's not even that windy. It was bad luck.

s7rpk0,"TIFU by telling my wife a fake fact to mess with her...
This happened almost 15 years ago, and came back to bite me today, which is why it's a TIFU:

My wife loves Christmas songs, and she looooves to sing them. 15 Years ago, we were on a holiday car ride and she decided to pass the time by singing ""The Christmas Song"" over, and over again, and me being me decided to fuck with her just to be funny.

When she got to ""Jack Frost nipping at your nose"", I blanched and asked her why she was singing THAT song, in an absolutely mortified voice.

When she looked confused, I feigned surprise that she was unaware of her faux pas and proceeded to  inform her that like many a Grimm's Fairy Tale, Christmas songs often have a dark past and that ""Jack Frost"" was the name of a mental patient from the 20's who broke out of an Asylum during a Christmas break and went around devouring faces, particularly noses, to which he had acquired a taste for.

She bought it hook, line, and sinker. She was shocked, horrified that people would sing about it, and we talked about it for the duration of the ride, Jack Frost's antics growing darker and darker as the miles flew by.

Fast-forward to this morning: I'm in a good mood, it's super snowy, and I have snow-blow the driveway. As I'm getting dressed, I start singing ""The Christmas song"" and she chastises me in a teasing voice.

I had NO idea what she was talking about. She then confides that Jack Frost, the serial nose biter had forever ruined that song for her, and she can no longer stand it.

I laugh and explain that I was teasing that day, and I honestly didn't think she believed me.

She got mad. MAD mad.

Apparently, this has been her go-to-fact during the holidays, and for the last 15 years has shared this dark and gruesome tidbit with anyone who would listen. I guess a sea of confused and disbelieving looks and a flashback of people staring at her as if SHE were a nose biter came back to haunt her as the lie she had been spreading for years came back in a moment of dawning comprehension.

She's mad and a little hurt, and I am apparently the King of Lies who is never to be trusted again.


TL;DR - I told my wife that a Christmas song was about a serial face eater, and she spread that gospel like it was handed down on a stone tablet.

scvavj,"TIFU by cleaning my son’s(13m) bedroom and finding my girlfriend’s(31f) dirty underwear
Let me start by saying she is not his mother! As any parent does, I tell my son to give me all his dirty laundry (mostly so I don’t have to touch it) so I can wash them for him. 

One day he was not home, so, I went into his room and grabbed his dirty laundry. I notice a balled up towel in the corner of his closet and I just grabbed the end of it, thinking it was just a towel, nope! Out falls 2 of my girlfriends recently worn/dirty underwear! I stand there coming up with crazy scenarios in my head for a second like “must have gotten caught in the towel when he was done showering” or “maybe it got messed up in the clean laundry”. Then the realization hits me that our laundry basket is in the bathroom where we shower. 

All I could say to my girlfriend was “we are about to have a weird conversation and I’m sorry”. I pull out the underwear and say “I found these in (insert son’s name) room” and her jaw just drops. 
I didn’t know what else to say besides “at least we know he likes you”

Now it is a little weird and quiet around my house. The worst part is, I don’t know how to bring it up to him!

TL;DR: found my girlfriend’s underwear in my teenage son’s bedroom when I was just looking for laundry. Now there is a weird silence when my girlfriend encounters my son.

UPDATE 1: The decision has been made to sit him down tonight after dinner. Im going to be short and sweet about it. Tell him that I’ll love him no matter what. Tell him why it wasn’t ok to violate my GFs privacy! Then take the opportunity to see if he wants to talk about anything, but not force him to. 

OFF TOPIC: To the guy who messaged me asking to trade my girlfriends dirty underwear for his SISTERS! You’re disgusting!

UPDATE 2: Ok, so here is the update everyone is waiting for! First of all, my decision was not based off any “bro code”. I feel it is my job to mold the best young man. Also, to those suggesting that I should not have told my girlfriend, her privacy was invaded and it’s only right she knows. If he didn’t want to be embarrassed about it, he shouldn’t have done it. I decided to talk to him about it when it was time to drag the trash barrels out to the street. After we each dragged a barrel and we’re walking back I said “listen buddy, I’ll love you no matter what, BUT I found what was in your bedroom in the towel. You’re lucky it was me who found it and not her! That’s extremely inappropriate and not ok, do not ever invade a woman’s privacy like that. Especially, not a girl who has never consented to you in a sexual way. Do we understand each other?!”

He just dropped his head and said “sorry dad” and I just completely dropped it and said “don’t forget the last barrel and went inside.

UPDATE 3: here are some of the messages I’ve gotten! 

“I’ve been in a similar position”  
Either by sons or moms that have gone through this, THANK YOU to these people! Perspective truly helps in situations like these! 

“Does your GF have onlyfans” 😂🤔😟
She better not!!! 

“What he is doing is normal. Please leave him alone” 
No, I appreciate your opinions though! 🤥

My gf woke up to me standing on the bed completely naked and continuing to do the invisible hula hoop dance. She grabbed a blanket and left the bedroom. I have no idea how long I was dancing on the bed, but I must have exhausted myself and passed out because I remembered nothing else afterwards other than waking up alone in bed this morning and finding my gf sleeping in the living room. 

When my gf opened her eyes, I was standing by with breakfast and an apology, which my gf was grateful for. However, she broke up with me. Last night was ""too much frat boy"" for her liking. Apparently she expected an ""older guy"" like me to be more mature. I'm 22. She's 19. What the fuck. Anyway, she left. I really liked her.

uyh8uc,"TIFU by eating the hottest peppers I could find while having no sense of taste or smell due to COVID.
My FU happened 3 days ago and I’ve just now recovered enough to relive it. 

I got COVID for the second time over the weekend and by Monday I had lost all sensation of taste and smell. At the peak of the pandemic I’d joked with my brother in law about running a hot pepper gauntlet if I ever lost my sense of taste and smell from COVID because I *heard* you could handle spicy things. 

Mind you, I’ve always loved spicy things, but habaneros are usually the hottest I can go. So I started with those, because why not?  And nothing. So I thought, let’s just jump right into one called the Death Spiral, which is hotter than a ghost pepper but not as hot as a Carolina Reaper. 

This is the moment where I think I can pinpoint where my fuck up happened. Nothing. No taste, no spice. So I IMMEDIATELY threw two Carolina reaper peppers down followed by about 10-15 pieces of habaneros and death spiral peppers. About halfway through, my body started to retaliate. I was sweating. I was numb, I felt like I was going to die. But the burn wasn’t there. Until it was. It’s hard to describe. 

Anyway, I suffered through the night with awful indigestion and took antacids to try to calm it.  I was miserable. 

I didn’t think it could get any worse, but then the moment came where I had to evacuate them. And my god, the pure fire and rage that my sphincter had was unbearable. It felt like satan himself was trying to claw his way out of my rectum. I swore I’d shat blood, but there was none. For hours afterwards I swear the fire feeling that came from my exit hatch could have made s’mores for the entire family. I’m still in pain days later. 

TL;dr - lost taste and smell due to COVID, thought it was a good idea to eat the hottest peppers I could find. Paid the price when satan escaped from my ass. 0/10, would not recommend.

Edit: [UPDATE](https://www.reddit.com/user/HeyItsYonder/comments/ujzpso/update/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) is posted on my profile


I (29M) work in digital marketing. Company held party to celebrate the completion of big project. As I was walking to my car, I noticed a drunk female coworker (mid 30s). We worked together for 3 years, but it's a big department and I don't know much about her. 

She was having difficulty walking. I offered to help and she held out her hand. I asked if she drove here. She took an Uber. Helped her call another one as she vomited. Uber driver arrived, saw the condition she was in, and took off without saying a word. Understandable. 
 
I decided to drive her home. I have a duel front and rear dashcam setup. I moved the rear camera, placed it in front, and adjusted angle to make sure inside of vehicle is covered (lifesaver). 

Fast forward one month to April 25 (last week) and I was called into HR. My manager was sitting with a serious expression. They asked what I did after the party. I immediately became defensive and asked what the meeting is about. 

HR person said that they received a complaint from an employee accusing me of inappropriate behavior. I responded, ""I have no idea what you are talking about. I did nothing inappropriate during or after that party. Whoever complained has the wrong guy!""

They stepped out into the hallway for a couple minutes. I'm starting to sweat even though I did nothing wrong. Thinking, I remember giving coworker a ride home. That must be it. They step back into the office, manager says they have a witness who saw me put drunk coworker into my car. 

I said, ""Yea, I drove her home. Nothing happened...and I did not 'put' her in. She accepted the help."" Silence. They stare at me like I'm guilty. Nothing but suspicion and judgement. HR says they'll continue investigating and will speak to me the following week.

I received an email today, telling me to make a statement for the police and that I'm suspended until the case is dismissed. I'm pissed. Really pissed.

I hired an attorney and submitted statement to police. After asking around, I learned the coworker I gave a ride to is apparently the ex-wife of my manager's golfing buddy. Yea. 

Little does the company know I protected myself with dashcam footage as well as a short cell phone video of me walking her to the house. I am innocent and will fight this.

TL;DR - I drove drunk coworker home. Accused of inappropriate behavior one month later. Suspended by my company while they investigate. I hired attorney and have video footage proving my innocence.",tifu,2538

This happened yesterday, but I didn't realize what I had done until this morning.

I was in the car running errands with my four year old son when he suddenly asks, ""Why are some people Joul-ish on Christmas?"" I vaguely remembered him watching some cartoons where bad guys want to steal Christmas, and I figured he meant ""jealous."" So I told him, ""Well, those people are not nice, and they're greedy, and they want all the toys for themselves and not share, and I don't want you to be like that at all."" He seemed to accept this and the conversation moved to something else.

This morning my husband asked me if I told our son that Jewish people wanted all the toys to themselves. I immediately realized what happened. My son's daycare celebrated Hannukah last week by coloring menorahs and making dreidels and he was curious about Jewish people.

uixxqr,"TIFU By volunteering to research and report back to my (VERY) conservative pro-life family the cause of my grandmother’s mysterious death at the age of 32. She died following an incomplete and (then) illegal abortion in 1958.
My paternal grandmother’s death in 1958 at the age of 32 has always been shrouded in mystery.  


Throughout the years, there have been various bits of hearsay that have lead to theories and speculation of her dying of the flu, hepatitis, a heart attack, appendicitis, etc.


After another recent round of speculation at a family gathering, I volunteered to take the lead in researching  the exact cause of her death, if such could be determined.  Further, I offered to report any findings back to all, so as to finally put the speculation and matter to rest. 


After some digging on ancestry.com, I found both her and the actual copy of her death certificate, and which lists “Sepsis(?)” and “Incomplete abortion, infected.” as the cause(s) of death. 


I’ve checked and re-checked the information - it exactly matches her in every category…name, maiden name, DOB, location of birth, address, mother’s name, father’s name, date of death, city / county / state of death, etc. etc. 


It’s 100% her.  


This is 100% her death certificate. 


I’ve included a link to the image of her redacted death certificate both for any who wish to see it, but also to serve as proof of the veracity of my claim and sincerity in posing my question. 


The problem is that my family is extremely conservative, very religious, and not unexpectedly, very (VERY) pro-life.  Needless to say, this news will no doubt be extremely upsetting to multiple generations of my immediate and extended family - and which still includes some of her living children, and my aunts and uncle.  


What if my telling them only further injures my grandmother’s already tragic tale by sullying her memory in the minds of her living relatives?  This is far and away my greatest concern. 



I’m not sure what to say, if anything, or how best to do so.  I’ve sat in this information for a little more than a week, weighing my options on the best path forward.  For their part, they’re all understandably and anxiously waiting and wanting to know what I’ve found, and regularly asking me for updates. 



[Paternal Grandmother’s Death Certificate ](https://i.imgur.com/ZBAquao.jpg)



TL;DR  Volunteered to research and report back on exact cause of grandmother’s death to VERY conservative / pro-life family (immediate and extended), and discovered that it resulted from an incomplete and (then) illegal abortion.  I’ve now got to figure out whether or not to say anything, and if so, what.

EDIT - Some quick info that might be helpful, by the comments.  

Her family (her, my grandfather, four kids (app. 17, 15, 14 and my father was 9) lived in ~~abstract~~ abject poverty.  They’d regularly skip meals for days until they had enough money to buy more food.  Because my grandfather would not accept help of any kind, my grandmother would sneak garden-grown food given to her by her sisters who lived nearby.  

All agree that she was very sick and suffered with a high fever for some days before she sought medical attention. 


Early into her illness / ailment, her sister found her struggling to do laundry on one of those roll-top machines on the back porch and had to take her inside and put her to bed for fear that she was about to pass out.


She stayed in bed and my grandfather prohibited anyone from entering the room, and he alone saw and spoke to her.  Some believed that he limited contact out of fear that she was somehow contagious. He told the kids and her sisters that she only needed rest. 

On the second or third day, sometime before lunch, an ambulance was summoned to the home.  This was immediately understood to be an extraordinary measure, given its cost.  

Only my grandfather accompanied her in the ambulance, and urged no one to come to visit her once admitted to the hospital. Instead, he told the older kids to look after the younger in their absence. The sisters of my grandmother, my great aunts, immediately came to be with the children.  

My father, then age 9 and the youngest child, recalls seeing them wheel his mother out of the house on a gurney, and gently waving to him as she was being placed into the rear of the ambulance.  It was the last time he would see her alive.  

Later that night, my grandfather returned home alone and informed the family that she had died. 

Accounts vary, but my grandfather essentially refused to leave their bedroom for a number of days after her death, except to use the outhouse and to attend her funeral services, and which her sisters prepared and arranged, while also caring for the kids.  

Despite remarrying another woman less than a year later, and being married to her for 50+ years, he never moved her clothes and shoes out of their closet, and forbid anyone else from doing so, even until his death in 2010 or so. 

My grandmother’s death had far-reaching implications for her family, essentially fracturing it, and which causes consequences still dealt with today.  

My father developed a drinking problem a few years after my grandmother’s passing, with such only being greatly accelerated and further exacerbated by a tour in Vietnam, and which lead to his untimely death in the early 90’s.  

In a very real sense, my children never knew their grandfather because of the tragic events that occurred with my grandmother’s tragic passing.

Also edited “abstract” for “abject”.

I have requested an autopsy report from the State Chief Medical Examiner.  Will update if any such report exists, and if so, it’s findings.

A couple of days ago my wife had a dream where I cheated on her and later leaving her to live with the other woman. She told me about her dream in the morning, clearly distressed. Trying to defuse the situation, I decided to create a funny origin story of the girl I was seeing in her dream. I named her Brumhilda, as this name doesn't exist where we live and I thought it added volume and certain mystery to her character.

So, the obligatory “this happened before my wife recently gave birth to our 2nd child, and hormones were off the charts”.

My very pregnant wife wakes up and I am already awake, having made coffee for myself and prepared tea in anticipation for a relaxed morning.   I’m watching a PBS special about WWII submarines and she sat down with her tea and started to watch.   

So my wife isn’t a huge history buff and I am constantly reminding her of the order of commonly-known events.   She is incredibly intelligent but she apparently had a very boring history teacher and never absorbed the information.  As such, she had no idea that submarines
were actually torpedo-carrying murder machines that were designed to blow up their enemies.  

I look at her and she’s bawling…tears running down her face and she says, “But I thought submarines were just like for exploration and fun and stuff.”  I chalk it up to hormones, but I really ruined a nice morning.

TL;DR made my pregnant wife cry when she found out that submarines are war machines

Edit:

Wow, went to sleep and this got a bit hairy.   Thank you to those who understand pregnancy brain and found this as cute, albeit shocking as I did. No thank you to those who went straight to calling my wife horrible things or assuming anything else about her, and a big FU to those saying anything mean about my kids.  Without going into much detail, yes, she had a sheltered childhood where she didn’t encounter submarines all too often, in the water, on land, or in the media.  I guess her parents never gave her the “submarine talk”.  She does in fact know a lot more about the grisly details of war now, as we have been trying to get her up to date, especially about the world wars.  She may have had an inkling before that submarines were evil, but I don’t think it was something she wanted to hear that morning.  Pretty sure she thought they were used in war, but just for spying on the enemy. Be nice, and may you all keep your heads above water.",tifu,2317
seaoa3,"TIFU when I pulled a deaf woman over for speeding and asked to see her Vagina
Well for starters this was several years ago when I was a young police officer in a college town in the South. I am retired now. 
To set this up our department had been teaching us American Sign Language to help officers serve the public. I was all about learning sign language and picked some up pretty quickly, or so I thought. 
Well one night in the summer I am on traffic enforcement looking for drunk drivers and about 1am I stop a car for speeding. As approach the car a young and very pretty co-ed was driving. I start talking to her but she indicates that she is Deaf. Now I still had the ASL for police officers class from a week ago fresh in my mind and I think to myself “great I get to use a new talent in the field”. 
I indicate that I can sign and she smiles, so far so good! Now I need to add that I was nervous since this was the first time I had used this on the street and she was very pretty. 
I then sign that I needed to see her drivers license. A look of terror crossed her face and my cop radar went off.  I was thinking what have I stumbled upon. I had dealt with people that didn’t have a license, were dangerous, were drunk, or had warrants. 
I again sign that I am a police officer and I needed to see her drivers license now and put my cop face on. I also remembered that to a deaf person the look on your face is equivalent to your tone of voice and apparently I was near screaming with my look. 
Now to add to this it is 1am, it is very dark on a side street and I am 6’2 230 lbs. and she is about 5’2 and maybe 100lbs. 
This poor girl was FREAKED OUT! 
I finally realize I haven’t stopped a serial killer and simply ask “well why?” To which she looks down at her crotch and shakes her head violently NO. 
Well my little pea brain begins to gather information in and I realize that I had been lazy in signing the sign for drivers license and instead had been signing “ I am a police officer, show me your vagina!”
I still cringe at that and I must have lit up the road with the 1.1 gigawatts red face and the look of embarrassment/horror caught her off guard (well she was on guard 100% at that point) and she realized that I wasn’t a rouge police officer using my authority to sexually assault her on a dark street, but just a cop that sucked at ASL. Well she started laughing at me and it had to be the relief she felt mixed the humor of what I did. It took several minutes to compose herself and I just stood there and took it looking  as sheepish as I ever have. I earned every second of her laughing. I just kept apologizing over and over (I’m glad I got that one right at least)
Needless to say she DID NOT get a ticket but a story about this well meaning but dumb police officer that severely messed up a traffic stop.

This happened 2 weeks ago:
I (f) met my friend's (m) fiance a couple of months ago when he moved with her back to his home town. The fiance and I got on well enough and we tentatively started to form a friendship.
The night before their wedding, my friend stayed over at his brother's. 
I stayed the night at their house with the bride. She had no friends or family in town and I was by default the bridesmaid.
Feeling kind of sorry for her for not having had a Bachelorette party or anyone around, I suggested that we go out to have a few drinks, celebrate her last few hours of singlehood. 
She agreed. I ordered a beer and a tequila each for the first round, thinking that we'd start with a shooter, have a few beers and end off with a shooter, nothing wild. I didn't want to be the cause of a severely hungover bride.
After the first tequila hit her stomach, she changed, became more animated, I put it down to just pre-wedding excitement.
No one told me that she was a recovering addict who hasn't had a drink in 4 years. No one. 
In the past when I visited, my friend and myself would drink beer and she wouldn't, I always thought that it was because she wasn't particularly fond of beer or alcohol. I have lots of girl friends like that, who will only drink on certain occasions.
But I like beer - (the Hon. Brett Kavanaugh)

The bride started chugging beers and shooters like a fratboy. I tried to stop her, she wouldn't listen to reason. She became more and more aggressive, so I just backed off. Had I known then what I know now, I would've made a bigger effort, even if that may have meant a black eye or bloody nose for me.

As Murphy would have it, she chose the exact moment to go to the restroom as a girl who was doing lines in the stall next to hers. The bride asked and got given. Anything for the Bride, right? 'Oh my gawd, oh wonderful, you're getting married tomorrow, here's another'
The night went downhill from there. She was like a freight train, with me barely hanging on.
She phoned her husband-to-be and told him that the wedding was off, that she's changed her mind.
I felt like dog-shit.

I eventually managed to get her home at around 04h00. He was waiting for her. She screamed at him and he shouted at me. 
They postponed the wedding.

I feel so, so bad.  I never wanted to cause shit for either one of them.

That thought was on my mind this morning when I woke up next to my wife. The morning sunlight made her skin glow with an aura I'm sure one could only see through my eyes.

I shuffled over to her side of the bed, trying to be as gentle as I could. I wanted to preserve that moment but I couldn't resist the urge to be closer to her.

I settled in with my head laying next to hers and looking directly into her beautiful blue eyes. Her closed lids could never hide what I know to be the most lovely pair of eyes I've ever seen.

She must have felt me there because her eyes began to slowly open.

Just when I thought I couldn't feel any more content in my life, she smiles at me.

I smile right back at her and with the thought of communication on my mind I promptly said "" You don't let me spoon with you while we sleep because you'll fart on my dick right?""

We ended up talking in the same circle and he introduces himself. We start chatting and quickly find the circle around us has disappeared and it is just us. 

He is so smart, his smile is outrageously cute, and I love how he seems laser focused on me instead of one of the many attractive women that have now joined the party and are talking about their cool Raya dates. 

As the night wore on, I found myself talking to various different groups, but, each time this guy would appear again and we'd end up just talking to each other again. Someone who neither of us knew came up and said we made an attractive couple, and I realized somehow in the span of two hours we were already acting like a couple. It wasn't just being sexually attracted to him, I felt so comfortable around him and he was so attentive to my needs. 

I told him offhand I had allergies to the dog at the party. Hours later when I started sneezing he immediately knew why and moved us outside. His smile was the thing that immediately caught my attention but it was the thoughtfulness that made it so at the end of the night, we catch an Uber home together and end up kissing. Before the Uber drops him off I give him my number. 

Sunday comes, don't hear from him. Ok, ok, I get it, we both got home at 4am and I too just want to sleep the day away. 

Monday comes. Silence. 

Tuesday, even more silence. I know I've read how it is ""uncool"" to text a girl immediately because you want to seem super cool and wanted, but we're both in our mid-thirties and, I hoped, realized these mind games are bullshit. If you like someone, text them when you can. Life is too short to be with people half-interested in you. 

Wednesday comes and I'm a mixture of angry and over it and insecure all at the same time. How dare he lead me on like this! ...Well, I guess I'm glad I only wasted one night on this asshole....was I not pretty enough? All these thoughts raced through my head and coalesced into me typing his name and work place into Google to see if I can find him. 

Turns out, he was incredibly easy to find. I was planning on just looking at him because I missed his face, but I accidentally clicked the link that brought me to his LinkedIn page. Yikes! Now he'll know that I stalked him which made me feel even worse. >.< I probably looked crazy. 

Welp, since I was already on his page I guess I'd look at where he had worked. Maybe he wasn't really interesting and I'd feel better about him ghosting me. 

Nope, turns out he is not only very smart but also humble because his resume listed a dozen different cool jobs, impressive schools he's attended, things he's worked on. Great, I probably wasn't impressive enough for him. -_- 

Not thirty minutes later he friends me on LinkedIn, but seems surprised that I was reaching out. He had evidently texted me that night, and again the next day, only to not hear anything back. I had ghosted him. 

And this is how we found out my fuck up. When I gave him my number, turns out I was off by a digit. Turns out, tipsy me isn't so great at typing or proofreading. 

If I hadn't been a creepy LinkedIn stalker, it could have been months, if ever, before we would have seen each other again. Right now we're laughing about it and setting up our first real date. Wish me luck Reddit!

I promptly turn off the movie I’m watching and we head to bed. I barely have time to get undressed before she says goodnight and rolls over. Now this struck me as odd because this woman gets RIDICULOUSLY horny when she been drinking. But I guess not tonight. Rather frustrated I climb into bed and try to write it off as her just being over tired and over served. Well I’m just about asleep when her phone loudly goes off startling me back into consciousness. Seeing no reaction from her, and knowing her notification will go off at least one more time unless it is dealt with, I reach over and grab it to flip the silent mode button. And here’s where shit gets fucked up. You see the notification was triggered by a text. A text from a guy who picked her up tonight, from some other random guys house bc random guy was super drunk and she was scared. His text, “Goodnight darling.” 

What followed was me doing what I’ve never done, but obviously should have, a deep dive into her phone activity. What I found is as follows: she’s fucked at least one of my, now former, friends. She is involved in an emotional affair with a friend of hers from college (also married) who seemed VERY eager to take advantage of his wife’s absence so that he could spend time with mine (He was the noble knight who rescued her from rando drunk guy) And she has an impressively active tinder profile. Oh yeah and at one point this evening it seems she briefly considered hitching a ride with a stranger to Colorado. The texts, snaps and dms took about an hour to get through. 

So now I’m sitting here, house quiet, nauseous and internally raging, drinking cheap beer, trying to figure out how we got here. I’d wake her up to confront her, but the kids are asleep and I just don’t have the energy to fight tonight. There’s 6 years down the fuckin drain bois.

Today around 11:30, I got a call from my oldest daughter teacher saying she was in agony, that she vomited all over the floor and is in the nurse's office being assessed. I immediately knew what I did, left work and rushed to the school. I stopped at a gas station to get some whole milk and some thick milk chocolate to try and help her. I've heard chocolate works but never had the misfortune to try it. When I got there, the nurse had figured out what had happened and I got an earful from her about the dangers of spicy food for young kids and I could have done some damage. I agreed and I just let her go off on me while I was comforting my daughter becuase frankly....I deserved it.  

I explained what happened to the principal who wanted to fill out and incident report. He was understanding that mistakes happen but also said this mistake could have been worse. Again, I agreed. Im so embarrassed.

When I told my wife what had happened when she got home, she went to comfort our daughter, jokingly called me a huge moron, (I agreed) and we had a bit of a laugh with my 2 daughters over it.  My daughter has since recovered and I've learned a valuable lesson. 

Don't make radioactive sandwiches around food for your kids!

u5stcu,"TIFU by letting family back into my life, unaware that I had won the lottery years prior
So backstory. I, (36M) am the youngest of 5 children (boy-girl-boy-girl-boy) and we grew up in absolute poverty. Mom loved having kids but she didn't work and dad didn't make enough to support everyone. Poor enough that I remember as an 11 or 12 year old receiving a single plastic slinky and being absolutely thrilled I got anything.

Growing up with that kind of family was rough, parents got divorced and dad lived locally but didn't really do much to try to be a dad. Just support financially when legally necessary, and he let it slip once to me that he never wanted any kids. He just loved my mom and she wanted kids so he went along with it. Obviously with this kind of dynamic and the absolute lack of resources, home life wasn't great prior to the divorce.

I was helping fix drywall at like 5 years old because we could only afford to live in crumby run down houses. I remember stripping paint with a steamer and putty knife at about 6 or 7 and only learned recently that the house had lead paint. Oldest siblings did even more housework and probably inhaled a bunch of lead dust and toxic substances. Couple that with the emotional abuse of our parents and they didn't grow up to be good people.

My oldest brother had anger issues and got kicked out of college for fighting people. He also got arrested a few times for stuff involving theft or violence. Oldest sister struggled with substance abuse, got arrested a few times, ended up involuntarily committed for 72hrs once. She's doing a lot better nowadays but still an unpleasant person. Next brother went on to just be an employee at a large chain store where I think he might be a manager now. All 3 still live in the impoverished town we grew up in.

My next sister and I are close enough in age that we're very similar. Both joined the military to escape the poverty trap of our hometown. I joined the Army and she went Navy, even at about the same time. While in the service, we both pieced together a bunch of things about  our siblings and parents that made everything clear. It was like we both had half of a connect-the-dots puzzle that made no sense, and when put together the outcome was a big sign that said ""EVERYONE IN THIS FAMILY IS AWFUL.""

She confronted them about it after her contract ended and got kind of dragged into the drama all over again. She moved to a city near the hometown (about 1 hour away) and started working there right away. I cut everyone else out of my life. I hadn't spoken to most of them in years, and the others are cursory and obligatory in nature.

After my contract ended I started college using the GI Bill which not only paid for my tuition, but also paid a monthly housing stipend so I can focus on school. My family fucking HATED that I was basically getting free school to them. Couldn't explain that it meant giving up 4 years of my life for active duty and I have to drill every month in the reserves, and part of my body is permanently wrecked; to them it is an unfair advantage. While in school, I had a habit of buying a lottery ticket every month when the GI Bill hit my account. It was borderline superstitious as I never had any notion of winning because I remember a statistic once that said men in California have a higher chance at actually being Brad Pitt than winning the lottery.

My final semester I won. I didn't win Fuck-You money by any means. I won the type of money where you could pay cash for a 3 bedroom, 2 bath house with .36 acres in a county where housing prices were below the national average and then have nothing left. Yes it's specific because that's what I did. I never told any family, including my cool older sister because as much as I love her she would almost be obligated to tell the rest of them. The purchase of that home happened when I was 25, so 11 years ago. Since then I got married and had a kid and have an all around nice and pleasant life.

About a year ago, oldest sister was going to be near where I lived (several time zones away from family) for work and she wanted to visit me so she could meet my daughter and catch up. Against better judgment, I agreed because my wife wanted to know more about my family who she had never met.

So sister was staying with us for 3 days before she had to go do her work stuff and spent the whole time just reminiscing and catching up. At one point during dinner on the 2nd night she asked about what my mortgage must be like, since she paid $900 in rent for something much smaller and with no yard. My wife scoffed briefly, unaware that my family didn't know of my financial windfall.

Sister, though a troubled individual, is no dummy and picked up on that. Her tone shifted from casual to serious and asked ""What does that mean?""

I am not great at lying, improv, or doing anything without excess planning. I sat stupified while trying to figure out what to say before my wife said ""Well he used his winnings to just buy the house.""

Thus setting off the chain reaction of questions that culminated with sister finding out I made 6 digits for free while ""attending college for free"" and ""getting rent paid while not doing any fucking work."" She was absolutely livid and left for a hotel.

About 2 hours later the phone calls began from every member of my family accusing me of cutting them off so I wouldn't have to share this gift from god. The sister I got along with even got angry at me for keeping it a secret, but she understood that it would have put her in a bad position of lying to family. My phone, email, and wife's phone began blowing up for the next week while family tried to get money from me not understanding that there wasn't any left. They kept saying that they're about to file for bankruptcy because of debt and I could save the family but I'm just being selfish.

After a week, lawyers got involved because my family started threatening to sue me for damages for everything wrong in our family (they eventually did file). Every single thing that could even remotely justify going to small claims court or a full lawsuit was brought up. They even added up an estimated amount of gas money I borrowed since starting to drive at 16 with verbal agreements to ""pay you back later"" taking into account inflation and current gas prices. Everything together they asked for would have just been short of buying another house in cash.

I'm able to post this now because I was able to get about 90% of it dropped for being absolutely ridiculous, and showing that a lot of their claims occurred during a time when I had no contact with them (thank you phone and email records). The remaining 10% of what they wanted was stuff that happened when I was 17 or 18, like denting one of their cars or injuring them when I threw an empty beer bottle during a fight and leaving a permanent scar where the glass cut them.

After lawyer and court fees plus paying damages, I lost a bit more than $10k to family. The stress from the legal battle affected me at work and when it got out I was being sued by family after winning a lottery, all my coworkers began asking for help financially. It got bad enough (people coming to my home at night) that I had to request a transfer to a different branch where nobody knew me. Now I'm having to sell the home I bought, where my daughter was growing up in, and move to a more expensive city where the other branch is. All because I let my family back into my life

&#x200B;

TLDR: grew up poor, family sucked, joined military to escape poverty, found out family sucked even more than previously thought, went to college, basically won a house in the lottery, never told family, a decade later family found out, they sued me for every single thing they thought they could, I lost $10k due to fees, had to leave my job and move to a bigger city, all because my family sucks.

Happens to the best of us, eh? 😭 Now that the worst of the panic is over my husband and I are able to laugh about it but, God, that was awful. 

My husband and I generally don't have any trust issues. However, his ex girlfriend cheated on him several times so obviously some scars still carry over towards our marriage. 

We have a (4F) daughter and (1M) son, and we recently found out that I was pregnant. I found out first, I was feeling the nausea HARD and used a pregnancy test that I still had from the box from the last time I thought I was pregnant and, boom, baby in the oven. 

I found out on April 2nd and decided to wait until the 25th because that's my husband's birthday and thought it'd be the best birthday gift ever. Pregnancy brain kicked in fast, though, and I carelessly dropped the test in the trash under some toilet paper (I didn't what to touch my pee covered stick more than necessary) while forgetting my husband is the one who takes out the trash. 

Come next morning after the trash is taken out, my husband doesn't say anything so I think he didn't notice it. Come the 15th, we're grocery shopping when suddenly my husband starts crying and goes to the bathroom, I didn't want to drag the kids inside the men's bathroom so I call him on the phone and he, still crying, asks if it's his baby. 

This MAN- 

I'm not about to have this conversation inside of a Fry's so I manage to get him out of the bathroom, we go outside, I tell him my plan and give him a hug and apologize and he's laughing so hard he can't breath and then tells me to never do that again before he apologized for running to conclusions.

And then we went to get frozen yogurt. Food for the soul.

For my last 4semesters of uni i was shoplifting at a supermarket chain here in germany. I felt bad for doing so, thats why i always wrote up what i stole in my google keep app. last sunday i spent the whole day putting it all together in a huge excel file and thought to myself that, now that i have a good paying job (since august) - i can pay it back! i even stayed at the little apartment im in so i can put the money aside faster than if i had moved. so today i went to an atm and got the cash i needed to (only 971 euros, i was surprised how low the amount was) and went to the supermarket where i stole from with it. i told a woman who was putting stuff up the shelves' if i could see the manager, she asked why and i said i had shoplifted. she got me into this room and asked me to wait and that he'll be here. when he got here i told him about everything, with the printed out excel and the money. he told me that he didnt realise that it was me who was stealing it, they have caught some shoplifters but still saw the inventory not adding up. he was thankful and asked me to wait. i waited for like half an hour, kind of anxiously but also relieved. he came back with 2 policemen who repeated my story and asked me if it was true. i was a bit hesitent but the manager said that the conversation had been recorded. i said yes and basically they made me sign all these forms acknowledging what i did. now im looking towards jailtime and losing my job.

Background: I've been sick for a week or so with a wicked cough. I also have asthma, so it's rough. I'm going to the doctor later today, but in the meantime had to attend a Zoom meeting this morning.

I was in this Zoom meeting with about 15 other people when I unmuted to ask a question. I leaned back in my chair to really give off the beard-stroking academic vibe, and I heard a crack as some piece in my old AF Ikea desk chair exploded and the chair back went all the way backwards. And so did I.

Both of my cats, situated nicely under the computer monitors on my desk, did what cats do when there's an unexpected noise and completely lost their noodles. In classic kitty form, they destroyed everything in their path, knocking my mug off the desk and onto the floor, shattering it.

Meanwhile, I lay on the floor on my back having a huge coughing fit. I untangled myself from my chair and headphone wires and got up to go grab my inhaler. In the process, I stepped on some pieces from the shattered mug with my bare feet. I let out another round of cough-laden expletives as I walked away.

A few minutes later, I had my shit sorted out and came back to my desk and keeping with the theme of pandemic-related TIFU posts, I realized I had been unmuted the whole time and with my video on. Apparently my colleagues had just spent that time conjecturing on whether I had left my earthly body behind or what.

rzanxg,"TIFU by gag gifting my daughter
Found out today this humorous chain of events - well humorous depending on where you are in the chain.

I saw a month or so ago that someone bought a box of ferrero rocher chocolate and wrapped Brussel sprouts in the wrappers so I did this to my daughter. I unwrapped each piece and carefully wrapped a Brussel sprout in each wrapper and returned it to the box. Then I sent the gift and waited.

Christmas morning we talked and she thanked me for the candy. I asked her if she enjoyed them and she said yes - I knew she hadn't opened the gift yet, but why lie? I then realized that she probably re-gifted them. Then I asked again and she admitted that she had too much candy and wanted to get rid of some of it and her boss loves ferrero rocher. So I told her what I did.

She was amused but mad - mad at herself for regifting something I gave her as we are always doing stuff like that. It gets better.

She called her boss on Christmas day to tell her and her boss was like, ""Oh shit!"" She had re-gifted them to a client she was trying to keep after they'd had a heated exchange. The client is overweight and by the time my daughter's boss was able to call her it was too late. She wouldn't come to the phone. She was convinced that the wrapped vegetables was a slight and a message.

As far as I know she lost the client but isn't mad at my daughter.

EDIT: Glad this post amused so many people. Here are a few notes addressing the comments.

* It wasn't a giant box of candy, it was a 5 piece box. 
* I ate the candy as I wrapped the sprouts. No chocolate was harmed as a result of this prank.
* The candy was one of many gifts and stocking stuffers we brought over. It wasn't like a $200 box of chocolate was re-gifted. 
* I wrapped the sprouts on the 23rd and gave them to my daughter that afternoon. She took them as an afterthought to a party at her boss' house to add to a gift box she gave  to her boss.
* Her boss dropped them at the clients house on the 24th. 
* My family all agreed a few years ago to stop giving each other candy at holidays as we are all always trying to lose weight. 
* My opinion on regifting. It's actually a great thing if thought is applied. When it comes to gift giving I believe that it is the thought that counts. If I give a gift you can appreciate the thought and still share the gift with someone else. Whatever. To each is own. Thanks everyone :)

qavyv9,"TIFU by smelling my feet and ending up in the ER
This TIFU actually happened today! Or at least in the last 24 hours, either way I’m counting it. 

I’ll be the first to admit that my feet are sometimes a little bit smelly. Some of my friends and family have lovingly said they are “odorly challanged”. I wash them in the shower every day, I’ve tried the fancy creams, but none of it seems to really help and I’ve at this point accepted that I’m just naturally a stinkfoot and will live my life with a constant faint corn chip aroma wafting from my toes.

I live alone, and when in my apartment prefer not to wear socks or shoes. This is occasionally a point of contention with my girlfriend, who visits often and insists I at least wear socks when she comes over. Its mostly fun banter where she teases me for my feet smelling and I tease her for a loud burp or something like that, but sometimes after a particularly long day the foot factory releases emissions that would surely get me fined by EPA, which she rightfully hates. 

Yesterday she came over for dinner. It was a nice day so we decided to get delivery from one of our favorite restaurants and eat on the balcony. Well, I’m at home and I’ve already liberated my tootsies from their foot prisons, and I figured it’d be nice to set the table with some flowers for my lady. I was outside setting up when she arrived, and she came outside to greet me. IMMEDIATELY she smelled my feet and recoiled in disgust. The most dramatic reaction ever. Fake vomiting, fake crying, she was hamming it up as part of our banter. I HAVE gone a bit nose blind to them over the years, so I lean against the railing to balance and go to smell them myself to see how bad they were. This was my mistake. I’m a burly guy, and this poor railing could not handle my equally overdramatic reaction of throwing my head back and screaming. It gave way.

Luckily I’m only on the second floor, so I only fell maybe 25 feet, but it felt like it lasted a solid minute. It was at least long enough of a fall for me to reflect on the situation and feel like an idiot for dying from smelling my own feet. The aftermath is a fractured rib and dislocated shoulder, and my girlfriend never letting me live this down. 

TL;DR: smelled my feet, railing went yeet, almost died and I feel like sheet.

This was a few hours ago and I'm still embarrassed. I (26F) am a home health nurse and I work with a (17M) patient that is mentally challenged. He is very high functioning but has the mental capacity of about an 8 year old.
Anyway this patient is very fixated on the fact that I am pregnant. He asks me every time I'm with him if I've picked a name and when I'm having the baby. 
Today as soon as I walked in the door to his house he says ""I know you had sex"" I am a little shocked by this and don't say anything. He follows up by saying ""I know that how you got pregnant."" His mom is upstairs so I'm stuck navigating this by myself. (Important to the story) So here's where the FU comes. I said to him ""you're not wrong but sex isn't something you and I should talk about together. It's something you should ask your mom about."" I had completely forgot this kid has an extreme fear of doing anything wrong and took my comment as he shouldn't have said that to me. I thought the conversation was over and done with but then Him, His Mom, and me all get in the car to go to school. 
As soon as we are all stuck in the car together he very nervously yells "" THE NURSE AND I TALKED ABOUT HAVING SEX TOGETHER."" Now, as a nurse I've seen and hears many awkward things but this one takes the cake. I very awkwardly had to explain to his mom the situation and no, I did not talk about having sex with her mentally challenged son. She thought it was hilarious but I'm still mortified.

xr9hey,"TIFU by accidentally teaching my roommate's parrot to sing CBAT. My roommate doesn't know yet.
**Bird audio hyperlinked at the very end**

I am so dead. My roommate is out of town camping until the end of the weekend and he's going to kill me when he finds out.

Ok, so we all know the story with [CBAT](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/x35iu6/tifu_my_20f_girlfriend_of_two_years_told_me_the/), no need to go into that. My roommate is out of town for a week, and I have the whole apartment to myself. Four days ago, I (29m) asked my gf (29f) if she would like to enjoy some delicious fun time while blasting CBAT. Her and I are both super weird, and are open to doing this kind of dumb stuff. To no surprise, she laughed and said yes. I just thought it would be funny to experience. To my surprise, it really wasn't as weird as I thought it would be. It might be that the love I have for her is so powerful, that it left only about 5% of my brain power focusing on the dolphin sounds in the background.

The next day we decided to go at it again, only this time CBAT was a surprise for her. After a few minutes of kissing, I turned on the music and we both started laughing hysterically before getting it on. I even lasted longer than the day before, which I now regret.

Here's the problem which I stupidly did not even take a second to consider. While my roommate is out of town, I'm taking care of his parrot who dwells in our living room, which shares a very thin door with my bedroom. This is no ordinary parrot. This is a chattering lory (same bird as that red one on youtube who goes ""wuewuewue""). This bird does not shut up. He makes so much noise that I've naturally learned to ignore him after a year of living with it.

Anyway, somehow it never even crossed my mind that these parrots learn words and sounds and mimic them surprisingly accurately. Before leaving for work yesterday morning, I made some coffee and sat down in the living room for a bit just relaxing and closing my eyes. All of a sudden, I hear the first few notes of CBAT in perfect pitch and rhythm. I opened my eyes and this little dude is staring me dead in the face. 5-10 seconds pass, and I hear it again. I just grabbed my things and left for work immediately. I had to escape, figuring I'd just find a way to fix this or explain this later. But the more I think about it, the more I realize that I'm just dead. My roommate isn't weird like me and he hates when I say silly things to the bird. When he comes back this weekend, I'm worried he's gonna give a notice and leave.

Any advice on how to go about this would be greatly appreciated. I'm sweating as I'm writing this.

And no, for privacy reasons, I will not be posting a video of the bird.

TL;DR I tried intercourse with my gf twice while blasting CBAT just for the experience, and my roommate's parrot learned the song. My roommate doesn't know about this yet.

EDIT: When I get back home from work today, I will sit by the bird and record audio.

Two days ago I (19m) was hit up by a girl (19f) who was visiting my local area. She was only there for a week and I hadn't seen her since I was 7/8 so I agreed and thought it would be fun.

Yesterday we went on an early morning hike and I thought we had a lot of fun. She stayed at my house afterwards until she was pretty much forced to leave by me having to go to work. 

It is at this point that I should probably mention I had no feelings for her in any way. I just felt like we had a connection as friends. So i suggested we go with her friend to a bar together in the evening since she was leaving the next week and I thought it would be fun.

Red flag no. 1
I show up at the location and has specified and could not find her or her friend. Also there was a wedding happening at the venue she specified?
I tried calling and everything but she didn't answer. Eventually I managed to bump into her and two friends and they thoroughly convinced me that they were as confused about the wedding as I.

So we grouped up, started chatting and headed to a pub different from our original plan. 

Now I also want to mention that right from the start we talked about how we were going to split the bill. I was going to pay for my beer. The girls agreed to pay for the wine. One of the girls also ordered an expensive meal and said she would pay.

The music was great and the alcohol flowed. I'm not much of a drinker but I had a freaking amazing time. Nearing the end of our time there one of the girls suddenly got up and left. Now this is where I got confused, partially due to the alcohol and partially because I'm pretty trusting. The other two girls explained that they wanted to get a taxi with me back to their place to chill a bit longer before I would head home myself (again, there was no implication of sex or anything and I did not want any).

So yeah... They left me there telling me they were fetching this other friend back...

I'm a student so I have no money either. If I'd tried to pay for their two bottles of wine, my beer and the meal then my card would have declined.

Honestly the only things that kept me from rage was the excellent people at the restaurant who treated me with respect and allowed me to figure out how to pay. Also there was an incredible performing bassist there who offered to help me out until he saw the bill.

I didn't know people were that awful. I couldn't afford it and they knew that because we had talked about my job and how I need to save and pay for my own university tuition. 

The girl who I've known since I was tiny declined all calls and blocked me on WhatsApp. I'm so glad that my father is close with her family because I'm needing to get that money back (my father had to come and bail me out of the situation, bless him).

EDIT: As this is gaining a bit more traction I do want to mention that my gf called me and helped me through the situation. I am so grateful for her and will relay any messages from the comments to her :)

Obligatory this didn’t happen today, but about 8 or so years ago.

My sophomore year of high school I was dating a girl I met on the swim team. She and I seemed to hit it off pretty quick and all was good. I was over at her place one day and we were watching a movie together. Her grandfather that she lived with at the time came in to let us know he was running to the store and would be back in about 45 minutes. Around that same time, her sister let us know she was leaving to go hang out with her boyfriend, leaving the two of us utterly alone. We’re sitting there just watching the movie when she says she’s a little warm and takes her shirt off, so she’s just there in her sweatpants and bra. I’m a virgin at this rate so I’m trying to pretend that that didn’t give me the world’s fastest boner and act like it’s totally nothing. She then decides her sweatpants are a little warm and takes those off too, all the while, I’m pretending to not notice. 

Now I’ll be honest here, I legit had no clue what was going on. I was raised to be very very respectful and never assume women are hinting at something, because after all, it was a little warm in there. We’re cuddled up on this sofa, her half naked, when she gets up, walks over to her drawer, and whips out a condom. She walks over to me and goes “Soooo, I have a condom.” to which I reply “Oh, cool. Why?” And she says “Well, you never know when you’re going to need one.” then I say “Oh fair point. Well keep an eye on it! Those things expire, you know!” She paused for a few moments, then said “I don’t think I’ll have it long enough to expire.” and I go “That’s the spirit!”. She just stares at me, dumbfounded, and I stare back, still painfully unaware of what’s going on. She puts it back, throws her clothes back on and we finish the movie. She broke up with me about a week later….

TL;DR: half naked girlfriend told me about her condom and I told her to keep an eye on it in case it expires.

EDIT: Some people are saying this is fake because no one can possibly be this oblivious, and honestly, I can’t blame you. That being said, this really is a 100% true story.

So, we've got **hundreds** of feral/stray cats living in the woods behind my house. When I can, I TNR (trap, neuter, release) them. The local place will give them their shots, spay/neuter them, and then ""ear tip"" them to mark them as fixed, all for $27, pretty great deal. 

So, at about 2am (~2 hours ago as I type this), I was woken by a horny cat howling outside my window. I chase it off with a can of pennies. I fall back to sleep, and 15 minutes later, it wakes me up again. So I yell out my window to the cat ""If you don't shut your whore mouth right this instant I will **lock you in a cage**!"" (referring to the traps I use). The cat runs off, and I get back to sleep. 

Well, about half an hour ago, I had 4 cop cars in my driveway and a few angry State Troopers pounding on my door. I explain what happened, they interview all 6 people in the house, and then they leave, satisfied that I was not a domestic abuser who locks her wife in a cage at night.

I have a pretty high spice tolerance and frequently eat the Korean fire noodles, sometimes with extra Korean chili flakes added to make it super spicy. I had a bowl today, before inviting a guy I've been casually seeing.

He comes over and we get all excited. He loves oral, so I start sucking, and he's moaning, so I'm thinking he's into it, right? Well, his moaning gets louder and he starts pushing on my head, so I assume that means keep going, and go harder. So I do that.

Finally, he yells ""FUCK!"" And pushes me away. He starts screaming at me that his dick is burning and what the fuck did I do to it? I was really confused, while he went to the bathroom to go see what was going on. And my eyes see the opened ramen pack in the kitchen trash bin, and I realize the spice/pepper must've still been in my mouth and probably burned him.

He comes out cursing, asking me what the fuck was wrong with me. I apologized and explained I didn't realize my eating ramen could hurt him. He left, and I'm a little disappointed. But also now I'm hungry again and eating another bowl of Korean fire noodles with extra chili flakes

TL;DR: burned a guy's dick after eating Korean fire noodles

uz2n3r,"TIFU: by thinking peanut butter was supposed to be spicy
Obligatory: this happened a few months back.

Ever since I was a kid I loved how peanut butter used to taste. Not only did it taste good, but it had this weird ""spice,"" to it that wasn't like a chili pepper type spice, but wholly unique that I never tasted in other foods. It was the perfect accent when mixed with jelly, as the spiciness and the sweetness went together perfectly. Sometimes I'd ""eat too fast,"" and have a bit of a hard time breathing, but I never thought anything of it. I also remember getting some weird looks a few times as a kid talking about spicy peanut butter, but didn't think anything of that either.

One day a few months ago, I (25m) was staying at my parents house and went to make myself some lunch. I saw some peanut butter in the pantry, but no jelly so since I was hungry I slammed about an inch of peanut butter between two slices of bread and remember thinking ""wow, this is the most peanut butter I've ever eaten at once,"" but then got to work devouring my creation.

This is where the fuckup starts. A few bites in I got that ""ate too fast,"" feeling again and had to take a break to catch my breath. I started eating again and immediately got the ate-too-fast feeling again. *Damn, it's going to take me forever to eat this sandwich* I thought, so I became determined to just power through and finish it no matter how uncomfortable it was. Big Mistake.

I made it to about the half way point before I knew something was wrong. It felt simultaneously like there was a rock stuck in my windpipe and like somebody had filled my lungs with peanut butter. Weezing and struggling to breath, it fucking *hurt*. The amount of time it took to take a full breath was causing me to panic and felt like I was trying to fill up a hot air balloon with a straw. I immediately started googling ""heart attack symptoms,"" but they didn't really match up. I then googled the symptoms themselves and results of ""symptoms of allergic reactions,"" started coming up. Some of the main symptoms were difficulty breathing, chest tightness, and wheezing. Then I scrolled further down and saw a section about ""things to watch out for in children,"" and the top one was... the child says their ""mouth feels hot,"" or that they say non-spicy food is spicy.

After a painfully long period of time I started being able to breath again and suddenly all the weird looks I got from talking about spicy peanut butter made sense! Peanut butter wasn't spicy, I'd just been poisoning myself all these years! I now use peanut butter alternatives and mix my jelly with ""sweet Asian chili jelly,"" I pick up from the store and it's just as good, but doesn't almost kill me.

TLDR: I thought peanut butter was supposed to taste spicy, turns out I'm just an idiot and allergic to it.

EDIT: Thanks for the awards! Also glad I could help some people realize the signs of allergies. 

EDIT 2: A lot of people were asking why I didn't immediately call an ambulance. Remember, this was something that happened all the time and I thought was normal, so it took about 30 seconds of me waiting for it to go away, then realizing it wasn't and drinking some water (40-120 seconds now), before I even went to get my phone. By this point it had actually started to get better (slowly, but noticeably) so I knew I was in the clear. This is why I googled 'heart attack,"" as it was my understanding that some of those symptoms can be transient.",tifu,2008
s0slrj,"TIFU by saving my neighbors life
For starters this literally just happened ten minutes ago, and be ready to buckle up because boy is this one long.

So, my fianceé (F29) and I (M30) have lived in our current apartment for 8 months and have had a pretty decent experience overall. It would be perfect if it wasn't for the neighbors that moved in about four months ago. Just to set the stage for what we have been going through, these neighbors throw parties that start at 4:00 am and end at 2:00 pm all the time and when they aren't having their parties they are just blaring music loud enough to make Hellen Keller ask them to STFU all day long. Both my fiancé and I work from home, so this can get incredibly annoying, but nevertheless we solider on. 

Which brings us to today. Today I noticed from my office that there is a persistent beeping. After about five minutes I go to the living room and ask my fiancé if that was our neighbors smoke detector. She said that she thinks so, so I went to investigate.

I go out in the hall and notice that the sound is coming from their apartment, but I don't smell any smoke and the door is cold to the touch. So I figure they have it under control and go back to my apartment to continue working. About twenty minutes later I notice it is still going off (and by this point my dog is freaking the fuck out) so I go back to the hallway, smell smoke, and courageously bang on the door. No answer. I continue banging on the door but no one is responding.

So I do the only logical thing and call maintenance. I give maintenance man (henceforth MM) the run down on the days events and he says he'll be right over. Problem solved right? Wrong! Because this dear listeners is when the story gets fun.

MM arrives, goes to the neighbors apartment, and does his maintenance thing. When no one answers he goes in and the horrid smoke detector finally stops. I am just about set to go back to my work when all of a sudden there is a knock on my door. 

I open it to find MM standing there on the phone telling another member of maintenance to get the police and ambulance on their way over because he thinks ""the kid next door is dead"". MM then looks at me and says ""I need you to come in here with me incase he is faking and attacks.""

Now, I have been in some fights in my youth but I am in no means someone who is prepared to duke it out with anyone holding any kind of weapon. Not to mention the fact that MM has a good 2 feet and 120 lbs. on me so if he goes down I'm all but fucked. So naturally I do the responsible thing and agree to go with MM.

We enter an apartment FILLED with smoke and I see a burnt pot on a stove covered in the foam from a fire extinguisher. Apparently a fire had started and MM put it out and opened all the windows to try to get rid of the smoke.

And, sure enough, passed out on the floor, is one of my fucking neighbors (henceforth Fire Starter a kid I am assuming is around 23). MM proceeds to shake and nudge Fire Starter in an attempt to get a response. But this kid ain't moving folks. We're in there for at least five minutes trying to get this kid up, so eventually MM tells whoever he is on the phone with to ""get the ambulance and police over here now"".

Apparently, ""police"" was the magic word because Fire Start wakes the fuck up and goes agro on MM. MM takes it like a champ and proceeds to tell Fire Starter he is a dumbass and almost burning down a building is not okay. Fire Starter just keeps yelling for MM to get the fuck out (I had beyond backed out into the hall at this point). MM keeps his cool and just keeps saying ""man we just saved your life show some goddamn respect"".

Fire Starter then asks for MM's name so he can report him, which MM gave, then asked for my name so he can report me for trespassing. MM refused to give my name saying ""he's the only reason you're alive right now you useless shit"". To which Fire Starter grabs a kitchen knife and starts waiving it at MM. MM keeps his cool, collects his keys, and walks off all while Fire Starter chases him down the stairs being an incoherent little shit. In the meantime I have predictably retreated to my own apartment only to have Fire Starter standing outside my door screaming ""I know where you live you piece of shit"".

Good times.

TL;DR Dumb ass young violent neighbor passed out and caught his stove on fire, I called maintenance thereby saving his life, and now I am looking for a new place to live.

Update: Just got done giving my statement to the police. Thank you to everyone who was asking for updates. It’s for sure a fucked up tale that is far from over. I’ll provide updates as I hear things.

Update 2: There has been a cop outside the apartment building all morning. Haven’t heard anything from inside today though. 

Update 3: Haven’t updated for a while because I was waiting on confirmation but Fire Starter was evicted. We noticed someone moving out about a week later but didn’t see who it was and yesterday noticed another couple moving in. Haven’t met them yet but I also haven’t heard a peep from their apartment even with them unloading. So they are already better than our last neighbor.

Acknowledgement: Yes we should have called the fire department first. We didn’t because this is not the first time their smoke detector has just gone off. Usually they let it beep the whole time they cook, but it has never gone off that long before.",tifu,1321

I (23M) was talking to this girl (23F) for a week on Tinder and Instagram. She was gorgeous and she seemed very fun and outgoing but she did have a investment girl boss vibe to her (and that's ok but I should've seen it coming). 

I asked her for a coffee date and she says yes, we meet up and she looks good but not exactly like her photos, no problem there let's see if we connect I thought.

The first 10mins goes great, conversation is flowing and I ask her if she wants some coffee (after all we're at a coffee shop on a coffee date), she says no, because she had some earlier (first red flag, I mean who goes on a coffee date but drinks some just before the actual date?)

A tells me to go and get one for myself if I want. Alright no problem, I go and get my coffee and when I come back, there's another girl at our table. 

She says, hey this is my partner (we'll call her B), I was working with her earlier. That's when it hit me that this wasn't a date lol.

B starts asking me questions about my job, my studies and asks me If I would listen to their business plan so that I could make more money each month (lmao).

So she takes out a notepad and starts explaining me their business model and how much money I would make If I would find 3 other persons who would find 3 other people themselves, etc. 

I straight up tell her : ""So this is like a pyramid scheme right? This ain't no date?"" To which A responds : ""Oh it is a date but you seemed like a cool person to become our partner (lmao what) and this isn't a pyramid scheme, it's multi-level-marketing (MLM)"". Okay so exactly the same thing. I couldn't believe that this was happening to me.

Oh boy, so I sat there for legit 15 more mins and listened to them explain to me how I could make up to 5k a month if I were to get 100 people to join this business.

I told them I had to leave to go to the vet with my dog. They didn't seem happy that I wasn't interested in their MLM lmao. I laughed so much on the way home that I was crying. 

TLDR : Went on a coffee date with a gorgeous girl from Tinder and when I went to get my coffee she texted her business partner to come and pitch me their pyramid scheme business model for 30mins.

Edit 1 : Thank you so much for the awards, upvotes and comments! I did report A's profile on Tinder as spam as soon as I got home. The product they were trying to sell were some vitamins, proteins, Omega-3 tablets and some ""very good collagen"" lol.",tifu,1177

stauw5,"TIFU by surprising my man with something for Valentine’s day
Me (F24) and my boyfriend (M26) have a pretty Vanilla sex life. He likes to do the regular stuff he’s used to but I want to switch it up sometimes. Sometimes he does but it’s like he’s not really into it so we just do the regular stuff. 

For a couples weeks now i’ve been setting up a threesome with me and my friend for him. She was down with it and she’s leaving this city so we won’t see her anymore and we could just forget about the whole thing (so i thought). 

Valentine’s day comes and he’s surprising me the whole day with flowers, gifts, food, clothes, yada yada. The last thing he had planned for us was dinner and it was amazing. We’re heading back home and i’m texting my friend making sure she set everything up and she’s ready for us to come in. 

We get home, go in and the room is set up so nice. Rose petals, Hennessy (I think that’s where i messed up) and tree. We played a drinking game and smoked and then we were getting into it. everything was good at first but then they started getting like TOO into each other. 

He’s flipping her over and doing tricks and putting his leg up and moaning and grunting while i’m getting the bare minimum. She’s over there moaning and going crazy acting like it’s the best dick she ever had in her life. the whole situation just made me uncomfortable so i ended up saying i was tired and we went to bed. 

I woke up this morning to cook for all of us and they were still just acting too friendly. laughing and touching and all that. she left a couple hours ago but he’s glued to that phone now. He won’t even let me see what he’s doing on it either. fuck my life. 

TL;dr: don’t have a threesome with your man he might just like the girl you brought more than you.

edit: I’m not mad about my boyfriend enjoying the threesome. I did it for him! I was just mad because he was ignoring me basically the whole threesome then was ignoring me and texting HER. I posted this on TIFU because I know this is on me. never asked for advice🤷🏽.

update: We talked about it and I just told him how i just didn’t expect the night to go like that, i got jealous, and I felt like he wasn’t showing me enough attention. He told me he just “got excited” because he knew it was a one time thing, hes sorry and maybe threesomes aren’t for us lmfao. I showed him that nobodies better than the original -*joseline voice*- and as far as the texting, he said he’s not texting her so i’m just going to trust him and forgot about that.

edit 2: IM BISEXUAL! I like girls and my boyfriend is the first man i ever dated. It was definitely supposed to be a threesome, not 2 straight girls and 1 straight guy. they just excluded me. tbh i think she’s not as gay as she says but that’s on me.",tifu,2155

This happened a few years ago, it was my first week of university studying law. I met a young guy a few years younger than me let's call him Dave, in my class who I spent most of the first week with.

It was our first ever criminology class and it was a new lecturer a woman in her mid 20s and the lesson was in a auditorium of nearly 100 people. She began by explaining the difference between manslaughter and murder and begin to tell us of a real case example.

The lecturer who ended up quite red in the face explained about a couple engaging in some form of roleplay and eventually ended with him fisting his partner. A signet ring he was wearing caught inside her and she unfortunately ended up bleeding to death.

Now comes the fuck up, obviously after this story there was a very awkward silence. Dave thought this break in noise was the perfect time to ask me a pertaining question in his innocence. 'I get why that would be considered manslaughter but why does she keep saying fisting instead of punching?'

The question was so hilariously innocent at the worst ever time. I'm now sitting cry-laughing unbelievably loudly after this absolute horrible story. It was 100 times funnier like a joke at a funeral because I knew how surreal it must be for everyone else in attendance of me laughing so hard I can barely breathe.

t6ajrr,"TIFU I thought all dudes observed the clean butt etiquette when they get BJs
I see a guy in my building to give him the occasional BJ when he’s in the mood but the women he’s casually dating are all unavailable. It’s all fun and games. Nothing serious. I go over, get on my knees, we both leave happy. 

So today while giving him a very sloppy service, he decided to straddle my face and make me lick his ass. I mean, I have done it once or twice. It’s not my first choice or second choice on the menu. But he seemed like he really wanted it, and I thought doing it would distract him from wanting to anal me, as he had stealthily moved from squeezing my butt cheeks to fingering my butt during BJ. I was not ready for anal.

So I let him squat over my face and plant his butt crack squarely on my face. I assumed all guys observed the clean butt etiquette when they get BJs. The BJ to ball licking to taint licking to butt licking transition happens enough that I assumed every guy cleans the entire pelvic region before a BJ session. 

I assumed incorrectly. I screamed into his ass canyon but my screams were muffled. I got out from under him so fast. I didn’t want to look at him. I didn’t want to talk about it. I saw his tightie whitie on the floor as I left, looking down to avoid any eye contact, and noticed the skid marks. The sight of it made me puke a little acid bile in my mouth. 

To top it off, on my way back to my unit, I had to wear a mask in the elevator, which only amplified the scent of his unclean ass. It was a no for me. 0/10. Do not recommend. 

TL;DR: I assumed all men observed the clean ass etiquette when they make their partners lick their butts. I was wrong.

Update 1: I just can’t stand awkwardness and I was pretty rude the way I ran out. I messaged him to apologize and clarified it was a hygiene issue, which he claimed he wasn’t aware of (how?). Anyway, I told him it wasn’t my favorite on the menu, but willing to do it if he cleaned thoroughly. Turns out he wanted to eat me out mostly, but thought he could only do it if he let me do it first. I clarified for him that he can feel free to dine out on my butthole and finger me all he wants. I don’t feel the need or desire to reciprocate. Just no anal yet. Communication and friendship re-established.

tiamrc,"TIFU: Gave my friend a boner
So I (F) have a friend called Scott (M). He’s generally very comfortable with me and  the physical contact in our relationships pretty adequate. 

Now this happened about 2 weeks ago. I was with him and a bunch of friends at some gig. It was late night and we both had smoked a couple joints before hitting the road. So we’re at the back of  the car wondering how we’ll fit six people in the back. We decide I will sit on top of my other friend Jade. We’re pretty far away from home and the area we’re driving through is a bit sketchy. Also the roads haven’t been done up in years so it’s a pretty long drive (45 mins on average). 

I’m sitting ontop of Jade and her legs were starting to hurt so I move onto my other friend and finally Scott. We have 30 mins of our ride left and I’m sort of on the edge of Scott’s knee, so i scoot backwards. Now my ass is kinda on his thigh but nothing crazy. As the road gets bumpier I keep getting tossed around, so I lean back trying to press into the window but there isn’t enough room for me to make the adjustment and I end up right on top of Scott’s dick. I try not to make eye contact and adjust forward but this on top of the bumps in the road make it sort of like a bouncing/grinding motion. Scott asks me to get up for a second so he can adjust his lap but that only makes it worse.

We sit like this in silence for 10 mins. 

And oh my god.

I felt it grow...

Now I don’t know if Scott knew I knew he had a semi but he out of the blue asks if he can place his hand anywhere since it’s getting uncomfortable and ends up placing it on my thigh. 

Oh cherry on top. We’re both soaked from the rain. I mean dripping wet. 

Now my back is pressed into his chest and I can feel his breathing a bit more intensely but I hold back a comment. And then the throbbing starts. I can feel Scott’s dick literally throbbing below me. 

He starts shaking his leg and clenching his thigh but I don’t know what that would do considering I am literally on top of him and it’s only making me bounce up and down on it. 

Another 20 mins of sitting like this.

Finally we pull up to our friends house and when we finally get off the first thing I see is him adjust his pants before walking hurriedly inside.

umcxoi,"TIFU by trying polyamory
A few weeks ago, me (27F) and my partner (27M) broached the topic of potentially dating other people also. We do the entire negotiation of the boundaries, rules for making things work, hard limits on what is okay, etc. Great! I am more interested in adding another partner to our relationship, but my partner wanted to try dating separately first, just to see. I’m a reasonable girl, so I’m game to try it, and after a few weeks of attempts we set up our dates for the same day (today). I chose friendly acquaintance guy from another department at work and he chose hot rando girl from Tinder. We excitedly wish one another luck and head off on our respective dates!

 My date (who we will call Mark) and I meet up at a cute seafood restaurant for dinner together. Things start off rocky. It becomes immediately clear that Mark has never been within 6 feet of a human woman. I am doing all of the talking, and he is staring at me intently and nodding his head in silence. I eventually run out of things to say because he isn’t participating and start desperately looking at my phone, texting and browsing Reddit, to avoid the unbearable awkwardness. Eventually Mark takes some initiative and participates in conversation, and is actually telling me about himself. Whew, maybe he isn’t actually a serial killer and is just a little nervous! 

After some really fun and invigorating conversation, Mark then decides to drop all of his bombshells on me at random and with no warning! He lets me know that he lives with his parents, has a small penis, and enjoys playing with dolls. Okaaaay. I did not ask for this information lol. I reassure him that these things are fine (probably?) and kind of laugh it off as a weird joke that fell flat . At this point, I am ready to flee, but Mark mentions the movie I had planned for us at my house after dinner. I begrudgingly accept because I am a huge pushover, and I am still holding out hope that Mark will surprise me and completely change back into the normal guy that I know from work. 

Obviously you all know this didn’t happen. As we are watching the movie, Mark tries to pull a move on me. And by pull a move, I mean startle me by basically jumping off of the couch and ripping his pants down. I panic, because 1. There has not been any indication I am interested in having sex with him at all and 2. His penis was actually so small that there was no way I could have sex with him even if I wanted to. I am not one to body shame at all, and I have never cared about a partner’s size, but I just don’t see how it would be possible. 

So my body just does what it normally does when I get into a state of panic: immediately vomit. Just right onto the floor. We are both frozen, staring at the vomit-y carpet. I look him directly in the eyes and quietly tell him that I don’t think dinner agreed with me, and that he should probably leave. He does. 

My partner returns home a little later and said his date was also a bust. His lovely lady pulled out a baggie of cocaine on the drive home and proceeds to turn on all of the interior lights in his car, so that she can scoop up a spoonful using her special coke spoon that was apparently decoratively attached to her wallet? I am just in shock, dating is tough, I’m not thinking we will be trying this again for quite some time. Godspeed to my single people out there.

TL;DR Me and my partner tried dating other people. My date probably went home thinking his dick was so horrifying it made me vomit. Partner’s date did blow in his car. Never again. Maybe.

EDIT: Did not really expect so many to be interested in me anxiety-barfing in the direction of my date. Mark, if you are out there reading this, no hard feelings. I think you were just really nervous and awkward. I hope you know that my getting sick had very little to do with your penis size and everything to do with that being unprovoked and shocking. Someone will care about and appreciate you just the way you are. Please be careful about asking people for consent before you try things with a new partner, and when someone says they will not have sex with you and it’s just a date, they mean it. Let’s uh….never speak of this ever and go back to being regular work acquaintances.

EDIT 2?: I’m not sure if you’re supposed to edit a lot or not lol. But getting a lot of the same questions, so figured I would try to answer! Yes, literally every single person involved was informed about all of the other people, and specifically told that this would be a date only and sex was not a possibility. Hence the confusion and panic. No, did not throw up from seeing a weird dick. Have anxiety. I have thrown up in a grocery store, I have had to leave people hanging that I was interviewing to throw up, this has happened at least once at every job I’ve worked at. This is the least weird part of the story, for me anyways. No, I don’t think my partner is going to leave me. No, I do not want to leave my partner. No, I do not want to go on a date with any of the random internet people in my messages, did you learn nothing from this?! Me and my partner have had a great laugh over this, thank you everyone for making this into something fun instead of something terrible. I hope everyone out there has the same luck in finding their perfect match(es) out there! 💕",tifu,2065

As the title suggests I borrowed my wife's laptop for a presentation because it had a full size hdmi port and my chromebook does not, and lets face it the pink case brings out my eyes. I open it up and chrome is open on reddit with her signed in. I know IATA here but I was curious and honestly hoping to find some nudes that we could use later to try and spice things up(idiot). 

A little backstory. I am an individual with serious mental health challenges and lately my depression has gotten the better of me and was sucking the life out of my wife. She has told me as much. I never thought I would be winning husband of the year awards but I genuinely love my wife and would do anything for her. I'm probably letting myself of too easy. Anyways in December my wife tells me that she can't handle it anymore and I need to get my stuff together or we're done. I have given every effort possible since then, multiple counselling sessions a week, changes in medicine, changes in careers and feel like I've made solid progress.

Back to my fuckup, I see her profile and notice the most recent post was really highly liked (3k+) and even given an award, Cool! Then I read it. I won't go into specifics because some degenerate will track the post down but needless to say it paints me very negatively. She describes me with very harsh language and this was all brought on by a fight we had that I will admit was not my finest moment. I get upset after reading the first couple of lines and give up, close out of the browser and prepped for my presentation. Later that night my wife notices that I'm upset and asks me what is wrong. I try to avoid the confrontation because we had been doing so well but she persists and I brake down. I tell her that I saw her post and that I was sorry, I had no right to look at her account. I told her I wasn't angry at her for making the post but it did really hurt and killed any self-confidence I had left. In a credit to our couples therapy we talked it out like adults and she even read me the post in full and said that was it. We make up and all is well not good but atleast ok.

As I'm laying in there in bed something is nagging at me. Something about the way she kept saying that was it made me feel like she was hiding something and lying to me. So I get up and go to the living room and Fuck up again by looking her post up and finding her account. I read for hours, she only had one other post about me but it was fairly generic deadbeat husbands asks me to make breakfast on my morning off(I'm working on not doing shit like that now sorry honey). Then I look at her comments. I get why she lied and said the one post was it, she was protecting my feelings. She hates me. She doesn't think counselling will work. She's just biding her time to kick me out. I am an awful human being with no redeeming qualities. She doesn't enjoy our sex life and feels like it ranges from a forced chore to pathetic and boring.

I plan to talk to her about it. I know I am the asshole in this for reading her shit. This is the love of my life and mother of my children. I have destroyed everything good in my life. Its over. I have no chance to save it.

vybvjv,"TIFU Asking my Tinder date to choke me.
(This Happened a few weeks back, only posting now since the condition has finally cleared up.)


I've just recently started getting back into the dating scene. Met up with a guy from tinder that I'd been chatting with for a few days for drinks. Things were going very well, there were no awkward gaps in conversation, we were both into alot the same things, he was really funny, and it didn't hurt that he was also super fucking hot and in shape.


Maybe 2ish hours in he asked me if I had any plans afterwards. When I told him I was probably just gonna go home and watch Kenobi, he asked if I ""wanted someone company"" while I did. I said fuck yeah and we headed back to my place, where needless to say we did not end up watching Kenobi, or at least not very much if it before we dropped the pretense, started mashing lips together, and clothes started flying off.


Something to note about me is that I love roughness and love getting manhandled. I understand that's not for everyone, but that's what I like. This guy was very sweet, and very gentle with me, but at this point I'm very much into it and trying to get him to go harder. Spank me, pull my hair, etc. Finally he's got me prone from behind and I'm calling out for him to choke me, since I know it'll drive me over the edge. He's very reluctant, but eventually relents.


I had expected him to just use one hand on my neck, but he ended up using his whole arm, kind of like how they do in ufc fights. It was very tight, but he was putting almost no pressure on it, so I could still breathe relatively normally. I'm not sure if that makes sense, but it's the best way I can think to describe it. Wanting it to be tighter I kind of teased him by saying ""C'mon don't be a pussy"" trying to be sexy but also letting him know to choke me harder. He obliged, and it was the tightest I've ever been choked. I could feel my whole body shaking as I started to orgasm, the next thing I knew I was jolting awake and gasping for air.


It's not the first time I've passed out from being choked, but this guy was urgently trying to get me dressed and to a hospital. I thought he was overreacting until he got me in front of a mirror and I saw that one of my eyes was filled with blood. Like imagine all the parts of your eye that are white are all just blood red. It didn't hurt, but needless to say it freaked me out pretty badly.


To wrap up this overly long story, I spent about 4-5 hours awkwardly explaining what happened to multiple nurses and hospital staff, explaining that I had asked him to do it and that he wasn't abusing me. Which I imagine was hard to believe given the appearance of my eye and the bruise starting to form around my neck. Long story short, the doctor let me know I had popped a blood vessel in my eye, and that while it looked bad, it was most likely superficial and would clear up in a few weeks.


He ended up driving me home, but ended up not responding to any of my calls or texts the following day. Found out he ended up unmatching me on tinder as well. So yeah, pretty sure I traumatized him and blew that opportunity at a relationship.


TL;DR: Ended up asking my tinder date to choke me, ended up passing out and popping a blood vessel in my eye, had to explain that I'm just a kinky weirdo to hospital staff, and likely traumatized my date to the point he wants nothing to do with me.

Edit: Just wanted to take a moment to update this post and clear up some things. 

1. I completely acknowledge that this situation was 100% my fault and I really do feel awful about what happened, but there's not a whole lot I can do.

2. I had already reached out to try to make amends the day after the incident happened. As much as I would love to properly apologize in person for everything that happened, it's clear that he dosen't want to speak to me, so I'm going to respect his wishes on that.

3. No, I'm not ""going to therapy"" because I have a kink and got caught up in the moment because I was horny, or for any other contrived reason you come up with .

4. Please stop assuming I'm super into BDSM I'm really not. I just enjoy a little roughness and bring choked. I do appreciate the people giving solid advice though.

5. He might have been reluctant to choke me, but he was still very much a willing participant. You can call it victim blaming or whatever, but some of you are very cavalier with your use of the word rape and sexual assault.

vncutx,"TIFU by buying a life size sex doll
Obligatory, I bought it 3 days ago… but I just got it today. 

So… I have considered getting a doll before because ya know… it’s tits and ass on demand. I justified it by saying it’ll save me time from having to go out and get girls IRL blah blah. And also I kinda thought it’d provide some company while I’m home alone lol. 

I was looking at these $3,000 dolls and almost made the purchase but found a cheaper one for just around $1k. I couldn’t justify spending $3k knowing that there would be a high chance I’d regret it.

It came in a big box, I hauled it into my bedroom, it ways about 30kg.. I underestimated just how much that weighs. So I sliced open the box and started removing the packaging and I could see it’s little fucking toes poking out and I was like… oh shit… here we go. Kept removing the packaging and of course I grabbed the tits as soon as I saw them. They’re okay, but nothing like the real thing ofc. 

I pulled the cold corpse of a doll out of its box… it didn’t have its head screwed on.. so I unwrapped the head, plonked that on.. and it’s a half decent looking thing. Better than I was expecting tbh. I wasted no time sticking the electric warming stick up it’s pussy, waited a few minutes, dumped it on the bed and.. well, we had a play. 

Ngl… it’s better than a hand or pocket pussy but believe me, once you “finish”… you now have to wrestle it’s cold body, clean what needs to be cleaned (in this case I unscrewed it’s head and basically force fed it water in the sink lol). I hadn’t yet thought… where tf do I store this thing. It’s about 160cm tall… so I plonked it in my closet on a cabinet wrapped it in a blanket and Jesus Christ.. it looks like a corpse.. literally. I now have to walk in there every day to be greeted by a cold wrapped up corpse when I need to grab some clothes. The heck do I do with it, it’s corpse or bye bye $1k. 

tl;dr: If you aren’t actually THAT lonely and only getting a sex doll “out of curiosity”, there is a very big chance you’ll regret it.",tifu,2133
ttl7h7,"TIFU by removing my girlfriend's tattoos in photoshop and realising I'm not as attracted to her as I thought and now I'm terrified for the future
TL:DR at the bottom.

Enjoy my fuck-up story, oddly enough for this sub, it did happen yesterday. Sorry for any mistakes, I'm not a native speaker.

&#x200B;

Me and my girlfriend exchange nudes frequently. They never leave our phones/computers and we trust each other on that. I like to mess around in photoshop as a hobby and often times I use my gf's nudes for practice. Change the lighting, remove/add things in the background, sometimes I edit her into a playboy cover for a laugh. A few days ago I bought a new laptop, as my old one died some time ago. I installed photoshop on it yesterday and wanted to mess around with it. I found some tutorials online about photoshop tattoo removal and decided to give it a try. Seeing as I had no work the next day, I also decided to get high. I gathered some pics of my girlfriend and went to work. 

My girlfriend has a big tattoo on her upper chest (covering her collar bones and the upper part of her boobs), two smaller pieces on her hips, one between her shoulder blades and some smaller ones on her legs and arms. When we met she already had all the major ones and she did two more while with me. It has never bothered me, I thought her tattoos are cool. But before falling for her I never imagined myself to be with such a heavly tattooed girl but I hadn't really thought about it since then.

Now, I edited the pictures, starting from the smaller tattoos and evencually getting rid of the big chest one. I followed a tutorial and made a damn good job in my opinion. I ended up doing three pics and when I was admiring my work I got very... Well, I got hornier then I ever had in my life. 

I've always considered my gf's body to be a 10/10. That combined with her wonderful personality made me fall in love quick and hard, and I didn't even think to wonder how she would look like if she didn't have the tattoos. Well now I know. And to me she would look infinitly better.

I regret using photoshop a lot last night. She obviously can't get rid of the tattoos. Not only would it be horribly expensive, but also she really loves them. Also I don't think it's my place to even ask that. She's also a tattoo artist and scheduled to have a ""half a body"" tattoo done in two or so months by another artist who she's a great fan of. I won't ask her to skip the tattoo. She's very excited about it and has been saving up for a long time. I was never particularly happy that she was getting it, but I was just glad she was excited and again, it's her choice what she puts on her body.

Now I realise just I don't like tattoos on her. I thought a lot last night and realised the signs were there, but for some reason it has never occured to me. For example when we chatted about her tattoo plans I asked her not to tattoo her tummy too soon because I like how soft it lookes on it's own. She would say in that a few years I will have a wife covered from head to toe in ink and I always laughed it off because I didn't want to think about it. I also had a shameful realisation that I've been enjoying sex a lot more since we started to do it doggy style. The one tattoo on her back usually get's covered by her hair so you can't see any tattoos. 

I'm kinda freaking out. As I mentioned, my ""favourite parts"" of her  body are the ones with no tattoes on them, that being the back and her waist. The tattoo she's getting is going to go from her arm, down her side and down the leg. Which means it will be pretty much impossible to not see. I'm really ashamed to say I'm afraid I won't be as attracted to her when she does it. I'm afraid to even bring it up because she has horrible body image issues and I'm scared she would be really effected if I said I'm worried about her getting the tattoo. I also know with the way things are going (her becoming a tattoo artist and such) she is going to get more. 

I deleted the pictures this morning. They give an ultra boner but the worst moral hangover ever.

&#x200B;

TL:DR

s5ajen,"TIFU by watching futanari porn and getting caught by my father.
So, I was looking through rule 34 and decided to watch some futanari porn, as it never disappoints me and is overall pretty nice porn in general in my opinion. I found this nice video and started… uhh you get it. Just a dude being a dude to some futanari. 

Literally right as I’m about to finish wanking, my fucking father comes in to tell me breakfasts ready. 

I don’t know who looked more traumatized and in shock. 

And when I thought it couldn’t get any fucking worse, I came. I fucking came all over my keyboard. It’s like we were both paralyzed with fear. He left a few minutes after standing still in fear, disappointment, and sadness. 

Breakfast was as awkward as it gets when you catch your son jerking off to futanari rule 34.

That was about as awkward as it gets when you get caught jerking off to anime chicks with dicks. My dad was in the military so he’s pretty tough and will probably get over this. However, for some odd reason I think this might just be more traumatizing than watching your own friends die in combat. 

I fucking hate myself and want to die. My friends are gonna bully me so hard if I tell them, and yet I feel like I need to confess about what happened. I think I can take being bullied by Reddit.

TLDR; Got caught watching hentai chicks with dicks, and I might get disowned.

Edit 1: Hey guys I got banned from Reddit and can only update posts. I removed the bi thing. My reasoning at the time was a girl who has a cock is pretty bi. I mean I’m attracted to girls and guys so a girl with a cock seemed pretty bi to me but I’m kinda wrong since straight people can also like futa.

Also fuck off you degenerates I’m not sharing the sauce. It’s a hardcore pounding video on nhentai. The girl has pink hair. I send you on a mighty fap quest to find it.

Dad got pissed and yelled at me. Mom cried. Life is awkward and I woke up to over 20k upvotes. Dad even threatened to kick me out. He’s a pussy though and didn’t do it. We had a talk. He’s seen weirder shit but he was surprised to see his own son like weird shit like futa and hentai. Mom might’ve disowned me but at this point I’m too numb to care.

sf1jri,"TIFU by being an unintentional wingman
At my gym over the past couple of months I've noticed a cute girl who works out around the same time I do and I was interested in asking her out, but I'm kind of awkward and I don't approach girls in the gym.

A few times I've seen her talk to a guy who she seems to be friends with, I haven't seen anything romantic or flirtatious between them and I was pretty confident they weren't together. So my awkward self decided to talk to the guy and ask him if she was single (very junior high of me I know). He said he had no idea, that they know each other because they used to work together, and have been friends ever since. As he was talking she came walking over to us, and before I could stop him he turned to ask her:

(Paraphrasing what I remember)

Him: hey are you single? Becau-

Her: God it's about time! I have been waiting forever for you to ask me out.

Him: uh...

Her: ...is that not what you were asking?

Him: yeah it is! Are you free Saturday?

Her: absolutely! Text me, I have to get going soon.


Throughout this I was just standing there like a third wheel watching like a doofus. After she left he turned to me with an apologetic look on his face and said he'd always had a crush on her but never acted because he didn't want to hurt their friendship if she didn't feel the same way. 

I told him I completely understood and was happy for both of them.

All in all, -1 for me and +2 for them = net gain for love.

My girlfriend came over to hang out before work today and we had a bit of fun, we might have gotten a bit carried away because when we’d both finished she looked a bit dazed and confused. I asked if everything was okay, and as she was staring into the middle distance she said  “I can’t see anything.”

She then told me she has a condition that causes her pupils to dilate when she’s crazy stressed or anxious and it causes her to temporarily go blind. (It’s called BEUM according to Google) apparently as we found out today, rough sex can trigger it too. 

She has to drive to work in an hour and currently can only see hazy stars 😬

u4y2k0,"TIFU by discovering a dark secret from a sex tape I made
So about 2 years ago, I was still living in my strict religious parents' house and the only way for me to find a place to have sex was to use my dad's office. My dad owns a small advertising business so on some weekends, I'll use the excuse of needing better network and needing to concentrate to get the keys to the office and have the girl meet me there. I know he and his staff never come to work on the weekend.  
So I was with this girl at the time and she was freaky af and asked if I had ever made a sex tape. I had, but as a gee, I knew the correct answer at that point was no, and once I said that, she pulled out my phone and placed it somewhere and we started to get freaky. I jerked off to it a couple of times after that at home (still my parent's house) before it became stale and I hid it and never really got back to it.  


2 years later and I'm now living in my own house and I have a girlfriend who's out of town for a few months. I was telling her about the sex tape and she didn't like that I still had it and told me to delete it. I decided to give it one last jerk off before deleting it, so I hit a blunt, plugged in my headphones and started watching like I had done a couple of times years before. It was late at night. I started to beat myself off, listening to this girl moan over the background noise of a movie we were playing to mask our noise... till I heard a deep voice (we'll pretend my name is Manny) in my head say clear as day ""Manny why? Why??""  
I jumped out of my chair. My door was locked. No one was in the house with me. I was panicking. Was this my conscience talking??? Is my girlfriend a witch??? Is this because I'm watching a video she doesn't want me to watch?? I'm panicking as hell becuase it fucking scared me how clear the voice was. I wanted to watch the video again, but I honestly was too scared so I walked around the house for a bit, just to let the highness fade, in case that was what was responsible for me hearing voices.  
Once I was a little sober (still very shaken up) I decided to start the video from the beginning but to focus this time. So I sat in my chair, dick in my pants (it definitely had no interest in rising again), headphones on, studying this video like it's my finals. While listening, I noticed that while I was blowing her back out, there was a little ruckus in the background separate from the direction the movie sound was coming from. My ears perked up. It was a conversation in the background. Someone had opened the office door

""Oh the lights are on. Is Manny in the office.""  
""I think so, the TV is on.""  
\*some silence  
""Oh my God! Manny! Oh my God, why?""   
""Why? Manny? Why??""

From the voices, I could tell one of them was my dad. I can only imagine the other person was my mum but I can't confirm because it was a bit further back. I have no idea what they were doing in the office that day but they definitely walked in on me, their good little boy, fucking a girl like an animal. And from the audio, they seemed to have stuck around a while after that (weird). This girl and I were absolutely lost in our oxytocin world, completely clueless that we had spectators.   
I must have missed it all those times I jerked off to it because I never jerked off with both earphones on in my parent's house (always gotta be alert) and the TV noise just drowned the background sound then.   
The coincidence is still baffling to me because I would have never found out if this girl hadn't suggested we make a sex tape. My parents definitely never mentioned anything to me about it. A lot of shit started to make sense because that was around the period where they clamped down on my freedom (which eventually led to me leaving the house) and started becoming hostile to me.   
The hardest part was explaining to my girlfriend the discovery I had just made. ""Hey babe, you won't believe what I found in the sex tape you told me to delete"".  


TL;DR: Watched a sex tape years after making it only to discover that my parents had walked in on me having sex while I was making it.

Edit 1: Thanks to Reddit, I now have the image of my dad being there with someone who wasn’t my mum to do the same thing. Unlikely though because the person would have to be very familiar with me to have the kind of conversation she was having with my dad. No such person. 

Edit 2: I’m a trash person for watching it again while with my girl. For context though, I’m a sex addict who hadn’t gone two days without sex in about a year till I quit cold turkey to start a relationship with someone who I wouldn’t be able to see for about 4 months. It didn’t seem like a smart decision seeing I was bound to fail, but I made it because I lucked out with someone who truly truly understands me. Sorry to disappoint the few of you hoping she left me. She didn’t. And when she sees this, I hope she knows I’m forever grateful to have her.",tifu,1281
ta60u1,"TIFU by saying that my neighbors daughters are hot
I (M, 33) live in Quebec, Canada. Here the official language is French, but almost everyone speaks English too.

The other day I was shoveling snow on my driveway and my neighbor (F ~35) was there too, removing snow from her car.

We share a driveway and we are very friendly. We always help each other and exchange gifts. I really love having them as neighbors.

Their family configuration is: mother, two daughters, one son and a father. But dad and mom are divorced. So on this day I finally met the father.

So he approached me talking in French, and I kinda can speak French, so I tried to maintain the conversation in French to be respectful. He said ""my daughters said you are a very good neighbor (mes filles m'on dit que tu est un très bon voisin)"" or something along these lines. 

I replied: merci! Elles sont très bonnes aussi !
I thought that meant ""thank you, they are very good too!

Again, my French is very limited. 

That actually means ""yes, they are very hot too""
Or ""very good to f*ck""

He started speaking English, and we had a pleasant conversation.

Weeks later I watch a video about the worst mistakes you can make in French. This was #1.

So now I know that I said to a Muslim father that they daughters and ex wife are hot.

TL;DR: my French speaking skills suck and I said to a man that his ex-wife and daughters are hot when I'm trying to say that they are very good (elles sont très bonnes, if you speak any French).

EDIT 1: some people from Quebec sent me messages saying that this is a ""France french"" expression (or metropolitan french). That is a relief, but not that much. Because I guess they learnt French from France, because they are from Lebanon.",tifu,1355

vi4kpy,"TIFU by asking for some hardcore bdsm from my boyfriend. And now I think I’m mentally scarred.
I am in no way shape or form blaming my bf, but I think I mentally scarred myself. I’ve been watching some pretty crazy shit recently, and I had the smart idea to try something out. I asked him if he could preform certain acts of BDSM with my consent. I wasn’t abused as a kid or anything. Idk, porn just glorified it enough to make me curious. We had safe words and everything. And when we did the deed, I was… conflicted to say the least. It was arousing, don’t get me wrong. But fuck, it also left me feeling helpless. I know it was kind of the point, but I was not prepared. I didn’t ask to stop because I was still getting off on it.

My bf was very against it at first since he was as vanilla as a person can be. but he said if I really wanted to try, he’d be up for it. The thing was, he actually enjoyed it. Like really enjoyed it. 

Anyways afterwards, I let him know that it wasn’t as fun as I’d thought it would be and that we wouldn’t do it again. He was understanding of course. But for some reason, I was kind of unnerved that he was really into it. And the weeks afterwards, I just kept thinking of how helpless. I’ve been less intimate with my boyfriend since then. Every time he touches me to initiate, I recoil. And every time I think of being intimate with him, I think of that night.

My boyfriend has been very supportive with me, saying it’s no big deal if we weren’t intimate. Just as long as I feel comfortable. The thing is, I’m not. He doesn’t know that this has been festering inside me and I actually feel like shit for feeling like this. It seems totally unfair to tell him about this because, like I literally asked for bdsm specifically! He’d feel like a total piece of shit for doing what I asked. It’s not his fault I woke some kink in him. 

Anyways, I think I’m gonna spend money on therapy to fix this myself, thanks for listening Reddit

TLDR: Asked my bf to be very rough with me during sex. It mentally scarred me and I feel like shit for feeling like shit. Can’t tell my bf because it’ll make him feel like shit because I’m a piece of shit for thinking it would be hot. So I’m going to therapy.

Edit: Hi! Shit. Didn’t expect this to blow up as big as it did. There is no way I’ll be able to read every comment, but I want to thank all of you! Even the “questionable” comments for the laughs. I just want to reiterate that I don’t blame my boyfriend at all. In fact I’m going to just up and tell him my feelings and apologize for being somewhat cold these last few weeks. We’re generally pretty good about communicating since we’ve been together for years. But idk, there’s something deeply personal about opening up about this. Like I know it’s hypocritical to be upset. But I can’t just turn off my anxiety. And I know he’s anxious about it too, but doesn’t want to open up either in fear of hurting my feelings too. That’s why I’ll just rip off the band aid. Anyways thanks again Reddit! And also sorting by controversial gave me some good laughs just from the insanity of a certain group of people lmao. I hope you guys find someone that loves you.

Edit 2: I let him in on the inner workings of my mind the other day. I made it very clear that I am not voluntarily trying to hold it against it. Rather it the result of some trauma that I brought upon myself for my lack of preparation. I apologized for being relatively cold for the last weeks, and we made it. He knew something was up and felt really bad, and I reassured it it was all on me. I showed him the Reddit post just for transparency. Anyways, we’re both gonna go to therapy to deal with any trauma induced symptoms. Because that’s what it is, symptoms that I want to get treated. It isn’t me, nor do I want to be dictated by it. Anyways, have a lovely day peeps! And to all the people at the top of controversial sort, I mean it. I hope you find someone that will love you ❤️",tifu,2636
vttdje,"TIFU by thinking getting constant UTIs was normal.
Some backstory: I used to get a lot of UTIs. Like, _a lot_ a lot, no matter what I did. Boyfriend and I would both shower before sex, I would pee immediately after, I drank water like a camel, took urinary health supplements, everything I could think of. I would still get 8-12 of them a year, a couple of which turned into kidney infections and landed me in the hospital. I was constantly on antibiotics, and at one point I was prescribed an antibiotic to take every time after I had sex. It destroyed my gut bacteria and pH balance down there, and I was miserable and in pain constantly. 


I was told pretty much the same thing by every doctor I went to: I need to pee after sex, drink more water, etc. I told them I was already doing all of these things, and they said some women just get them more frequently than others for some reason.


The last time I ended up in the ER with a kidney infection, the kind ER doctor told me that in his 45+ years of practicing medicine, he had never seen a healthy young woman have that many UTIs. There is absolutely something wrong, and I need to see a specialist about it ASAP. 


Fast forward 4 weeks and a referral to a urologist later, my doctor runs a series of tests. One of these tests is a uroscopy which, if you’ve never had one, is where a very small camera is inserted into your bladder through your urethra and is just about as pleasant as it sounds. It didn’t take my doctor long to discover the cause of my constant UTIs: there was a growth/tumor in there. It had formed a pocket which the doctor said was collecting bacteria, contributing to both the frequency and severity of my UTIs being increased. 


Since there was no way to know if this was a birth defect, a benign growth, or literal cancer without a biopsy, surgery was scheduled immediately to have it removed. The biopsy found that it was not cancerous, which I am infinitely grateful for. Since recovering from surgery, I have not had a single UTI, have gotten off antibiotics, and am able to have a normal sex life with my boyfriend without the fear getting sent to the hospital. My fuck up is that I suffered for years and years instead of getting help, thinking that what I was going through was normal.


TL;DR My constant UTIs were being caused by a growth inside of my bladder, and I spent years suffering before getting treatment because I was told women getting frequent UTIs was normal.",tifu,976
si7vjv,"TIFU by not taking a teenager's business idea seriously enough
 About a year ago I was approached by a 16 year old kid on LinkedIn with an business idea he wanted me to work with him on I assumed a ""for free until funding"" basis (I'm a UX designer).

I thought it was weird to be randomly contacted, but the foundations of his idea I thought were really solid and had growth potential, so I organized a call to discuss details etc. He ended up not being able to attend that call, and when he reached out to reschedule the message just slipped through my inbox unread for a while. After all, it was just a young guy with big dreams, how many guys are out there saying they've got the next big startup idea? So a week goes past and I forget about rescheduling, and then a month goes past and I forget about the idea altogether.

A year goes past and I see his company in the news receiving over $2m in venture capital funding.

TL;DR - Didn't take 16yo with startup idea seriously, missed out on a good growth opportunity",tifu,522

Exactly what the title says, I (29M), did what every dude fear of doing: Rubbing your girlfriend’s clit and finding out it is NOT her clit.

Usually I’m great at finding it whenever we’re going at it, but tonight was not my night, when things were getting hot and heavy, I slipped my fingers down there and did the usual. My girlfriend (26F) asked what I was rubbing and I replied, “Your clit….?” And in confusion she replied, “No, I’m not feeling anything.”  

For a second I was thrown off because how is she not feeling what I was rubbing for the past five minutes? So I poked what I thought was her clit and asked, “You mean this?” And by doing that, whatever the fucked I poked, caused her to yell in pain, “Yes, that!” 

It turned out that above her hood was  this cyst that was the same size as her clit and that’s what I was rubbing for the past 5 mins. Huge mood killer for the both of us, and now she’s upset that she has this weird pimple that she didn’t know of until now. I tried to comfort her but she’s not wanting to listen.

TL;DR Rubbed what I thought was my gf’s clit, turned out to be a big cyst above it. FML

EDIT: Turned out to be an ingrown hair, no I’m not posting it on r/popping you nasties.

EDIT 2: Since everyone is asking why she didn’t feel it for a while, it wasn’t that long of a time, like maybe a minute when she noticed it. Anyways, thanks for the advice, girlfriend is feeling better and it’s just a laughable memory.",tifu,1240
v4iafl,"TIFU by playing with my tinder dates cat
Throwaway account because this is really embarrassing. This actually happened today, about 30 minutes ago. 

So I went on a tinder date with this girl last night, it was great, she's really pretty and we had a great time. We came back to her place as it was close by and ended up doing the deed multiple times and ended up in bed. Now I haven't had much action in a while and it really tired me out, so I slept like a rock.

Fast forward to about half an hour ago and I wake up butt naked, alone in her bed, but I can hear her downstairs in the kitchen. So I'm tossing and turning for a bit when all of a sudden this gorgeous grey floofy kitty comes and hops on the bed and starts purring like mad, I happily oblige and pet the shit out of it. I love cats. I didn't have the covers on me as it was hot and this cat felt so soft, flopping itself against my skin. 

So the cat starts getting playful, hopping over my body from one side to the next, and I'm rolling side to side tickling its belly inbetween, but when I roll ove next, my schlong flips over with me, sailing through the air in a perfect arch, just before it slapped my belly the cat pounced straight onto it and dug two paws in, one on the shaft and one on the head (much like last night). I fucking screamed in agony, sat up and started trying to pull its claws out my sausage. The one on my head came off straight away but there was a claw still hanging on for dear life about halfway down which was fully lodged. The cat started to panic because it was stuck. I heard my date running upstairs and as she came in I was sat up with her cat buried in my crotch holding onto its leg trying to free it. I whimpered 'cock stuck, help' and she burst out laughing but reached over and unhooked the last claw out my shaft, leaving me naked and embarrassed. 

I waddled over to the bathroom with blood trickling down onto my ballsack and sat on the toilet dabbing the little holes with tissue. I'm still sat here now, with tissue pressed against my member as it write this. Going to have a shower I think.

tl;dr Played with my tinder dates cat the morning after and they thought my cock was a toy, claws got stuck in multiple places now I have a sore penis.

Edit: OK I've been reading a lot of comments and apparantly I should see a doctor?? How the fuck do I explain this scenario??",tifu,1117
